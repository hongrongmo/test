      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to methods for producing a two-component polyurethane composition comprising one or more additives soluble in polar solvents, in particular biocides. Furthermore, it relates to two-component polyurethane compositions comprising one or more additives soluble in polar solvents, in particular biocides, obtainable by one of the methods according to the invention, and to the use of two-component polyurethane compositions comprising one or more additives soluble in polar solvents, in particular biocides, for producing foams and adhesives.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Hitherto, concentrated solutions of polar solvents which comprise additives soluble in polar solvents have only been able to be stably mixed into aqueous systems or single-component polyurethane compositions with a high water content on account of their solubility during the production in particular of foams. In the case of adhesives, a mixing-in only into hydrogels or aqueous dispersions was possible. With the exception in the case of the hydrogels, in all other cases an expensive drying step is necessary. Moreover, it is known that in the case of two-component polyurethanes the reaction between isocyanate and water competes with the reaction between isocyanate and polyols. For the modifiability, such as e.g. the adjustment of the physical and mechanical properties, of two-component polyurethanes, therefore, a small water fraction is desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The equipping of adhesives and absorbent foams with additives dissolved in polar solvents, in particular with biocides such as DMDM hydantoin, cetylpyridinium chloride, polyhexamethylenebiguanide (PHMB), their derivatives or mixtures thereof, dissolved in aqueous solution, or biocides such as clioquinol, triclosan and triphenylmethane dyes, their derivatives and mixtures thereof, dissolved in alcoholic solutions are required for diverse applications in medical technology.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Particularly hydrophilic, absorbent wound foams which are intended for absorbing infected wound exudate from the wound are preferably equipped with biocides in order to be able to kill the absorbed microorganisms, Adhesives equipped with biocides likewise have a broad application spectrum in medical technology and are used wherever a biocidal effect is also required as well as the joining of two substrates. This is the case for example for incision films or for catheter plasters.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">For the production and biocidal equipping of a hydrophilic wound foam with very good absorption and retention properties, a formulation described in WO 2011015568 has been used which, on account of the high fraction of hydrophilic polymers, is particularly suited for the absorption and binding of wound exudates. The total water content in the polyol here is less than 5%. The direct mixing in of a 20% aqueous PHMB solution in the biocidally effective end concentration into the polyol mixture resulted immediately in a precipitate and the formation of a sticky PHMB sediment (comparative example 1). A mixing in of the PHMB solution in a lower concentration would be possible without exceptions, but as a result the required biocidally effective end concentration of for example 0.15%, based on the polyurethane foam, is not thereby achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">For the equipping of polyurethane wound foams with aqueous biocidal solutions which comprise PHMB, DMDM hydantoin, cetylpyridinium chloride, their derivatives or mixtures thereof, there are currently two approaches according to the prior art: often, the prepolymer-based wound foams are single-component systems and are foamed with a very high water content as e.g. in US 2010021514 A1 or WO 2004007595 A1. As a result, however, the formulation scope of hydrophilic polyols and therefore the subsequent ability to absorb and retain wound exudates is limited. Alternatively, the finished foams are impregnated after production with water-containing, biocidal solutions, which does not ensure a uniform distribution of the biocidal components on the surface. Moreover, the second case results in a âbulk releaseâ of the biocidal components, as a result of which the activity subsides within a few hours after application (Wilhelms et al. (2007), âFreisetzung von Polyhexamethylenbiguandd (PHMB) aus der Wundauflage Suprasorb X+PHMB [Release of polyhexamethylenebiguanide (PHMB) from the wound covering Suprasorb X+PHMB]â, poster presentation DGfW). In both cases, a time-consuming and cost-intensive drying step has to be carried out.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">EP 2 338 923 A1 describes a polyurethane which comprises a polyurea of two terminal isocyanates and a biocidal guanidinium as comonomer. The polyurethanes can be used to produce for example foams for mattresses. The biocidal additive here is incorporated directly into the polymer matrix and provides for the biocidal effect on the surface of the polymer. Disadvantages of EP 2 338 923 A1 are that firstly a high concentration of guanidinium (about 3%) has to be used to attain the biocidal effect and secondly that in the case of polymerizing in the biocide no long-distance effect as a result of release of the additives is possible, as is required for example for wound foams.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">WO 9302717 A1 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,717,500 A describe the mixing in of chlorhexidine gluconate or other aqueous, biocide-containing solutions into aqueous dispersion adhesives which have to be applied to for example polyurethane films and then dried to achieve the adhesive strength.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">As described in WO 2010/024928 A1 and WO 2010/025219 A1, biocidal hydrogel adhesives are used as âsandwichâ constituents in absorbent wound coverings. The use of hydrogel adhesives here, however, have the disadvantage that, on account of their high water content, they have a tendency to dry out during use on the patient and therefore adversely influence the release and the efficacy of the biocidal components. The production of antimicrobial hydrogel adhesives is also very time-consuming on account of the long crosslinking times and pot lives.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">It is therefore the object of the invention to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art, i.e. in particular to make it possible for solutions of polar solvents which comprise additives soluble in polar solvents to be able to he incorporated, in few working steps and without high time expenditure, into a two-component polyurethane composition without the additives agglomerating and precipitating out, or so much water being necessary that this leads to a high extent to secondary reactions with the, added isocyanates. Moreover, a drying step of a two-component polyurethane foam or adhesive should be avoided as far as possible, and a uniform distribution and prolonged efficacy of the additive as a result of delayed release should be ensured.</p>

Chlorhexidine and tauroline can likewise be used in the context of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The carrier materials used in this method for additives soluble in polar solvents are inorganic fillers, in particular those with a BET surface area of â§10 m<sup>2</sup>g preferably determined in accordance with DIN ISO 9277:2003-05); they are preferably hydrophilic inorganic fillers. Likewise particularly preferred fillers in the context are pyrogenic silica and silica gels with a BET surface area of â§10 m<sup>2</sup>g (preferably determined in accordance with DIN ISO 9277:2003-05), as are known and commercially available for example under the trade names AerosilÂ® and AerodispÂ®.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In the method described above, in a first step firstly at least one polyol is provided. Preference is given to using polyethylene glycols with the molecular weights between 100 and 8000, particularly preferably those with molecular weights between 200 and 4000. Furthermore, PEG/PPG copolymers with molecular weights between 100 and 8000, particularly preferably molecular weights between 200 and 4000, can be used. Moreover, a polyol can be used which comprises at least one compound with at least two or more hydroxyl groups. Preferably, the polyol comprises a composition of two or more compounds with two or more hydroxyl groups.

Furthermore, polyester triols such as castor oil and sulfonated castor oil can be used. Preferably, polyester triols are added to the polyol. This leads to a higher polymerization density within the polyurethane.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Preferably, polyesters with hydroxyl groups are encompassed by the polyol. Examples of such compounds are: polycaprolactonediol and polycaprolactonetriol. Further examples are Î±,Ï-dihydroxypoly(D,L-lactide), Î±,Ï-dihydroxypoly(D-lactide), Î±,Ï-dihydroxypoly(L-lactide), â,Ï-dihydroxypoly(glycolide), Î±,Ï-dihydroxypoly(hydroxybutyrate) and other aliphatic polyesters and their copolymers including segmented block copolymers of polyether and polyester segments, as obtainable by the reaction with high molecular weight polyesters with hydroxyl-terminal poly (alkylene glycols), and also a composition of such polyols.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Particular preference is given to compounds which are biocompatible.

The at least one polyethylene glycol can be branched or unbranched and preferably have an average molecular weight of from 100 to 15,000, particularly preferably between 300 and 5000. Preferably, the polyol comprises a composition of polyethylene glycols with different average molecular weights, The at least one poly(s-caprolactone) can be branched or unbranched and preferably have a molecular weight between 100 and 15,000, particularly preferably between 100 and 1000.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In a second step, at least one solution of a polar solvent comprising at least one additive soluble in polar solvents, in particular a water-soluble or alcohol-soluble additive, in particular a biocide, and also at least one carrier material for the additive soluble in polar solvents is added to the polyol or polyols.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">An additive soluble in polar solvents incorporated into a polyol under these conditions is particularly storage-stable. Without being bound to one theory, it is assumed that the additive soluble in polar solvents can be reversibly adsorbed to the surface of the carrier material, for example via hydrogen bridge bonds, van-der-Waals forces or ionic bonds, such that it is released from the two-component polyurethane.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">After adding at least one solution of a polar solvent comprising at least one additive soluble in polar solvents, in particular a water-soluble or alcohol-soluble additive, in particular a biocide, and the carrier material for the additive soluble in polar solvents to the polyol or polyols, in a further step at least one isocyanate is provided in order to then add it to this mixture and, with the further addition of a catalyst, to obtain a two-component polyurethane composition comprising at least one additive soluble in polar solvents. As a result of the above-described storage stability of the polyol mixture comprising at least one additive soluble in polar solvents and at least one carrier material for additives soluble in polar solvents, the addition of at least one isocyanate can optionally also take place at a different time.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Particular preference is given to aliphatic isocyanates such as 1,6-diisocyanatohexane (HDI) or dicyclohexamethane diisocyanate (H12MDI) or their prepolymers. Furthermore, preferred isocyanates are substituted or unsubstituted alkylene diisocyanates with 3 to 12 carbon atoms such as e.g. lysine ddisocyanate, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkylene diisocyanates with 5 to 15 carbon atoms such as cyclohexylene diisocyanate; substituted or unsubstituted alkylcycloalkylene dilsocyanates having 6 to 18 carbon atoms such as isophorone diisocyanate; substituted or unsubstituted aromatic dlisocyanates such as p-phenylenediisocyanate, tolyienediisocvanate (all isomers and compositions thereof), 4,4â²-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and isomers, trimers, higher oligomers, uretdiones, cyanurates and isocyanurates of these diisocyanates.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Moreover, particular preference is given to 1,4-diisocyanatobutane isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), lysimethyl ester diisocyanate (LDI) or 4,4â²-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI).</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The provision as required of at least one isocyanate in the method described above takes place for example by using the isocyanate or isocyanates packaged together with at least one polyol, with at least one solution of a polar solvent comprising at least one additive soluble in polar solvents, in particular a water-soluble or alcohol-soluble additive, in particular a biocide, and with at least one carrier material for additives soluble in polar solvents, and/or directions are to be found on or in the packaging which explain the use of the isocyanate or isocyanates.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">A further method for producing a two-component polyurethane composition comprising at least one additive soluble in polar solvents, in particular a water-soluble or alcohol-soluble additive, in particular a biocide, is characterized in that it involves the following steps:</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0000">a) mixing at least one solution of a polar solvent comprising at least one additive soluble in polar solvents, in particular a water-soluble or alcohol-soluble additive, in particular a biocide, with at least one carrier material for the additive soluble in polar solvents; <br /> b) drying of the mixture from step a); <br /> c) adding the dried mixture from step b) to at least one polyol; and <br /> d) provision as required of at least one isocyanate for the addition to the mixture from step c). </p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0032">The water-soluble additives added to a two-component polyurethane composition in this method have a solubility in water of at least 10% by weight, preferably of 25% by weight and particularly preferably of 40% by weight.</p>

      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0036">This mixture is then dried, followed by the addition of the dried mixture to at least one polyol.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0037">Suitable polyols are described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0038">In a further step, at least one isocyanate is provided in order to add it to this mixture and to complete a polymerization of a two-component polyurethane composition with the aid of a catalyst.</p>

In parallel to this, a mixture was prepared consisting of 20 g of PEG 400, 10 g of aqueous 20% PHMB solution (water fraction 8 g). The mixture immediately turned cloudy, which is attributed to a precipitation of the PHMB. After dispersion has taken place by means of a dispersing disk (d=6 cm) at 1000 rpm, 12.18 g of this masterbatch were added to the polyol mixture at 75-80Â° C. and vigorously stirred, during which the cloudiness of the mixture did not dissolve. Then, 4.55 g of Coscat 83 and 2.28 g of DMDEE were added and the mixture was held for 90 min at best subatmospheric pressure and 90Â° C. The mixture was transferred to a sheet-metal pack and stored overnight at 70Â°. A sticky precipitate was formed at the bottom of the pack. The analogous preparation of a mixture with 3.96 g of water instead of the 20% strength aqueous PHMB solution did not lead to any precipitation during the mixing and also after prolonged storage.</p>
