      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In conventional spectral CT imaging, it has been shown that energy-weighting, whether in the image-domain or the data-domain, improves the contrast-to-noise ratio. Conventionally, photon-counting detectors use a set of predetermined energy thresholds to count the number of events falling into predetermined energy ranges. However, no practical implementation of energy-weighting at the detector level is known.</p>

      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">According to one embodiment, there is provided an apparatus, comprising a digital processing circuit configured to (1) obtain a digital signal corresponding to an output signal of a photon-counting detector; (2) determine, from the obtained digital signal, a plurality of X-ray photons received by the photon-counting detector during a measurement period; (3) determine a corresponding energy level of each of the plurality of X-ray photons; (4) determine, based on the corresponding energy level, a corresponding weight for each of the plurality of X-ray photons; and (5) calculate a sum of the corresponding weights of the plurality of X-ray photons.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In another embodiment, the apparatus includes an analog-to-digital converter circuit configured to generate the digital signal from the output signal of the photon-counting detector.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In another embodiment, the apparatus includes a preamplifier configured to amplify the output signal of the photon-counting detector to generate an amplified signal, wherein the amplified signal is input to the analog-to-digital converter circuit.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In another embodiment, the digital processing circuit is configured to determine the corresponding weight to be proportional to an inverse of the corresponding energy level cubed.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In another embodiment, the digital processing circuit is configured to determine the corresponding weight by accessing a programmable look-up table.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In another embodiment, the apparatus includes a memory configured to store the calculated sum as an energy-weighted bin value.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">According to another embodiment, there is provided a computed tomography scanner, comprising: (1) an X-ray source; (2) a plurality of photon-counting detectors; and (3) a plurality of data acquisition devices, each data acquisition device including a digital processing circuit configured to obtain a digital signal corresponding to an output signal of a photon-counting detector; determine, from the obtained digital signal, a plurality of X-ray photons received by the photon-counting detector during a measurement period; determine a corresponding energy level of each of the plurality of X-ray photons; determine, based on the corresponding energy level, a corresponding weight for each of the plurality of X-ray photons; and calculate a sum of the corresponding weights of the plurality of X-ray photons.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a system in which the signal output from a photon-counting detector device <b>102</b> is input into a set of comparators <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>108</b>, etc. The comparators <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>108</b> have a corresponding set of predetermined energy thresholds, denoted by E1, E2, and E3, etc. and one of the comparators produces an output signal when the energy level of the signal output from the photon-counting detector falls within a corresponding one of the energy ranges determined by the predetermined energy thresholds. The output of each comparator is connected to a corresponding counter <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>114</b>, etc., which counts the number of received photons at the corresponding energy range.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">However, the approach illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is limited because the finite number of energy thresholds (E1, E2, E3 . . . ) defeats the possibility of energy-weighted binning at the detector level.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Thus, according to one embodiment, a device that performs energy-weighted binning at the detector level is disclosed. A photon-counting detector resolves the energy of each received X-ray, which is discernable from the output signal of the photon-counting detector. For example, the received X-ray can have any energy value, e.g., E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub>, . . . , or E<sub>n</sub>. Pre-loaded energy-correlated weights, denoted by W(E<sub>1</sub>), W(E<sub>2</sub>), . . . ,W(E<sub>n</sub>), are used such that one of the weights is obtained for each corresponding X-ray photon having a given energy. For example, if an X-ray photon of energy E<sub>1 </sub>is received, the weight W(E<sub>1</sub>) is obtained, e.g., from a look-up table. Note that a finite number of weights/energy levels can be used, or the weights can be a more general function of the energy. The optimum number of weights is determined by the energy resolution. For example, after reaching the optimum, adding more weights only costs more in the implementation, but does not gain anything in performance. The implementation can be a lookup table (with pre-calculated weights) or a function to be calculated in realtime using a DSP or an FPGA, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Next, all of the obtained weights obtained in a predetermined scan or measurement period are summed to calculate an energy-weighted bin value.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In one embodiment, each weight can be proportional to a power of the corresponding energy E, where the power is dependent on the clinical application. For example, each weight W(E,) can be proportional to 1/E<sub>i</sub><sup>3</sup>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrated a practical device for implementing the detector-level energy-weighted disclosed herein. <figref>FIG. 3</figref> uses a combination of a high-speed ADC (analog-to-digital converter) <b>306</b> and a digital processing circuit <b>308</b> to perform energy-weighted binning at the detector level. In <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the output of photon-counting detector <b>302</b> is input into a preamplifier <b>304</b>. The output of the preamplifier <b>304</b>, which is shown in graph <b>410</b> in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, is input into the ADC <b>306</b>, which produces the digitized signal shown in graph <b>420</b> in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. The digitized signal output from the ADC is input to the digital signal processing circuit <b>308</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">As shown in graph <b>430</b> in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the digital processing circuit <b>308</b> analyzes the digitized signal output from the ADC in real time to detect a plurality of photons and their corresponding energy levels, and for each detected photon, e.g., having an energy E, obtains (e.g., using a look-up table) a weight W<sub>E </sub>corresponding to the energy level E of the photon. The digital processing circuit further sums of all the obtained weights W<sub>E </sub>during a measurement period to form the energy-weighted bin value.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram that shows how the energy-weighted bin value is obtained by the digital processing circuit according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. Elements <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, and <b>206</b> represent a photon detected by the digital processing having a corresponding energy value E1, E2, and E3, respectively. Elements <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> represent weights W(E1), W(E2), W(E3) that are obtained corresponding to the energy values E1, E2, and E3, respectively. The weights are summed by the summer <b>214</b> to produce the energy-weighted bin value <b>216</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The disclosed embodiments have several advantages over conventional approaches, e.g., an improved contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Further, the disclosed detector-level energy weighting significantly reduces the processing time compared to image-domain energy weighting, while having the same CNR advantages. Further, in the present embodiments, the method of calculating the weights in the digital processing circuit can be easily modified to suit a particular application.</p>
