      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to a cutlery and, more particularly, to an interchangeable cutlery block that accommodates various numbers and sizes of cutlery.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Cutlery utensils, such as knives, come in various forms and sizes and are used for numerous applications. Generally, a knife has a blade portion at one end and a handle portion at an opposite end. A tang, which is typically formed integrally with the blade portion, extends into the handle portion and is secured therein by various means.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">When not in use, cutlery utensils can be stored or stowed in knife blocks, which can also be provided in various designs, forms, and sizes. Knife blocks generally include one or more slots of uniform or varying widths defined on a receiving end of the knife block. The slots are adapted to receive and seat the cutlery utensils such that at least a portion of each blade is extended into and otherwise disposed within the interior of the knife block. Some knife blocks are made of wood and the slots are defined by strategically removing slot-shaped portions of the wood with a table saw or other machine from the receiving end. Other types of knife blocks include a block shell that is filled with elongate plastic rods that allow for a universal slot for various sizes of knives.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Traditionally, manufacturing knife blocks of varying configurations and slot sizes can be challenging and costly. It is often necessary to design and use different overall structural knife block designs to accommodate a myriad of configurations. As such, it is often necessary to invest in tooling for the entirety of the knife block in order to meet the challenge of manufacturing the various configurations.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The present invention is provided to solve the problems discussed above and other problems, and to provide advantages and aspects not provided by knife blocks. A full discussion of the present invention is deferred to the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">According to one embodiment, a knife block is disclosed. The knife block includes a base, a body and a cap. The body has a first end and a second end. The body is coupled to the base at the first end and extends from the base. The cap is removably coupled to the second end of the body and defines one or more slots therein. Each slot is configured to receive a portion of a cutlery utensil therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">A method of assembling a knife block with an interchangeable blade receiving cap is also disclosed. According to the method, a first cap is extended at least partially into an end of a body of a knife block and removably securing the first cap within the end of the body.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Other features of the invention will be apparent from the following specification taken in conjunction with the following drawings.</p>

      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a full understanding of the subject technology. It will be apparent, however, to one ordinarily skilled in the art that the subject technology may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and techniques have not been shown in detail so as not to obscure the subject technology.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The present disclosure generally relates to cutlery and, more particularly, to an interchangeable knife block that accommodates various numbers and sizes of cutlery.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The embodiments of the present disclosure describe a knife block that includes a cap attached and arranged at a receiving end of the knife block. The cap includes one or more slots that may exhibit varying sizes, numbers, and/or configurations. The cap may be configured to be removed from the knife block by a user or manufacturer and interchanged with a second cap having one or more slots that exhibit different sizes, numbers, and/or configurations than the first cap. As a result, a user or manufacturer may be able to selectively choose the cap for the knife block to accommodate a desired number and/or sizing of cutlery utensils. As can be appreciated, this will allow for multiple knives and knife counts to be used in the same knife block assembly by changing only one component or part of the assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref>, illustrated is an embodiment of an exemplary knife block <b>100</b>, according to one or more embodiments. More particularly, <figref>FIG. 1</figref> depicts an isometric view of the knife block <b>100</b>, <figref>FIG. 2</figref> depicts a cross-sectional isometric view of the knife block <b>100</b>, and <figref>FIG. 3</figref> depicts an isometric, bottom view of the receiving end of the knife block <b>100</b>. As illustrated, the knife block <b>100</b> includes a base <b>102</b>, a cap <b>104</b>, and a body <b>106</b> that generally extends between the base <b>102</b> and the cap <b>104</b>. Each of the base <b>102</b>, the cap <b>104</b>, and the body <b>106</b> may be made of a variety of materials including, but not limited to, plastics, metals, composites (e.g., fiberglass, carbon fiber, etc.), ceramics, wood, and any combination thereof. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate, however, that the base <b>102</b>, the cap <b>104</b>, and the body <b>106</b> may each be made of any rigid material, without departing from the scope of the disclosure. It should also be understood that one or more of the base <b>102</b>, the cap <b>104</b>, and the body <b>106</b> may each be made of a flexible or elastic material such as, for example, a thermoplastic elastomer or silicone, without departing from the scope of the disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The base <b>102</b> provides a surface or location where the knife block <b>100</b> may be able rest upon an opposing planar surface (i.e., a table, countertop, etc.). The base <b>102</b> is coupled to the body <b>106</b> via a variety of fastening techniques. For example, the base <b>102</b> may be coupled to the body <b>106</b> using a snap-fit engagement, one or more mechanical fasteners, an interference fit, adhesives, sonic welding, melding, and any combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The body <b>106</b> generally extends vertically from the base <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the body <b>106</b> may extend substantially orthogonal to the planar surface of the base <b>102</b>. In other embodiments, however, as illustrated, the body <b>106</b> may extend from the base <b>102</b> at an angle offset from orthogonal. Extending at an angle offset from orthogonal may prove advantageous in placing the receiving end of the knife block <b>100</b> such that it is ergonomically accessible by a user. As a result, this may facilitate easier access to knives (not shown) that can be stowed within the knife block <b>100</b>, but also arranges the receiving end so that a user can more easily locate slots defined therein to insert knife blades.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The body <b>106</b> defines or otherwise provides an interior <b>108</b> (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>). The base <b>102</b> generally encloses the interior <b>108</b> at the bottom end of the knife block <b>100</b>, and the cap <b>104</b> generally encloses the interior <b>108</b> at the receiving end. As described herein, the blade(s) of one or more knives may be extended through the cap <b>104</b> and into the interior <b>108</b> in order to properly store or stow the knives in the knife block <b>100</b>. Accordingly, in at least one embodiment, the interior <b>108</b> may be generally vacuous. In other embodiments, however, the interior <b>108</b> may be at least partially filled with a fluid, without departing from the scope of the disclosure. In still other embodiments, the interior <b>108</b> may be partially filled with a solid or semi-solid material.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In some embodiments, the body <b>106</b> may be made of a single monolithic component that defines the sides of the knife block <b>100</b> extending between the base <b>102</b> and the cap <b>104</b>. In other embodiments, however, the body <b>106</b> may be made of multiple components. As illustrated, for example, the body <b>106</b> may include a faceplate <b>110</b> and a shroud <b>112</b> operatively coupled to the faceplate <b>110</b>. The faceplate <b>110</b> may be coupled or otherwise secured to the shroud <b>112</b> using a snap-fit engagement, one or more mechanical fasteners, an interference fit, adhesives, sonic welding, melding, and any combination thereof. The faceplate <b>110</b> may include a pedestal <b>114</b> that transitions from the faceplate <b>110</b> and extends substantially horizontal and otherwise parallel with the base <b>102</b>. The pedestal <b>114</b> may be configured to be coupled to the base <b>102</b> in order to provide stability to the knife block <b>100</b> in its angled configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The cap <b>104</b> may be characterized as the receiving end of the knife block <b>100</b>. To this end, the cap <b>104</b> may include or otherwise define one or more slots <b>116</b> (four shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). Each slot <b>116</b> may extend through the cap <b>104</b> and may be configured to receive the blade of a corresponding knife to be stowed in the knife block <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the shape and width of each slot <b>116</b> may vary one from another to accommodate various sizes and shapes of knives or other cutlery utensils (e.g., knife sharpening rods).</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">One or more of the slots <b>116</b> may have a corresponding blade sleeve <b>118</b> that extends therefrom into the interior <b>108</b> of the knife block <b>100</b>. According to one embodiment depicted in <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the blade sleeves <b>118</b> may exhibit substantially the same size and width as its corresponding slot <b>116</b> and extend a short distance into the interior <b>108</b>. It will be understood, however, that the width of the collar may vary along its length without departing from the present disclosure. As can be appreciated, the blade sleeves <b>118</b> may prove advantageous in providing elongate guides for knife blades extended through the slots <b>116</b> and into the interior <b>108</b>. More particularly, each blade sleeve <b>118</b> may help to align knife blades as they are inserted into the knife block <b>100</b> so that adjacent blades remain isolated from each other and otherwise do not mar or damage one another.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In some embodiments, the blade sleeve <b>118</b> may be omitted from one or more (or all) of the slots <b>116</b>. Moreover, while depicted in <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> as extending a certain longitudinal distance into the interior <b>108</b>, and otherwise exhibiting a length <b>120</b> (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>), those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the blade sleeves <b>118</b> may extend into the interior <b>108</b> to any distance or length <b>120</b>, without departing from the scope of the disclosure. For instance, in at least one embodiment, one or more of the blade sleeves <b>118</b> may exhibit a length <b>120</b> that extends all the way to the base <b>102</b>. Furthermore, while the length <b>120</b> of each blade sleeve <b>118</b> is depicted in <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> as being substantially uniform (i.e., of approximately the same length), it will further be appreciated that the length <b>120</b> of each blade sleeve <b>118</b> may be unique. In other embodiments, the length of two or more of the blade sleeves <b>118</b> may be substantially the same but dissimilar to the length of the remaining blade sleeves <b>118</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">According to the present disclosure, the cap <b>104</b> may be an interchangeable component of the knife block <b>100</b>. More particularly, the cap <b>104</b> may be designed such that it can be replaced by a user or manufacturer with a different cap that provides a different number or configuration of slots <b>116</b>. Accordingly, an appropriately designed cap <b>104</b> may be selected by a user or manufacturer to be installed in the knife block <b>100</b> in order to accommodate varying numbers and sizes of knife blades.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In at least one embodiment, as illustrated, the cap <b>104</b> may be secured to the body <b>106</b> via a snap-fit engagement. More particularly, the cap <b>104</b> may be configured to be inserted a short distance into the interior <b>108</b> and may include one or more lips <b>122</b> (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). The lips <b>122</b> may extend from the cap <b>104</b> and may be configured to engage a shoulder <b>124</b> (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>) defined on at least one of the inner surfaces of the body <b>106</b>. To assemble the cap <b>104</b> to the body <b>106</b>, the cap <b>104</b> may be extended into the interior <b>108</b> of the body <b>106</b>, which results in the lips <b>122</b> flexing inward. As the cap <b>104</b> progresses into the interior <b>108</b>, the lips <b>122</b> may eventually locate the shoulder <b>124</b> and flex outward and into engagement therewith, thereby forming a snap-fit engagement. The snap-fit engagement may prove useful in allowing a user to reverse the assembly process to remove the cap <b>104</b> such that it can be interchanged with a new (differently configured) cap that exhibits a different configuration or design of the slots <b>116</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">While described herein as a snap-fit engagement, the cap <b>104</b> may be removably attached to the body <b>106</b> via a variety of other means, without departing from the scope of the disclosure. For example, in some embodiments, the cap <b>104</b> may be mechanically fastened to the body <b>106</b>, such as through the use of one or more threaded fasteners. In other embodiments, the cap <b>104</b> may be secured to the body <b>106</b> via an interference fit, where the outer dimensions of the cap <b>104</b> are slightly smaller than the inner dimensions of the body <b>106</b>. In such embodiments, if desired, the user or manufacturer may be able to overcome the interference fit to remove and replace the cap <b>104</b> with a new cap that exhibits a different configuration or design of the slots <b>116</b>. It should be understood that in some embodiments the cap <b>104</b> can be permanently affixed to the body <b>306</b> once the knife block is assembled to its final form.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 4-6</figref>, with continued reference to <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref>, illustrated is an embodiment of another exemplary knife block <b>200</b>, according to one or more embodiments. The knife block <b>200</b> may be substantially similar to the knife block <b>100</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref> and therefore may be best understood with reference thereto, where like numerals represent like elements not described again in detail. More particularly, the knife block <b>200</b> includes the base <b>102</b> and the body <b>106</b>, as generally described above. The knife block <b>200</b>, however, may further include a cap <b>202</b> that is different from the cap <b>104</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref>, but nonetheless able to be removably attached to the body <b>106</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Again, the cap <b>202</b> may be characterized as the receiving end of the knife block <b>200</b> and includes or otherwise defines one or more slots <b>116</b> (five shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>) therein. The shape and width of each slot <b>116</b> in the cap <b>202</b> may vary one from another to accommodate various sizes and shapes of knives or other cutlery utensils (e.g., knife sharpening rods). One or more of the sizes, shapes, and/or disposition of the slots <b>116</b> in the cap <b>202</b> may be different than the slots <b>116</b> in the cap <b>104</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref>. For instance, the slots <b>116</b> in the cap <b>104</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref> are depicted as being disposed or defined laterally A (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>) with respect to the cap <b>104</b>. The slots <b>116</b> in the cap <b>202</b>, however, are depicted as being disposed or defined longitudinally B (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>) with respect to the cap <b>202</b>. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate, however, that the slots <b>116</b> can be defined laterally A or longitudinally B, or a combination of both, in either cap <b>104</b>, <b>202</b>, without departing from the scope of the disclosure. In other embodiments, one or more slots <b>116</b> defined in either cap <b>104</b>, <b>202</b> may be disposed at an angle offset from laterally A or longitudinally B, without departing from the scope of the disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">According to the present disclosure, the cap <b>202</b> is interchangeable with the cap <b>104</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref>, and/or various other caps having differing designs and configurations. As with the cap <b>104</b>, the cap <b>202</b> is removably attached to the body <b>106</b> such that a user or manufacturer is able to remove the cap <b>202</b> and replace it with a different cap (e.g., the cap <b>104</b>). Accordingly, either cap <b>104</b>, <b>202</b> may be interchangeably used in either knife block <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, without departing from the scope of the disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Similar to the cap <b>104</b>, in at least one embodiment, the cap <b>202</b> may be secured to the body <b>106</b> via a snap-fit engagement. More particularly, the cap <b>202</b> may be configured to be inserted a short distance into the interior <b>108</b> and may include one or more lips <b>122</b> (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>). In such an embodiment, the lips <b>122</b> extend from the cap <b>202</b> and are configured to engage a shoulder <b>124</b> (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>) defined on at least one of the inner surfaces of the body <b>106</b>. To assemble the cap <b>202</b> to the body <b>106</b>, the cap <b>202</b> may be extended into the interior <b>108</b> of the body <b>106</b>, which results in the lips <b>122</b> flexing inward. As the cap <b>202</b> progresses into the interior <b>108</b>, the lips <b>122</b> will eventually locate the shoulder <b>124</b> and flex outward and into engagement therewith, and thereby forming a snap-fit engagement. The snap-fit engagement may prove useful in allowing a user or manufacturer to reverse the assembly process to remove the cap <b>202</b> and subsequently secure a new (differently configured) cap to the body <b>106</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">While depicted in <figref>FIGS. 4-6</figref> as a snap-fit engagement, the cap <b>202</b> may equally be removably attached to the body <b>106</b> via a variety of other means including, but not limited to, mechanically fastening the cap <b>202</b> to the body <b>106</b>, an interference fit between the cap <b>202</b> to the body <b>106</b>, or a combination thereof. In such embodiments, if desired, the user or manufacturer can remove and replace the cap <b>202</b> with a new cap that exhibits a different configuration or design of the slots <b>116</b>. It should be understood that in some embodiments the cap <b>202</b> can be permanently affixed to the body <b>106</b> once the knife block is assembled to its final form.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, with continued reference to <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref> and <b>4</b>-<b>6</b>, illustrated is an embodiment of another exemplary knife block <b>300</b>, according to one or more embodiments. More particularly, <figref>FIG. 4</figref> depicts an isometric view of the knife block <b>300</b> and <figref>FIG. 8</figref> depicts an exploded view of the knife block <b>300</b>. The knife block <b>300</b> may be similar in some respects to the knife blocks <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> and therefore will be best understood with reference thereto, where like numerals will reference like elements not described again.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">As illustrated, the knife block <b>300</b> may include a base <b>302</b>, a cap <b>304</b>, and a body <b>306</b> that generally extends between the base <b>302</b> and the cap <b>304</b>. Each of the base <b>302</b>, the cap <b>304</b>, and the body <b>306</b> may be made of a variety of materials including, but not limited to, plastics, metals, composites (e.g., fiberglass, carbon fiber, etc.), ceramics, wood, and any combination thereof. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate, however, that the base <b>302</b>, the cap <b>304</b>, and the body <b>306</b> may each be made of any rigid material, without departing from the scope of the disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The base <b>302</b> may provide a surface or location where the knife block <b>300</b> may be able rest upon an opposing planar surface (i.e., a table, countertop, etc.). The base <b>302</b> may be coupled to the body <b>306</b> via a variety of fastening techniques. For example, the base <b>302</b> may be coupled to the body <b>306</b> using a snap-fit engagement, mechanical fasteners <b>326</b> (with or without washers <b>328</b>), an interference fit, adhesives, sonic welding, melding, and any combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The body <b>306</b> generally extends vertically from the base <b>302</b>, and the body <b>306</b> may define or otherwise provide an interior <b>308</b> (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>). The base <b>302</b> generally encloses the interior <b>308</b> at the bottom end of the knife block <b>300</b>, and the cap <b>304</b> generally encloses the interior <b>308</b> at the receiving end. As described herein, the blade(s) of one or more knives may be extended through the cap <b>304</b> and into the interior <b>308</b> in order to properly store or stow the knives in the knife block <b>300</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In some embodiments, the body <b>306</b> is made of a single monolithic component that defines the sides of the knife block <b>300</b> extending between the base <b>302</b> and the cap <b>304</b>. In other embodiments, however, the body <b>306</b> is made of multiple components. As illustrated, for example, the body <b>306</b> may include a faceplate <b>310</b> and a shroud <b>312</b> operatively coupled to the faceplate <b>310</b>. The faceplate <b>310</b> may be coupled or otherwise secured to the shroud <b>312</b> using a snap-fit engagement, mechanical fasteners, an interference fit, adhesives, sonic welding, melding, and any combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The cap <b>304</b> is characterized as the receiving end of the knife block <b>300</b> and includes or otherwise defines one or more slots <b>316</b> (four shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>). As depicted, the slots <b>316</b> are defined laterally A within the cap <b>304</b>, similar to the slots <b>116</b> in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. In other embodiments, however, the slots <b>316</b> may be defined longitudinally B within the cap <b>304</b>, similar to the slots <b>116</b> in <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, or a combination of laterally A and longitudinally B. Each slot <b>316</b> may extend through the cap <b>304</b> and may be configured to receive the blade of a corresponding knife to be stowed in the knife block <b>300</b>. Accordingly, the shape and width of each slot <b>316</b> may vary one from another to accommodate various sizes and shapes of knives or other cutlery utensils (e.g., knife sharpening rods).</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Referring specifically to <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, one or more of the slots <b>316</b> may have a corresponding blade sleeve <b>318</b> that extends therefrom into the interior <b>308</b> of the knife block <b>300</b>. The blade sleeves <b>318</b> exhibit substantially the same size and width as its corresponding slot <b>316</b> and extends a short distance into the interior <b>308</b>. As can be appreciated, the blade sleeves <b>318</b> may prove advantageous in providing elongate guides for knife blades extended through the slots <b>316</b> and into the interior <b>308</b>.
