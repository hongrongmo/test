The ingot manufacture apparatus according to the embodiment of the disclosure may be a continuous Czochralski type (hereinafter CCz type) ingot manufacture apparatus which can intermittently or continuously provide silicon while an ingot (IG) grows.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">A crucible <b>110</b> may include a melting zone (MZ) in which molten silicon (MS) is formed and a growth zone (GZ) in which an ingot (IG) grows from the molten silicon (MS).</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The melting zone (MZ) may be a region between the crucible <b>110</b> and an inner wall <b>120</b>. The growth zone (GZ) may be a region inside the inner wall <b>120</b>. The inner wall <b>120</b> may be provided in the crucible <b>110</b> and the molten silicon formed in the melting zone (MZ) may be drawn into the inner wall <b>120</b>. An inlet <b>125</b> may be formed in the inner wall <b>120</b> and the molten silicon (MS) may be drawn into the growth zone (GZ) from the melting zone (MZ).</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">A feeding unit <b>130</b> may be configured to introduce silicon to the crucible <b>110</b> to change the height of the molten silicon (MS) while the ingot (IG) grows. The feeding unit <b>130</b> may be a pipe or tube and the type of the feeding unit <b>130</b> may be diverse.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">A susceptor <b>140</b> may surround the crucible <b>110</b>. The silicon is melted at a high temperature such that the crucible <b>110</b> can get soft. The susceptor <b>140</b> may be configured to support the shape of the crucible <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">A heater <b>150</b> may apply heat to the crucible <b>110</b> to form the molten silicon (MS). In other words, the heater <b>150</b> may heat the crucible <b>110</b> to melt the silicon supplied from the feeding unit <b>130</b>. The heater <b>150</b> may be provided adjacent to the susceptor <b>140</b>. The heater <b>150</b> may heat the silicon approximately to <b>1420</b><i>r</i>, such that the silicon can be melted in the crucible <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">A heat shield <b>160</b> and an insulator <b>170</b> may insulate the heat emitted from the heater <b>150</b> and enhance thermal efficiency, only to protect an inner wall of the chamber <b>180</b> from a high temperature radiant heat.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">A shaft <b>190</b> may be connected to the susceptor and support the crucible <b>110</b>. Unless the susceptor <b>140</b> is provided, the shaft <b>190</b> can be directly connected to the crucible <b>110</b>. At this time, the shaft <b>190</b> is movable upward and downward to move the crucible <b>110</b>. The motion of the shaft <b>190</b> will be described in detail.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">A supply regulating unit <b>200</b> may be connected to the feeding unit <b>130</b> and the supply regulating unit <b>200</b> can regulate a supply rate of the silicon. In this instance, the supply regulating unit <b>200</b> may include a vibrator or a screw. The components of the supply regulating unit <b>200</b> are not limited thereto. The vibrator may regulate an amplitude or a frequency of vibration such that the supply rate of the silicon can be controlled. A rotation number of the screw may be regulated such that the supply rate of the silicon can be controlled.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">A hopper <b>210</b> is connected to the supply regulating unit <b>200</b> and silicon is stored in the hopper <b>210</b>. A valve <b>220</b> may be provided in a silicon supply pipe <b>230</b> to allow or stop the silicon.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">An outlet unit <b>185</b> may exhaust sweeping gas outside to remove the silicon oxide generated during the growth process of the ingot (IG). Examples of the sweeping gas may include Ar, He and N<sub>2 </sub>and not limited thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Hereinafter, an ingot manufacture method according to first to third embodiments of the disclosure will be described, referring to the accompanying drawings.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The ingot manufacture method according to the first to third embodiments may be realized by the ingot manufacture apparatus and not limited thereto. The ingot manufacture method may be realized by apparatuses including different components from the ingot manufacture apparatus shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the CCz ingot manufacture apparatus may supply silicon to the melting zone (MZ) from the feeding unit <b>130</b> while an ingot (IG) grows. Accordingly, the height (L) of the molten silicon (MS), in other words, the maximum distance from a bottom of the crucible <b>110</b> to a surface of the molten silicon (MS) can be maintained constantly during the growth of the ingot (IG).</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">At this time, since the supply rate (dM<sub>F</sub>/dt) of silicon is the same as the growth rate (dM/dt) of the ingot (IG), the height (L) of the molten silicon (MS) may be maintained constantly.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Meanwhile, a shearing stress may be applied to an inner surface of the crucible <b>110</b> along the flow of the molten silicon (MS) and the crucible <b>110</b> may be etched by the shearing stress of the molten silicon (MS). Such the strongest shearing stress may be applied to the surface of the molten silicon (MS) and too much etching may be performed between the surface of the molten silicon (MS) and an inner surface of the crucible <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">With keeping the height of the molten silicon (MS), a plurality of ingots may be manufactured. The more ingots are manufactured, the more severe etching of the crucible <b>110</b> is performed. When the etching of the crucible <b>110</b> is more severe, the shock or pressure applied to the crucible <b>110</b> may damage the crucible <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">As shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, in the ingot manufacture method according to the first embodiment, a first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) grows from the molten silicon (MS) in the crucible <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">At this time, at least of a portion of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) grows in a state where the height of the molten silicon (MS) which the crucible <b>110</b> is filled with is kept at a first level (L<b>1</b>) for a first period. The silicon may be intermittently or continuously supplied to the melting zone (MZ) for the first period.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The height of the molten silicon (MS) is changed into a second level (L<b>2</b>) different from the first level (L<b>1</b>) from the first level (L<b>1</b>) for a second period after the first period. At this time, the second level (L<b>2</b>) may be smaller or larger than the first level (L<b>1</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">The height of the molten silicon (MS) may be changed for the first period and the second period and the etching of the crucible <b>110</b> may be performed in a border area between the molten silicon (MS) at the first level (L<b>1</b>) and an inner surface of the crucible <b>110</b> and a border area between the molten silicon (MS) at the second level (L<b>2</b>) and the inner surface of the crucible <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the height of the molten silicon (MS) is kept constantly and the etching is intensively performed in a specific portion of the crucible <b>110</b>. However, in the ingot manufacture method according to the first embodiment, the height of the molten silicon (MS) is changed and positions in which the etchings are generated may be dispersed.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Accordingly, the ingot manufacture method according to the first embodiment may prevent the etching from being performed at a specific portion of the crucible <b>110</b>, such that damage to the crucible <b>110</b> may be prevented.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The change in the heights of the molten silicon (MS) may be generated during the growth process of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) or after the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) has grown.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">As shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the height of the molten silicon (MS) is changed while the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) grows and the growth of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) may be performed continuously for the second period.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">After a portion of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) grows, the growth rate of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) may be different from the supply rate of the silicon supplied to the crucible <b>110</b> for the second period. Accordingly, the height of the molten silicon (MS) may be changed into the second level (L<b>2</b>) from the first level (L<b>1</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">For instance, as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, when the growth rate (dM/dt) of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) is greater than the supply rate (dM<sub>F</sub>/dt) of the silicon, the height of the molten silicon (MS) may be lowered into the second level (L<b>2</b>) from the first level (L<b>1</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">As not shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the growth rate (dM/dt) of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) is less than the supply rate (dM<sub>F</sub>/dt) of the silicon, the height of the molten silicon (MS) may be heightened to the second level (L<b>2</b>) from the first level (L<b>1</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">As shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, when the growth of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) is completed after the growth of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) for the second period, the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) is taken out from the chamber <b>180</b> and a seed (S) for manufacturing a second ingot (IG<b>2</b>) is introduced into the chamber <b>180</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">Before the second ingot (IG<b>2</b>) starts to grow after the growth of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>), there may be no ingot growing from the molten silicon (MS). Unless the silicon supplied to the crucible <b>110</b>, the height of the molten silicon (MS) is kept at the second level (L<b>2</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">In contrast, when silicon is supplied to the crucible <b>110</b> before the second ingot (IG<b>2</b>) starts to grow after the growth of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>), the height of the molten silicon (MS) may be higher than the second level (L<b>2</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">Once the growth of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) is completed after the growth for the second period, the second ingot (IG<b>2</b>) may start to grow from the molten silicon (MS) having a third level (L<b>3</b>) which is the same as or higher than the second level (L<b>2</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">Hereinabove, it is described that the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) continuously grows for the second period after partially growing for the first period. Hereinafter, it will be described that the growth of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) is completed for the first period.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">As shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) may grow from the molten silicon (MS) having the first level (L<b>1</b>) for the first period. After the growth of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) is completed, a seed (S) for the second ingot (IG<b>2</b>) is introduced into the chamber <b>180</b> and the second ingot (IG<b>2</b>) may start to grow.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">At this time, the second ingot (IG<b>2</b>) may start to grow from the molten silicon having the height changed into the second level (L<b>2</b>) from the first level (L<b>1</b>) less than the second level (L<b>2</b>) for the second period after the growth of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) is completed for the first period. In other words, silicon is supplied to the crucible <b>110</b> before the second ingot (IG<b>2</b>) starts to grow after the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) has grown, such that the height of the molten silicon (MS) may be increased to the second level (L<b>2</b>) from the first level (L<b>1</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">As mentioned above, no ingot grows while the seed (S) is introduced after the growth of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) and the height of the molten silicon (MS) may be increased to the second level (L<b>2</b>), as silicon is supplied. The growth of the second ingot (IG<b>2</b>) may start from the molten silicon (MS) having the second level (L<b>2</b>). Accordingly, positions of the etching portions of the crucible <b>110</b> may be dispersed and the possibility of damage to the crucible <b>110</b> can be reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">In case the height of the molten silicon (MS) is kept at the second level (L<b>2</b>) during the growth of the second ingot (IG<b>2</b>), the supply rate (dM<sub>F</sub>/dt) of the silicon supplied to the crucible <b>110</b> may be substantially the same as the growth rate (dM/dt) of the second ingot (IG<b>2</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">Unlike the disclosure above, as shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the height of the molten silicon (MS) may be changed into the second level (L<b>2</b>) from the first level (L<b>1</b>) for the second period, while the second ingot (IG<b>2</b>) grows after the growth of the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) has grown for the first period.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">For instance, the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) may have grown from the molten silicon (MS) having the height of the first level (L<b>1</b>) for the first period. After that, the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) may be discharged from the chamber <b>180</b> and the seed (S) may be introduced into the chamber <b>180</b>, with keeping the height of the molten silicon (MS) at the first level (L<b>1</b>). Hence, the height of the molten silicon (MS) is changed into the second level (L<b>2</b>) from the first level (L<b>1</b>) for the second period while the second ingot (IG<b>2</b>) grows. The positions of etching portions of the crucible <b>110</b> may be dispersed through such the process.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">At this time, the growth rate (dM/dt) of the second ingot (IG<b>2</b>) for the second period may be different from the supply rate (dM<sub>F</sub>/dt) of the silicon to the crucible <b>110</b>, such that the height of the molten silicon (MS) can be changed into the second level (L<b>2</b>) from the first level (L<b>1</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">Meanwhile, a plurality of the first ingots (IG<b>1</b>) may grow from the molten silicon (MS) having the height of the first level (L<b>1</b>) for the first period. At this time, after at least a portion of the last one out of the first ingots (IG<b>1</b>) grows, the height of the molten silicon (MS) may be changed into the second level (L<b>2</b>) from the first level (L<b>1</b>) for the second period.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">For instance, when two first ingots (IG<b>1</b>) are manufactured for the first period, the last one of the two first ingots (IG<b>1</b>) partially grows and the height of the molten silicon (MS) may be then changed into the second level (L<b>2</b>) from the first level (L<b>1</b>), as shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>.</p>

After that, the second ingot (IG<b>2</b>) may grow from the molten silicon (MS) having a height changeable in a second range. Accordingly, the range of the heights of the molten silicon (MS) at which the first ingot (IG<b>1</b>) grows may be different from the range of the heights of the molten silicon (MS) at which the second ingot (IG<b>2</b>) grows, such that positions of the etching portions of the molten silicon (MS) can be dispersed in an inner surface of the crucible <b>110</b>.</p>
