  <abstract id="abstr_eng" date-changed="20150903" lang="eng" format="original">
    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">By using a phage display derived peptide as an initial template, compounds have been developed that are highly specific against Mdm2/Mdm4. These compounds exhibit greater potency in p53 activation and protein-protein interaction assays than a compound derived from the p53 wild-type sequence. Unlike nutlin, a small molecule inhibitor of Mdm2/Mdm4, the phage derived compounds can arrest cells resistant to p53 induced apoptosis over a wide concentration range without cellular toxicity, suggesting they are highly suitable for cyclotherapy.</p>

      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of priority of SG provisional application No. 201207302-9, filed Oct. 1, 2012, the contents of it being hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</p>
      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of peptides and modified peptides for binding to Mdm2/Mdm4 and activating the p53 response.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Inhibition of the p53:Mdm2 interaction is an attractive therapeutic target. Molecules able to block the interaction can activate the p53 response by blocking the two inhibitory activities of Mdm2, namely its occlusion of the N-terminal p53 transactivation domain and its targeting of p53 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Such molecules could be used to re-activate p53 function in p53 wild-type tumour cells. In a second application, called cyclotherapy, their ability to induce a reversible cell cycle arrest in normal proliferating cells can selectively protect these tissues from cytotoxic chemotherapeutics and ionizing radiation, thus enabling the treatment of p53 null or p53 mutant tumours with fewer side effects.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Several classes of molecules that inhibit this interaction have been developed (e.g. Nutlin, MI-219). They mimic the conserved residues from a section of sequence in the p53 N-terminal that are essential for the interaction with the N-terminal p53 binding domain of Mdm2. This short sequence forms an Î±-helix upon binding, which allows the three conserved residues of the Mdm2 binding motif (FXXXWXXL) to optimally embed into the hydrophobic binding groove located on the surfaces of Mdm2 and the homologous Mdm4 proteins. However, these peptides exhibit off-target toxicity to p53-null cell and are not functional in the presence of serum.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Recent studies have reported a stapled peptide (SAH-8) derived from the wild type p53 sequence that binds to Mdm2 and Mdm4 and activates the p53 response in cells. However, the wild type p53 peptide (E<sup>1</sup>TFSDLWKLLP<sup>11</sup>E of SEQ ID No: 17) has a reported low affinity for Mdm2/Mdm4 (452Â±11 nM and 646Â±26 nM, respectively) and comes from a region of p53 that is known to interact with many other proteins.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Extensive studies have used phage display to select for linear peptides that bind Mdm2 with high affinity. However, the proline at position P12 is not observed in the electron density map in the crystal structure of the Mdm2:peptide complex and is not critical for binding to Mdm 2.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">There is therefore a need to provide improved peptides or staple peptides that overcomes the disadvantages mentioned above to improve efficiency of binding to Mdm2/Mdm4 and reduce off target toxicity.</p>

The F2H assay consists of two components, a bait and a prey proteins. The bait is a fusion of p53 with a lac repressor (LacI) and GFP, whilst the prey is a fusion of either Mdm2 or Mdm4 with RFP. Upon expression in the transgenic BHK cell line, the bait localizes to a distinct section of the chromosomal DNA containing stably integrated lac operator repeats and forms a bright green spot in the nucleus. The prey protein interacts with the bait protein and co-localizes at the same spot in the nucleus and forms a red spot. Compounds which inhibit the target interaction can then be titrated on to the cells and the declined percentage of co-localization can be measured using imaging techniques. The F2H assay differs from the p53 activity assay as it does not measure reactivation of a p53 reporter gene but the precise interaction to be disrupted.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0025">Before the present peptides, nucleic acids, vectors, pharmaceutical compositions, methods and uses thereof are described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular peptides, nucleic acids, vectors, pharmaceutical compositions, methods, uses and experimental conditions described, as such peptides, methods, uses and conditions may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for purposes of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present invention will be limited only by the appended claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0026">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, as it will be understood that modifications and variations are encompassed within the spirit and scope of the instant disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0027">The invention is based, in part, on the discovery of peptides having improved pharmacological properties by using a phage display library. Advantageously, the peptide as disclosed herein is derived from a phage display library as an initial peptide, providing an experimental evidence of peptides which are potent binders against Mdm2/Mdm4, when compared to other inhibitors, such as inhibitors derived from the p53 wild-type sequences. The observations made by the inventors and disclosed herein are useful in the design of new Mdm2/Mdm4 inhibitors for therapeutic applications, for example, in the treatment of cancer.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0028">Peptidomimetics represent an alternative approach to targeting eIF4E:eIF4G interaction. Proteins in their natural state are folded into regions of secondary structure, such as helices, sheets and turns. The alpha-helix is one of the most common structural motifs found in the proteins, and many biologically important protein interactions are mediated by the interaction of a Î±-helical region of one protein with another protein. Yet, Î±-helices have a propensity for unraveling and forming random coils, which are, in most cases, biologically less active, or even inactive, have lower affinity for their target, have decreased cellular uptake and are highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0029">Thus, the peptide as described herein exhibit a greater potency in p53 activation and protein-protein interaction assays than a compound derived from the p53 wild-type sequence. Exemplary, non-limiting embodiments of the peptides and cross-linked peptides for binding to Mdm2/Mdm4 and activating p53 response. In one embodiment, there is disclosed the peptide comprising or consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 1 (TSFXaa<sub>1</sub>EYW Xaa<sub>3</sub>LLXaa<sub>2</sub>), wherein Xaa<sub>3 </sub>can be N or A and wherein in case Xaa<sub>3 </sub>is N, Xaa<sub>1 </sub>is not A and/or Xaa<sub>2 </sub>is not S. In one embodiment, Xaa<sub>3 </sub>can be any type of amino acid other than A and wherein in case Xaa<sub>3 </sub>is N, Xaa<sub>1 </sub>is not A and/or Xaa<sub>2 </sub>is not S. Those peptides have been shown to inhibit the p53:Mdm2 interactions with a nanomolar affinity as illustrated in the experimental section (see e.g. example 1 and Table 1 below).</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0030">As defined herein, the terms âpeptideâ, âproteinâ, âpolypeptideâ, and âamino acid sequenceâ are used interchangeably herein to refer to polymers of amino acid residues of any length. The polymer may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids or amino acid analogs, and it may be interrupted by chemical moieties other than amino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified naturally or by intervention; for example disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labeling or bioactive component. The term peptide encompasses two or more naturally occurring or synthetic amino acids linked by a covalent bond (e.g., a amide bond).</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0031">In the context of this specification, the term âamino acidâ is defined as having at least one primary, secondary, tertiary or quaternary amino group, and at least one acid group, wherein the acid group may be a carboxylic, sulfonic, or phosphoric acid, or mixtures thereof. The amino, groups may be âalphaâ, âbetaâ, âgammaâ . . . to âomegaâ with respect to the acid group(s). Suitable amino acids include, without limitation, both the D- and L-isomers of the 20 common naturally occurring amino acids found in peptides (e.g., A, R, N, C, D, Q, E, G, H, I, L, K, M, F, P, S, T, W, Y, V (as known by the one letter abbreviations)) as well as the naturally occurring and unnaturally occurring amino acids prepared by organic synthesis or other metabolic routes.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0032">The backbone of the âamino acidâ may be substituted with one or more groups selected from halogen, hydroxy, guanido, heterocyclic groups. Thus term âamino acidsâ also includes within its scope glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophane, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, glutamine, asparte, glutamine, lysine, arginine and histidine, taurine, betaine, N-methylalanine, etc. (L) and (D) forms of amino acids are included in the scope of this invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0033">The term âamino acid side chainâ refers to a moiety attached to the Î±-carbon in an amino acids. For example, the amino acid side chain for alanine is methyl, the amino acid side chain for phenylalanine is phenylmethyl, the amino acid side chain for cysteine is thiomethyl, the amino acid side chain for aspartate is carboxymethyl, the amino acid side chain for tyrosine is 4-hydroxyphenylmethyl, etc. Other non-naturally occurring amino acid side chains are also included, for example, those that occur in nature (e.g., an amino acid metabolite) or those that are made synthetically (e.g., an alpha di-substituted amino acid).</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0034">Thus, in one example, there is provided a peptide comprising or consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 (TSFXaa<sub>1</sub>EYWXaa<sub>3</sub>LLXaa<sub>2</sub>), wherein Xaa<sub>1</sub>, Xaa<sub>2 </sub>and Xaa<sub>3 </sub>is independently any type of amino acid and wherein the peptide is a crosslinked peptide with a cross-linker to connect a first amino acid Xaa<sub>1 </sub>to a second amino acid Xaa<sub>2</sub>. In another example, there is provided a peptide comprising or consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3 (TSFXaa<sub>1</sub>EYWXaa<sub>3</sub>LLXaa<sub>2</sub>Xaa<sub>4</sub>), wherein Xaa<sub>1</sub>, Xaa<sub>2 </sub>and Xaa<sub>3 </sub>is independently any type of amino acid and wherein Xaa<sub>4 </sub>is any type of amino acid other than P. Accordingly, for example, Xaa<sub>4 </sub>may comprise, but is not limited to, A, R, N, C, D, Q, E, G, H, I, L, K, M, F, S, T, W, Y, or V. In a further example, there is provided the peptide as described above, wherein Xaa<sub>3 </sub>is N or A and wherein in case Xaa<sub>3 </sub>is N, Xaa<sub>1 </sub>is not A and/or Xaa<sub>2 </sub>is not S.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0035">As indicated above, peptides cross-linkers predominately increase the helicity of the peptide in solution before binding but this can be compromised by non-optimal interactions at the peptide:protein interface. In the rationally designed peptides of the invention such limitations have been overcome, or at least ameliorated by optimising packing effects at the interface, stabilising the bound complex and greater helical stabilization in solution. For example, in some peptides disclosed herein, the cross-linker might only induce 45% helicity but this can be compensated for with the formation of the (hydrogen) h-bond between two amino acids and by optimal packing interactions of another amino acid of the peptide. In contrast, another exemplary peptide may lose the hydrogen bond between the two amino acids upon binding but compensation arises via greater helicity (63%) in solution and stabilisation of the helical bound form by another amino acid. This is reflected in the enthalpy and entropy values of binding derived for these two peptides with the first exemplary peptide having a more favourable enthalpic component and the second exemplary peptide having a more favourable entropic component.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0036">Many protein-protein interactions involve a contiguous section of protein that forms an interfacial Î±-helix when bound. Advantageously, this conformation can be further stabilized by a chemical method known as stapling, which consists of an all-hydrocarbon macrocyclic bridge connecting adjacent turns of the helix. Stapling peptides can increase their affinity by reducing the entropic cost of binding, increase their in vivo half-life by improving their proteolytic stability and most significantly allow their effective cellular uptake and intra-cellular activity. Thus, the present disclosure advantageously selected the peptides described above having a high affinity for Mdm2/Mdm4 to further improve their stability, protection from proteolytic cleavage and their cellular uptake, for example, by stapling.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0037">The peptides may include at least one peptide cross-linker (also called a staple or a tether) between two non-natural (i.e. unnatural or synthetic) amino acids that significantly enhance the alpha helical structure of the peptides. Generally, the cross-linker extends across the length of one or two helical turns (that is about 3.4 or about 7 amino acids). Accordingly, amino acids positioned at i and i+3 (3 amino acids apart); and i and i+4; or i and i+7 are ideal candidates for chemical modification and cross-linking.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0038">The term âcross-linkerâ or grammatical variations thereof as used herein refers to the intramolecular connection (also referred as staple) of two peptides domains (e.g., two loops of a helical peptide). When the peptide has a helical secondary structure, the cross-linker is a macrocyclic ring, which is exogenous (not part of) core or inherent (non-cross-linked) helical peptide structure. The macrocyclic ring may comprise an all-hydrocarbon linkage ring and incorporates the side chains linked to the Î±-carbon of at least two amino acids of the peptide. The size of the macrocyclic ring is determined by the number helical peptide amino acids in the ring and the number of carbon groups in the moieties connecting the Î±-carbon of the at least two amino acids of the peptide. The cross-linked peptide has at least one cross-linker. In various examples, the cross-linked peptide has 1, 2 or 3 cross linkers.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0039">A cross-linked peptide (i.e. stapled peptide) is a peptide comprising a selected number of standard (i.e. natural) or non-standard (non-natural or unnatural or synthetic) amino acids, further comprising at least two moieties capable of undergoing reaction to promote carbon-carbon bond formation, that has been contacted with a reagent to generate at least one cross-link between the at least two moieties, which modulates, for example, peptide stability. The cross-linked peptide may comprise more than one, that is multiple (two, three, four, five, six, etc.) cross-links.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0040">Any cross-linker known in the art can be used. Exemplary cross-linkers can include but are not limited to, hydrocarbon linkage, one or more of an ether, thioether, ester, amine, or amide moiety. In some cases, a naturally occurring amino acid side chain can be incorporated into the cross-linker. For example, a cross-linker can be coupled with a functional group such as the hydroxyl in serine, the thiol in cysteine, the primary amine in lysine, the acid in aspartate or glutamate, or the amide in asparagine or glutamine. Accordingly, it is possible to create a cross-link using naturally occurring amino acids rather than using a cross-linker that is made by coupling two non-naturally occurring amino acids. It is also possible to use a single non-naturally occurring amino acid together with a naturally occurring amino acid. In one example, there is provided a peptide as disclosed herein wherein the natural amino acid in the position to be cross-linked (i.e. the naturally occurring amino acid that is used to create the cross-linker) is replaced by an olefin-bearing unnatural amino acid. In a further example, the peptide as described above may comprise at least one two peptide cross linkers. Additionally, the peptide as described above is characterized by the presence of a first unnatural amino acid at the position Xaa<sub>1 </sub>wherein the unnatural amino acid side chain cross-links to the side chain of a second unnatural amino acid at position Xaa<sub>2</sub>. In one example, the cross-linker of the peptide as described herein may comprise a hydrocarbon linkage.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0041">Thus, one example of a hydrocarbon linkage is the use of an olefin. The term âolefinâ and grammatical variations thereof (also called alkene or alkenyl for a group) as used herein denotes a monovalent group derived from a straight- or branched-chain hydrocarbon moiety having at least one carbon-carbon double bond by the removal of a single hydrogen atom. The alkenyl moiety contains the indicated number of carbon atoms. For example, C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>indicates that the group may have from 2 to 10 (inclusive) carbon atoms in it. The term âlower alkenylâ refers to a C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>8 </sub>alkenyl chain. In the absence of any numerical designation, âalkenylâ is a chain (straight or branched) having 2 to 20 (inclusive) carbon atoms in it.</p>

      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0075">In some examples, there is provided an isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a peptide as disclosed herein. In addition, the present invention also provides a nucleic acid molecule encoding for a peptide serving as template for the peptide of the present invention. Since the degeneracy of the genetic code permits substitutions of certain codons by other codons which specify the same amino acid and hence give rise to the same protein, the invention is not limited to a specific nucleic acid molecule but includes all nucleic acid molecules comprising a nucleotide sequence coding for the peptides of the present invention. The peptides encoded by the nucleic acid molecule may be chemically or enzymatically modified to obtain the cross-linked peptides as described herein.</p>

A nucleic acid molecule such as DNA is regarded to be âcapable of expressing a nucleic acid molecule or a coding nucleotide sequenceâ or capable âto allow expression of a nucleotide sequenceâ if it contains regulatory nucleotide sequences which contain transcriptional and translational information and such sequences are âoperably linkedâ to nucleotide sequences which encode the polypeptide. An operable linkage is a linkage in which the regulatory DNA sequences and the DNA sequences sought to be expressed are connected in such a way as to permit gene sequence expression. The precise nature of the regulatory regions needed for gene sequence expression may vary from organism to organism, but shall, in general include a promoter region which, in prokaryotes, contains only the promoter or both the promoter which directs the initiation of RNA transcription as well as the DNA sequences which, when transcribed into RNA will signal the initiation of synthesis. Such regions will normally include non-coding regions which are located 5â² and 3â² to the nucleotide sequence to be expressed and which are involved with initiation of transcription and translation such as the TATA box, capping sequence and CAAT sequences. These regions can for example, also contain enhancer sequences or translated signal and leader sequences for targeting the produced polypeptide to a specific compartment of a host cell, which is used for producing a peptide described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0077">The nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence encoding the peptide as disclosed herein can be comprised in a vector, for example an expression vector.

This vector can also allow the introduction of another nucleic acid sequence coding for a protein to be expressed or a protein part. The expression vector preferably also contains replication sites and control sequences derived from a species compatible with the host that is used for expression. The expression vector can be based on plasmids well known to person skilled in the art such as pBR322, puC16, pBluescript and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0078">The vector containing the nucleic acid molecule can be transformed into host cells capable of expressing the genes.

      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0103">The staple was incorporated across positions 4 and 11 in MTide-01 to create the stapled derivative sMTide-01, having the amino acid SEQ ID No: 5. The Proline at position P<sup>12 </sup>was removed from the original sequence, as the computer simulations demonstrated that induction of the helix by the staple would prevent the proline from packing optimally against the Mdm4 surface. Also P12 is not observed in the electron density map in the crystal structure of the Mdm2:peptide complex and is not critical for binding to Mdm2.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0104">The mechanism responsible for the improved binding of MTide-01 in comparison to the wild type sequence was supported by simulation data. The mechanism is the optimization of an intramolecular hydrogen bond network that stabilizes its helical conformation when bound to Mdm2/Mdm4, which is principally centered on S2 and E5 (<figref>FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>). Y6 makes extensive van der Waals contacts with Mdm2/Mdm4 and also participates in a hydrogen bond network on the surface of Mdm2/4 via its hydroxyl group. The replacement of P11 with S11 allows the c-terminal of the peptide to adopt a helical structure, increasing the helicity of the peptide. This position also corresponds to where the staple is tethered in sMTide-01, thereby replacing the helical inducing property of S11. Interestingly, alanine scanning mutagenesis identified N8 as being detrimental to Mdm2/4 binding primarily through disruption of the bound helix as Asn is rarely located within solvent exposed central regions of Î±-helices. Asn 8 was also identified computationally to interfere sterically with the putative placement of the staple and as a result was replaced with the favourable Ala mutation to create the sequence termed MTide-02 and the stapled derivative sMTide-02 (<figref>FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>).</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">Example 2</heading>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0105">This example provides a comparison of the affinity of the peptides of the present invention and previously disclosed peptides for Mdm2/Mdm4. sMTide-02 yielded the most potent derivative with a K<sub>d </sub>of 34.60Â±2.03 nM against Mdm2 and a K<sub>d </sub>of 45.73Â±7.65 nM against Mdm4 (Table 1). In comparison to their unstapled counterparts, both peptides exhibited slightly weaker K<sub>d</sub>s with sMTide-01 showing an approximately 2-fold increase against Mdm2 and a 4-fold increase against Mdm4. In contrast, sMTide-02 had a negligible increase against Mdm2 whilst showing a 2-fold increase in K<sub>d </sub>against Mdm4. These results validate the hypothesis that N8 interferes with the staple and the stabilization of the helix within sMTide-01. Both peptides were then tested for biological activity (<figref>FIG. 1</figref> (<i>d</i>)). sMTide-01 displayed little activity in a T22 derived p53 reporter cell line. Surprisingly, it was discovered that sMTide-02 induced the strongest p53 transcriptional response ever seen in this assay, which has been used to screen more than 300,000 compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0106">The SAH-8 peptide was synthesized and its K<sub>d</sub>s were determined to be 126.09Â±13.59 nM and 14.03Â±1.85 nM against Mdm2 and Mdm4 respectively. In contrast to sMTide-01/02, it showed a significant preference for Mdm4. When tested in the T22 p53 reporter assay, SAH-8 had negligible activity compared to sMTide-01 and induced considerably lower levels of p53 than sMTide-02 (<figref>FIG. 1</figref><i>d</i>). Interestingly, the placement of the staple in the SAH-8 sequence caused a considerable increase in affinity of the peptide against Mdm2 and Mdm4, in contrast to the MTide based sequences (see Table 1).</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0107">The origin of this improvement in affinity for Mdm2/4 lay in the sequence used to design SAH-8, which had not been optimized to stabilize the helical form of the peptide. The staple of SAH-8 more than compensated for this by reducing the entropic cost of binding and by making additional hydrophobic contacts with the surface of Mdm2/4. However, incorporation of the I, I+7 staple into the MTide-01 and 02 sequences lead to no additional increase in affinity for Mdm2/4. This highlighted the structural and energetic intricacies of adding a staple to a peptide with pre-existing helical stabilizing interactions, and their associated effects on the affinity of the peptide for the protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0108">Other analogs of sMTide-02 were designed either by truncating the N-terminal of the stapled peptide or by introducing alternative substitutions at position 8. Truncation of sMTIDE-02 at the N-terminal attenuated the affinity of the peptide for Mdm2/4 with concomitant decreases in their activity in the T22 p53 reporter assay (<figref>FIG. 3</figref> and Table 2). Interestingly, sMTide-04, where threonine at position 1 has been removed, interacted more tightly with Mdm4 than with Mdm2. Substitution of alanine at position 8 with a variety of amino acids generated a set of stapled peptides (<figref>FIG. 3</figref> and Table 2) with a wide range of K<sub>d</sub>s that did not correlate with activity in the p53 reporter assay.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0109">For example, if isoleucine and phenylalanine were introduced at position 8, the binding of the stapled peptide to Mdm2/4 was dramatically attenuated compared to sMTide-01, but their biological activity in the p53 reporter assay was improved. These results show that the context of the sequence, within which the staple is utilized, ultimately determines its effectiveness and that there is a complex relationship between the affinity of the compound for its target protein and its biological activity. Intriguingly, the small addition of a hydroxyl, i.e. phenylalanine vs. tyrosine, (sMTide-07 and 06, respectively) had little effect on the interaction between these two peptides and Mdm2/4. However, it did diminish the ability of sMTide-07 to induce p53, compared to sMTide-06. Presumably, these types of changes influenced the ability of the stapled peptide to enter cells efficiently, either by limiting cell permeability or perhaps by causing endosomal entrapment. SAH-8, on the other hand, which interacted much more tightly than both of these molecules with Mdm2/4, was a very poor activator of p53 activity in the T22 assay (<figref>FIG. 1</figref> (<i>d</i>) and <figref>FIG. 2</figref> (<i>a</i>)). However, SAH-8 possesses a sequence that differs significantly from sMTide-02 and as a result this makes it harder to delineate the precise differences for its poor biological activity in physiochemical terms.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0110">A modification that is known to improve the potency of peptides that interact with Mdm2/4 is the addition of a Chlorine atom at the C6 position of W7. Two stapled peptide analogues of sMTide-02 were synthesized containing either the L (termed sMTide-02A) or D 0.30 (termed sMTide-02B) optical isomers of the 6-Cl modified tryptophan. The L-isomer bound Mdm2 with an improved K<sub>d </sub>of 6.76Â±2.11 nM, but its affinity for Mdm4 was significantly attenuated; this preference for Mdm2 over Mdm4 is also seen for nutlin (Table 1 and <figref>FIG. 6</figref>). The D-isomer showed negligible activity in the T22 assay, despite interacting with Mdm2 with an apparent K<sub>d </sub>of 88.16 nMÂ±7.20, indicating either poor cell permeability or an inability to disrupt the pre-existing p53:Mdm2 interactions within the cell. As with the L optical isomer, its K<sub>d </sub>with Mdm4 was attenuated (Table 1). The L isomer sMTide-02A showed a much higher fold induction of p53 transcriptional activity than the unmodified sMTide-02 in the T22 assay (<figref>FIG. 1</figref> (<i>d</i>)).</p>

      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0111">This example provides a titration of p53 activating peptides. Titrations of p53 activating compounds into the T22 assay typically produced a bell shaped curve in which high concentrations of compound produced lower levels of reporter protein as a result of cell toxicity. Remarkably, while nutlin induced a typical bell shaped curve, the two peptides showed a sigmoidal curve with a plateau over a large dose range, with much higher levels of reporter protein production, indicating that these compounds lack cell toxicity despite their ability to activate p53 function to high levels (<figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>). However, both stapled peptides at low concentrations induced less p53 activity than nutlin, indicating that the dynamics of cell entry for these molecules are different.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0112">To further investigate the mechanism of action of the stapled peptides in live cells, a fully reversible cellular protein-protein interaction assay was used. The Fluorescent 2-Hybrid (F2H) assay (ChromoTek GmbH) is a microscopy-assisted method developed to analyze the disruption of the p53 interaction with either Mdm2 or Mdm4 within the nucleus of BHK cells (<figref>FIGS. 2</figref><i>b </i>and <b>2</b><i>c</i>). sMTide-02 and sMTide-02A were both shown to dissociate Mdm2 from p53 with the former showing greater potency against Mdm4. Interestingly, the SAH-8 peptide showed poor activity in this assay and limited ability to inhibit either Mdm2/4. The selectivity of nutlin towards Mdm2 was exquisitely demonstrated by the F2H assay. Live cell observations revealed, that both the stapled peptides and nutlin dissociated Mdm2/Mdm4 from p53 within 60 minutes (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0113">The low activity of SAH-8 in the protein interaction assay and the T22 assay prompted the examination of the precise conditions used to measure the biological activity of stapled peptides. In previous studies, serum was removed from the media prior to addition of SAH-8 to cells, while the inventors' studies were conducted in the presence of fetal calf serum. The effect of serum on the activity of the stapled peptides was dramatic, with sMTide-02A, sMTide-02 and SAH-8 showing significantly improved potency in the absence of serum (<figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>d</i>). However, the F2H assay showed a much smaller difference in the ability of the compounds to disrupt the complexes of Mdm2/4 with p53 in the presence or absence of serum, suggesting that serum removal sensitizes the p53 pathway to stimuli rather than limit peptide entry into cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0114">To further probe the mechanism of action of the stapled peptides, HCT-116 p53+/+ cells were pre-treated with the PGP inhibitor PSC-883, a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine A analogue. The titration of sMTide-02 with PSC-883 in the reporter assay significantly improved the sensitivity of the p53 response (<figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>e</i>), but the titration with nutlin yielded no such improvement (<figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>f</i>). Interestingly, the toxicity observed when nutlin is titrated alone (the decrease in p53 dependent reporter gene product due to cell death) occurred at lower concentrations in the presence of PSC-883. Inhibition of the PGP efflux pump therefore seemed to be potentiating the presumed p53 independent cellular toxicity of nutlin, whilst having no effect on p53 induction, as this is already efficiently activated.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0115">The effects of nutlin and the improved specificity of sMTide-02/02A were further studied in isogenic cell lines, that were either wild-type or null for p53 (<figref>FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>). sMTide-02 and sMTide-02A caused no significant decrease in the viability of either HCT-116 p53+/+ or HCT-116 p53â/â cells, and induced negligible caspase 3/7 activity. Nutlin, and surprisingly SAH-8, exhibited distinctly different characteristics to the sMTide-02/02A peptides, with both compounds decreasing cell viability at high concentrations in both cell lines. Interestingly, nutlin induced caspase 3/7 activity in the two cell lines tested, with higher fold levels observed in HCT-116 p53+/+ cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0116">Analysis of the cell cycle distribution of cells possessing wild type p53 indicated that the sMTide-02/02A peptides caused G<sub>2 </sub>arrest at both low (<figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>) and high concentrations (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>), whilst nutlin at low concentrations also caused G<sub>2 </sub>arrest (<figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>) but at higher concentrations caused substantial cell death. SAH-8 stabilizes p53 at much higher concentrations than nutlin and sMTide-02/02A. This correlates with the observed decreases in cellular viability for the p53 wild type and null cells (<figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>). These results indicate that (a) sMTide-02 and sMTide-02A induce a specific p53 response when they inhibit Mdm2/4 repression in HCT-116 p53+/+ cells but do not cause the cells to undergo p53 dependent apoptosis; (b) nutlin, at high concentrations, induces apoptosis in a p53 independent manner indicating an off target effect; (c) SAH-8 causes substantial cell death, irrespective of the presence of the wild type p53 gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0117">To ensure that the sMTide-02/02A peptides could still induce apoptosis, they were titrated into the SJSA-1 cell line, which are sensitive to p53-dependent cell death. Both peptides induced caspase 3/7 activity at substantially higher concentrations than nutlin, which suggests that the off-target effect of nutlin plays a role in the efficient induction of apoptosis in SJSA-1 cells (<figref>FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>). Primary thymocytes are also known to be sensitive to p53 dependent radiation induced apoptosis. Thymocytes were isolated from p53 wild-type and p53 deficient mice and then treated with nutlin or the sMTide-02/02A peptides. In this assay, the two peptides induced cell death in a p53-dependent manner. Notably, high doses of nutlin, and to a certain extent sMTide-02A, caused apoptosis in p53 null thymocytes, but sMTide-02 did not. This indicates an extraordinary degree of p53 dependent specificity (<figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>d</i>), confirming that in this cell type, at least, p53 activation is sufficient to induce cell death.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0118">These results suggest that when p53 is activated by inhibition of Mdm2 repression, an additional cellular signal is often required to induce efficient apoptosis of cells. With Nutlin, the signal that causes the larger increase of caspase 3/7 activity in cells possessing wild-type p53 may reside in the non-specific effects observed in the cells null for p53. Indeed, nutlin has been reported to interact with the BCL protein family. Such a mechanism implies that, for p53 reactivation to be a suitable therapy for cancer, an additional treatment (e.g. inhibition of proteins like MCL-1, BCL-2, ATM or MET) may be needed. Compared to sMTide-02/02A, SAH-8 leads to cell death in both isogenic HCT-116 cell lines, demonstrating the difference in origin of their respective peptide sequences. The p53 sequence, from which SAH-8 is derived, is also known to interact with other proteins (e.g. p300, TAFIIb) including Mdm2/4, which may explain the p53 independent cell death phenotype in p53 null cells and its toxicity to p53 wild-type cells. In contrast, the phage derived MTide sequence was selected to interact specifically with Mdm2/4 and also only encompasses the length of sequence required for binding to Mdm2/4.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0119">The data presented validates stapled peptides as a new class of macrocyclic compounds, which are capable of interacting with intracellular targets with high affinity. The phage derived sMTide-02/02A compounds are more specific and potent in their mode of biological action than SAH-8, an existing peptide. These properties make the sMTide-02/02A peptides highly suitable for validating drug targets and even in parsing well understood small molecule therapies into specific and non-specific contributions. sMTide-02/02A are also suitable candidates for dual therapy treatments, in conjunction with, for example, an apoptosis promoting compound, and may be very useful in cyclotherapy approaches, where cellular arrest with low toxicity is required.</p>

BL21 DE3 competent bacteria were then transformed with the GST tagged (1-125) Mdm2 and Mdm4 fusion constructs. The cells expressing the GST fusion constructs were grown in LB medium at 37Â° C. to an OD600 of Ë0.6 and induction was started with 1 mM IPTG and carried out overnight at room temperature. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the cell pellets were re-suspended in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10% sucrose and were then sonicated. The sonicated sample was centrifuged for 60 mins at 17,000 g at 4Â° C. The supernatant was applied to a 5 ml FF GST column (Amersham) pre-equilibrated in wash buffer (Phosphate Buffered Saline, 2.7 mM KCL and 137 mM NaCL, pH 7.4) with 1 mM DTT. The column was then further washed by 6 volumes of wash buffer. Mdm2 and Mdm4 were then purified from the column by cleavage with Precission (GE Lifesciences) protease. 10 units of precission protease, in one column volume of PBS with 1 mM DTT buffer, were injected onto the column. The cleavage reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 4Â° C. The cleaved protein was then eluted of the column with wash buffer. Protein fractions were analyzed with SDS page gel and concentrated using a Centricon (3.5 kDa MWCO) concentrator, Millipore. Mdm2 and Mdm4 protein samples were then dialyzed into a buffer solution containing 20 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 0.05M NaCl with 1 mM DTT and loaded onto a monoS column pre-equilibrated in buffer A (20 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 1 mM DTT). The column was then washed in 6 column volumes of buffer A and bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 1M NaCL over 25 column volumes.

      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0129">Apparent K<sub>d </sub>values were determined for a variety of molecules via competitive fluorescence anisotropy experiments. Titrations were carried out with the respective concentrations of Mdm2 and Mdm4 held constant at 250 nM and 75 nM, respectively and the labelled peptide at 50 nM. The competing molecules were then titrated against complex of the FAM labelled peptide and protein. Apparent K<sub>d </sub>values were determined by fitting the experimental data to the equations shown below:</p>

K<sub>d1 </sub>is the apparent K<sub>d </sub>for the labelled peptide used in the respective experiment, which has been experimentally determined as described in the previous paragraph. The FAM-labelled peptide were dissolved in DMSO at 1 mM and diluted into experimental buffer. Readings were carried out with a Envision Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer). Experiments were carried out in PBS (2.7 mM KCl, 137 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4 </sub>and 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>(pH 7.4)) and 0.1% Tween 20 buffer.

      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0131">F2H Co-Localization Assay</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0132">The F2H assay is an intracellular, fully reversible protein-protein interaction assay. This microscopy-assisted assay consists of two components, a bait and a prey protein. The bait is a fusion of p53 (1-81) with a lac repressor binding domain (LacI) and GFP, whilst the prey is a fusion of either Mdm2 (7-134) or Mdm4 (1-129) with RFP. Upon expression in a transgenic BHK cell line containing lac operator repeats, the bait protein is captured at these repeats and forms a bright green spot in the nucleus. The prey protein interacts with the bait protein and localizes to the same spot in the cells. Compounds which inhibit the target interaction can then be titrated onto the cells and the declined percentage of co-localization is measured using imaging techniques. For testing the stapled peptides, BHK cells were co-transfected with the bait p53 and prey Mdm2/4 plasmids overnight in 96 multiwell plates (Î¼Clear Greiner Bio-One, Germany). The Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) reverse transfection protocol was applied according to manufacturer's instructions with 0.2 Î¼g DNA and 0.4 Î¼l Lipofectamine 2000 per well. Cells were incubated with a 2-fold dilution series of the relevant compounds from 50 to 1.5 Î¼M in media with or without 10% FCS for 8 hours. Interaction (%) was determined as the ratio of cells showing co-localization of fluorescent signals at the nuclear spot to the total number of evaluated cells using an INCell Analyzer 1000 with a 20Ã objective (GE Healthcare). At least 100 co-transfected cells were analyzed per well. 2-fold titrations were carried out independently three times.</p>
