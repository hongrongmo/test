      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms âa,â âand,â and âtheâ include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to âa Cel6 enzymeâ includes a plurality of such enzymes and reference to âthe proteinâ includes reference to one or more proteins, and so forth.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Also, the use of âorâ means âand/orâ unless stated otherwise. Similarly, âcomprise,â âcomprises,â âcomprisingâ âinclude,â âincludes,â and âincludingâ are interchangeable and not intended to be limiting.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">It is to be further understood that where descriptions of various embodiments use the term âcomprising,â those skilled in the art would understand that in some specific instances, an embodiment can be alternatively described using language âconsisting essentially ofâ or âconsisting of.â</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice of the disclosed methods and compositions, the exemplary methods, devices and materials are described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. Thus, as used throughout the instant application, the following terms shall have the following meanings.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Cellulose is the main structural component of most plant cell walls, making it the most abundant biopolymer on earth. Cellulose is a polysaccharide composed of glucosyl units linked together by Î²-1,4 glycosidic bonds. The Î²-linkage ensures that the subunits rotate 180Â° every two glucose subunits along the cellulose chain. The rotation makes the cellulose chains straight and highly symmetrical. X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance studies have shown that cellulose chains form extensive intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups and the oxygen in the pyranose ring, producing crystalline elementary fibrils with strong tensile strength and low accessibility. The extensive hydrogen bonding makes cellulose a very recalcitrant material, with a half-life of over four million years from spontaneous hydrolysis at 25Â° C. Despite this recalcitrance, nature has provided several enzyme solutions capable of hydrolyzing cellulose into a form that can be utilized by microorganisms as a source of carbon and energy.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Recent studies have documented the superior performance of cellulases from thermophilic fungi relative to their mesophilic counterparts in laboratory scale biomass conversion processes, where enhanced stability leads to retention of activity over longer periods of time at both moderate and elevated temperatures. Fungal cellulases are attractive because they are highly active and can be expressed in fungal hosts such as <i>Hypocrea jecorina </i>(anamorph <i>Trichoderma reesei</i>) at levels up to 40 g/L in the supernatant. Unfortunately, the set of documented thermostable fungal cellulases is small. In the case of the processive cellobiohydrolase class II (CBH II) enzymes, fewer than 10 natural thermostable gene sequences are annotated in the CAZy database.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Fungal cellulases are important in industrial applications, from cotton softening in the textile industries to biofuel production in biorefineries. Specifically, cellulases are used in biorefineries to break down cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars, from which biofuels and higher-value chemicals can be derived. For cellulosic biomass to become a feasible feedstock for transportation fuels and chemicals, the cost of production needs to be competitive with the current technology of producing them from fossil fuels. Thermostable cellulases are particularly interesting for biomass degradation for several reasons. Thermostable cellulases tend to be more stable during production, storage and over a range of temperatures and operating conditions. Thermostable enzymes are more resilient towards relatively harsh industrial treatments and conditions. They also can be used to hydrolyze cellulose at higher temperatures, where the enzymes can access the substrate and catalyze their reactions at a higher rateâassuming that the reaction temperature is lower than the denaturing temperature for the enzyme. The risk of contamination by microorganisms is also reduced at elevated temperatures, as is the viscosity of hydrolysis mixtures, which lowers process costs.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The mesophilic fungus <i>Hypocrea jecorina </i>(anamorph <i>Trichoderma reesei</i>) secretes an array of cellulose enzymes that work synergistically to degrade the cellulose to smaller oligomers and eventually to glucose. This fungus' collection of cellulases includes at least five endoglucanases (EGI-V), two cellobiohydrolases (Cel6a, Cel7a), Î²-glucosidases, and hemicellulases. In <i>Hypocrea jecorina</i>, cellobiohydrolase Cel7a, Cel6a, and EGII comprise 60Â±5%, 20Â±6%, and 12Â±3% of total cellulase protein, respectively. All three cellulases consist of a cellulose-binding domain (CBD) and a catalytic domain connected by a glycosylated peptide linker. Cellobiose is the primary product of cellulose hydrolysis by cellobiohydrolases Cel6a and Cel7a.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Recently, the creation of a collection of thermostable Family 6 fungal cellobiohydrolases (Cel6) using structure-guided SCHEMA recombination was reported. The genes encoding the Cel6a from <i>Humicola insolens, Hypocrea jecorina</i>, and <i>Chaetomium thermophilum </i>were divided into eight blocks and recombined to create new, chimeric Cel6a enzymes. The block boundaries were identified using computational tools that allowed the number of disrupted side-chain contacts to be minimized, relative to the average number of mutations in the resulting chimeric proteins. Based on activity and stability data obtained from the enzymes encoded by the 48 genes that were sampled (from the 6,561 possible chimeric sequences), linear regression models were built to determine how each sequence block contributes to the thermostability of a chimeric Cel6a enzyme. The four stabilizing blocks were introduced in the cellobiohydrolase of <i>H. jecorina </i>to create the âHJPlusâ chimera 12222332 (described in US Patent Publication No. 2010/0304464-A1, incorporated herein by reference), which is stable for more than 12 hours at 63Â° C. and is also secreted at relatively high levels in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. In this disclosure, HJPlus was used as the platform for further protein engineering efforts to improve the enzyme properties relevant to optimizing cellulose hydrolysis, most notably thermostability, substrate binding, and cellulose activity. Further improving the thermostability of HJPlus not only pushes the limit of enzyme stability but also allows the discovery of mutations that might not have appeared at lower temperatures because they are not beneficial at lower temperatures. The disclosure also provides a method that allows high throughput screening on microcrystalline cellulose, Avicel, to identify useful mutations.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The disclosure provides modified Family 6 cellulases (Cel6a) that exhibit enhanced activity, thermostability, substrate binding, and/or expression in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. The disclosure also provides genetic constructs that encode the modified Cel6a enzymes and the methods for mutating, deriving, and producing the modified Cel6a enzymes from yeast and fungal expression strains. The disclosure also provides use of the modified Cel6a enzymes in the hydrolysis of cellulose or cellulosic biomass and the production of biofuels from fermentable sugars and alcohols, as well as other industrial applications of cellulases.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">As will be described in more detail below, the disclosure is based, at least in part, on the generation and expression of novel enzymes that catalyze the degredation of cellulose. In one embodiment, novel polypeptides that have been engineered/modified to degrade cellulose are provided. Such polypeptides include Cel6a variants that have been altered to include amino acid substitutions at specified residues as well as properties that include increased thermostability compared to wild-type Cel6a enzymes.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">While these variants will be described in more detail below, it is understood that polypeptides of the disclosure contain one or more modified amino acids. The presence of modified amino acids are advantageous in, for example, (a) increasing polypeptide in vivo half-life, activity or thermostability, (b) reducing or increasing polypeptide antigenicity, and (c) increasing polypeptide storage stability. Amino acid(s) are modified, for example, co-translationally or post-translationally during recombinant production (e.g., N-linked glycosylation at N--X--S/T motifs during expression in mammalian cells) or modified by synthetic means. Accordingly, A âmutantâ, âvariantâ or âmodifiedâ protein, polypeptide, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell, means a protein, polypeptide, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell, that has been altered or derived, or is in some way different or changed, from a parent protein, polypeptide, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell. A mutant or modified protein or enzyme is usually, although not necessarily, expressed from a mutant polynucleotide or gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">âConservative amino acid substitutionâ or, simply, âconservative variationsâ of a particular sequence refers to the replacement of one amino acid, or series of amino acids, with essentially identical amino acid sequences. One of skill will recognize that individual substitutions, deletions or additions which alter, add or delete a single amino acid or a percentage of amino acids in an encoded sequence result in âconservative variationsâ where the alterations result in the deletion of an amino acid, addition of an amino acid, or substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. For example, one conservative substitution group includes Alanine (A), Serine (S), and Threonine (T). Another conservative substitution group includes Aspartic acid (D) and Glutamic acid (E). Another conservative substitution group includes Asparagine (N) and Glutamine (Q). Yet another conservative substitution group includes Arginine (R) and Lysine (K). Another conservative substitution group includes Isoleucine, (I) Leucine (L), Methionine (M), and Valine (V). Another conservative substitution group includes Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), and Tryptophan (W).</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Thus, âconservative amino acid substitutionsâ of a listed polypeptide sequence of the disclosure include substitutions of a percentage, typically less than 10%, of the amino acids of the polypeptide sequence, with a conservatively selected amino acid of the same conservative substitution group. Accordingly, a conservatively substituted variation of a polypeptide of the invention can contain 100, 75, 50, 25, or 10 substitutions with a conservatively substituted variation of the same conservative substitution group.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">It is understood that the addition of sequences which do not alter the encoded activity of a nucleic acid molecule, such as the addition of a non-functional or non-coding sequence, is a conservative variation of the basic nucleic acid. The âactivityâ of an enzyme is a measure of its ability to catalyze a reaction, i.e., to âfunctionâ, and may be expressed as the rate at which the product of the reaction is produced. For example, enzyme activity can be represented as the amount of product produced per unit of time or per unit of enzyme (e.g., concentration or weight), or in terms of affinity or dissociation constants. As used interchangeably herein a âCel6a activityâ, âbiological activity of Cel6aâ or âfunctional activity of Cel6aâ, refers to an activity exerted by a Cel6a, Cel6a polypeptide, or a polypeptide having Cel6a activity on a Cel6a polypeptide substrate, as determined in vitro, according to standard techniques (as described below). Such Cel6a activity can be characterized as the rate of breakdown of cellulose or other organic polymeric sugar composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">âConservative variantsâ are proteins or enzymes in which a given amino acid residue has been changed without altering overall conformation and function of the protein or enzyme, including, but not limited to, replacement of an amino acid with one having similar properties, including polar or non-polar character, size, shape and charge. Amino acids other than those indicated as conserved may differ in a protein or enzyme so that the percent protein or amino acid sequence similarity between any two proteins of similar function may vary and can be, for example, at least 30%, at least 50%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98% or at least 99%, as determined according to an alignment scheme. As referred to herein, âsequence similarityâ means the extent to which nucleotide or protein sequences are related. The extent of similarity between two sequences can be based on percent sequence identity and/or conservation. âSequence identityâ herein means the extent to which two nucleotide or amino acid sequences are invariant. âSequence alignmentâ means the process of lining up two or more sequences to achieve maximal levels of identity (and, in the case of amino acid sequences, conservation) for the purpose of assessing the degree of similarity. Numerous methods for aligning sequences and assessing similarity/identity are known in the art such as, for example, the Cluster Method, wherein similarity is based on the MEGALIGN algorithm, as well as BLASTN, BLASTP, and FASTA (Lipman and Pearson, 1985; Pearson and Lipman, 1988). When using all of these programs, the preferred settings are those that results in the highest sequence similarity. For example, an commonly used on-line algorithm can be found at http:(//)web.expasy.org/sim/ and the default parameters used (e.g., gap open penalty of 12, gap extension penalty of 4 and the comparison Matrix being BLOSUM62). Using the immediately foregoing algorithm âSIMâ (Huang et al., Advances in Applied Mathematics, vol. 12 (1991), pp. 337-357), the percent identity between SEQ ID NO:2 and SEQ ID NO:6 is 67.7%.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Non-conservative modifications of a particular polypeptide are those which substitute any amino acid not characterized as a conservative substitution. For example, any substitution which crosses the bounds of the six groups set forth above. These include substitutions of basic or acidic amino acids for neutral amino acids, (e.g., Asp, Glu, Asn, or Gln for Val, Ile, Leu or Met), aromatic amino acid for basic or acidic amino acids (e.g., Phe, Tyr or Trp for Asp, Asn, Glu or Gln) or any other substitution not replacing an amino acid with a like amino acid. Basic side chains include lysine (K), arginine (R), histidine (H); acidic side chains include aspartic acid (D), glutamic acid (E); uncharged polar side chains include glycine (G), asparagine (N), glutamine (Q), serine (S), threonine (T), tyrosine (Y), cysteine (C); nonpolar side chains include alanine (A), valine (V), leucine (L), isoleucine (I), proline (P), phenylalanine (F), methionine (M), tryptophan (W); beta-branched side chains include threonine (T), valine (V), isoleucine (I); aromatic side chains include tyrosine (Y), phenylalanine (F), tryptophan (W), histidine (H).</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Accordingly, some amino acid residues at specific positions in a polypeptide are âexcludedâ from conservative amino acid substitutions. Instead, these restricted or âspecificâ amino acids are generally chosen from a particular group of amino acids or a specific amino acid to be substituted at that position. These amino acid residues can be substituted at a designated position to obtain a modified or variant polypeptide. While some overlap may occur, the members substituted at these specific positions are not âconservative amino acid substitutionsâ as defined above. In general, these mutations represent non-conservative substitutions at the indicated position in the designated sequence. For example, as described more fully below the substitution at position 14 of, e.g., SEQ ID NO:2 (see <figref>FIG. 1</figref>), replaces Asn or Gly with Ser. This substitution is generally not considered a âconservativeâ substitution. Similar substitutions are made throughout the various sequences at the indicated positions in order to modify the activity of the polypeptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">A âmutationâ means any process or mechanism resulting in a mutant protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell. This includes any mutation in which a protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, or gene sequence is altered, and any detectable change in a cell arising from such a mutation. Typically, a mutation occurs in a polynucleotide or gene sequence, by point mutations, deletions, or insertions of single or multiple nucleotide residues. A mutation includes polynucleotide alterations arising within a protein-encoding region of a gene as well as alterations in regions outside of a protein-encoding sequence, such as, but not limited to, regulatory or promoter sequences. A mutation in a gene can be âsilentâ, i.e., not reflected in an amino acid alteration upon expression, leading to a âsequence-conservativeâ variant of the gene. This generally arises when one amino acid corresponds to more than one codon.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">A âparentâ protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell, is any protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell, from which any other protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell, is derived or made, using any methods, tools or techniques, and whether or not the parent is itself native or mutant. A parent polynucleotide or gene encodes for a parent protein or enzyme. Exemplary parent polynucleotides and polypeptides include, for example, SEQ ID NO:3, 5, and 7 and SEQ ID NO: 4, 6, and 8, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">A âproteinâ or âpolypeptideâ, which terms are used interchangeably herein, comprises one or more chains of chemical building blocks called amino acids that are linked together by chemical bonds called peptide bonds. An âenzymeâ means any substance, composed wholly or largely of protein, that catalyzes or promotes, more or less specifically, one or more chemical or biochemical reactions. A ânativeâ or âwild-typeâ protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell, means a protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell that occurs in nature. In some embodiments of the disclosure proteins or protein sequences are presented that are not fully ânativeâ. For example, in certain aspect of the disclosure the catalytic domains of the respective enzymes are native, but they further comprise a cellulose binding domain and linker from <i>H. jecorina</i>, which results in a protein that is not native to, for example, <i>H. insolens </i>and <i>C. thermophilum. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">A polynucleotide, polypeptide, or other component is âisolatedâ when it is partially or completely separated from components with which it is normally associated (other proteins, nucleic acids, cells, synthetic reagents, etc.). A nucleic acid or polypeptide is ârecombinantâ when it is artificial or engineered, or derived from an artificial or engineered protein or nucleic acid. For example, a polynucleotide that is inserted into a vector or any other heterologous location, e.g., in a genome of a recombinant organism, such that it is not associated with nucleotide sequences that normally flank the polynucleotide as it is found in nature is a recombinant polynucleotide. A protein expressed in vitro or in vivo from a recombinant polynucleotide is an example of a recombinant polypeptide. Likewise, a polynucleotide sequence that does not appear in nature, for example a variant of a naturally occurring gene, is recombinant. For example, an âisolatedâ nucleic acid molecule is one which is separated from other nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid. For example, with regards to genomic DNA, the term âisolatedâ includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from the chromosome with which the genomic DNA is naturally associated. Typically, an âisolatedâ nucleic acid is free of sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5â² and 3â² ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb or 0.1 kb of nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. Moreover, an âisolatedâ nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">âSequence identityâ herein means the extent to which two nucleotide or amino acid sequences are invariant. âSequence alignmentâ means the process of lining up two or more sequences to achieve maximal levels of identity (and, in the case of amino acid sequences, conservation) for the purpose of assessing the degree of similarity. Numerous methods for aligning sequences and assessing similarity/identity are known in the art such as, for example, the Cluster Method, wherein similarity is based on the MEGALIGN algorithm, as well as BLASTN, BLASTP, and FASTA (Lipman and Pearson, 1985; Pearson and Lipman, 1988). When using all of these programs, the preferred settings are those that results in the highest sequence similarity. For example, the âidentityâ or âpercent identityâ with respect to a particular pair of aligned amino acid sequences can refer to the percent amino acid sequence identity that is obtained by ClustalW analysis (version W 1.8 available from European Bioinformatics Institute, Cambridge, UK), counting the number of identical matches in the alignment and dividing such number of identical matches by the greater of (i) the length of the aligned sequences, and (ii) 96, and using the following default ClustalW parameters to achieve slow/accurate pairwise alignmentsâGap Open Penalty: 10; Gap Extension Penalty: 0.10; Protein weight matrix: Gonnet series; DNA weight matrix: IUB; Toggle Slow/Fast pairwise alignments=SLOW or FULL Alignment.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Two sequences are âoptimally alignedâ when they are aligned for similarity scoring using a defined amino acid substitution matrix (e.g., BLOSUM62), gap existence penalty and gap extension penalty so as to arrive at the highest score possible for that pair of sequences. Amino acid substitution matrices and their use in quantifying the similarity between two sequences are well-known in the art and described, e.g., in Dayhoff et al. (1978) âA model of evolutionary change in proteinsâ in âAtlas of Protein Sequence and Structure,â Vol. 5, Suppl. 3 (ed. M. 0. Dayhoff), pp. 345-352. Natl. Biomed. Res. Found., Washington, D.C. and Henikoff et al. (1992) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 10915-10919 (each of which is incorporated by reference). The BLOSUM62 matrix (<figref>FIG. 10</figref>) is often used as a default scoring substitution matrix in sequence alignment protocols such as Gapped BLAST 2.0. The gap existence penalty is imposed for the introduction of a single amino acid gap in one of the aligned sequences, and the gap extension penalty is imposed for each additional empty amino acid position inserted into an already opened gap. The alignment is defined by the amino acids positions of each sequence at which the alignment begins and ends, and optionally by the insertion of a gap or multiple gaps in one or both sequences so as to arrive at the highest possible score. While optimal alignment and scoring can be accomplished manually, the process is facilitated by the use of a computer-implemented alignment algorithm, e.g., gapped BLAST 2.0, described in Altschul et al. (1997) Nucl. Acids Res. 25: 3389-3402 (incorporated by reference herein), and made available to the public at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Optimal alignments, including multiple alignments, can be prepared using, e.g., PSI-BLAST, available through the NCB1 website and described by Altschul et al. (1997) Nucl. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402 (incorporated by reference herein).</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">With respect to an amino acid sequence that is optimally aligned with a reference sequence, an amino acid residue âcorresponds toâ the position in the reference sequence with which the residue is paired in the alignment. The âpositionâ is denoted by a number that sequentially identifies each amino acid in the reference sequence based on its position relative to the N-terminus. For example, in SEQ ID NO:2, position 14 is N, position 15 is W, position 16 is S, etc. When a test sequence is optimally aligned with SEQ ID NO:2, a residue in the test sequence that aligns with the W at position 16 is said to âcorrespond to position 16â of SEQ ID NO:2. Owing to deletions, insertion, truncations, fusions, etc., that must be taken into account when determining an optimal alignment, in general the amino acid residue number in a test sequence as determined by simply counting from the N-terminal will not necessarily be the same as the number of its corresponding position in the reference sequence. For example, in a case where there is a deletion in an aligned test sequence, there will be no amino acid that corresponds to a position in the reference sequence at the site of deletion. Where there is an insertion in an aligned reference sequence, that insertion will not correspond to any amino acid position in the reference sequence. In the case of truncations or fusions there can be stretches of amino acids in either the reference or aligned sequence that do not correspond to any amino acid in the corresponding sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">By âcellulase activityâ means an enzyme that is capable of hydrolyzing cellulose. Cellulase refers to a class of enzymes produced by fungi, bacteria, and protozoans that catalyze the hydrolysis of cellulose. However, there are also cellulases produced by other types of organisms such as plants and animals. The EC number for this group of enzymes is EC 3.2.1.4. There are five general types of cellulases based on the type of reaction catalyzed: endo-cellulase; exo-cellulase, within this category there are two main types of exo-cellulases (or cellobiohydrolases, abbreviate CBH)âone type working processively from the reducing end, and one type working processively from the non-reducing end of cellulose; cellobiase or beta-glucosidase hydrolyses; oxidative cellulases; and cellulose phosphorylases that depolymerize cellulose using phosphates instead of water. Most fungal cellulases have two-domains: a catalytic domain and a cellulose binding domain that are connected by a flexible linker. In specific embodiments of the disclosure the cellulase activity is a Cel6a activity. The sequences described herein include, in some instances, both the cellulose binding domain and the catalytic domain or just the catalytic domain.

      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">The variants identified herein can also be used to generate chimeric cellobiohydrolases. For example, SCHEMA has been used previously to create families of hundreds of active Î²-lactamase and cytochrome P450 enzyme chimeras. SCHEMA uses protein structure data to define boundaries of contiguous amino acid âblocksâ which minimize &lt;E&gt;, the library average number of amino acid sidechain contacts that are broken when the blocks are swapped among different parents. It has been shown that the probability that a Î²-lactamase chimera was folded and active was inversely related to the value of E for that sequence. The RASPP (Recombination as Shortest Path Problem) algorithm was used to identify the block boundaries that minimized &lt;E&gt; relative to the library average number of mutations, &lt;m&gt;. More than 20% of the Ë500 unique chimeras characterized from a Î²-lactamase collection comprised of 8 blocks from 3 parents (3<sup>8</sup>=6,561 possible sequences) were catalytically active. A similar approach produced a 3-parent, 8-block cytochrome P450 chimera family containing more than 2,300 novel, catalytically active enzymes. Chimeras from these two collections were characterized by high numbers of mutations, 66 and 72 amino acids on average from the closest parent, respectively. SCHEMA/RASPP thus enabled design of chimera families having significant sequence diversity and an appreciable fraction of functional members.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">It has also been shown that the thermostabilities of SCHEMA chimeras can be predicted based on sequence-stability data from a small sample of the sequences. Linear regression modeling of thermal inactivation data for 184 cytochrome P450 chimeras showed that SCHEMA blocks made additive contributions to thermostability. More than 300 chimeras were predicted to be thermostable by this model, and all 44 that were tested were more stable than the most stable parent. It was estimated that as few as 35 thermostability measurements could be used to predict the most thermostable chimeras. Furthermore, the thermostable P450 chimeras displayed unique activity and specificity profiles, demonstrating that chimeragenesis can lead to additional useful enzyme properties. Here SCHEMA recombination of CBH II enzymes can generate chimeric cellulases that are active on phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) at high temperatures, over extended periods of time, and broad ranges of pH.</p>

No. 12/024,515, filed Feb. 1, 2008; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/027,885, filed Feb. 7, 2008; such references incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">In other embodiments, the thermostable enzymes described above can be operably linked to a cellulose binding domain (CBD) such as the CBD-linker polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO:10. âFused,â âoperably linked,â and âoperably associatedâ are used interchangeably herein to broadly refer to a chemical or physical coupling of two otherwise distinct domains or peptide segments, wherein each domain or peptide segment when operably linked can provide a functional polypeptide having a desired activity. Domains or peptide segments can be connected through peptide linkers such that they are functional or can be fused through other intermediates or chemical bonds. For example, two domains can be part of the same coding sequence, wherein the polynucleotides are in frame such that the polynucleotide when transcribed encodes a single mRNA that when translated comprises both domains as a single polypeptide. Alternatively, both domains can be separately expressed as individual polypeptides and fused to one another using chemical methods. Typically, the coding domains will be linked âin-frameâ either directly of separated by a peptide linker and encoded by a single polynucleotide. Various coding sequences for peptide linkers and peptide are known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">In some embodiments, a polypeptide of the disclosure comprise a substantially pure polypeptide. A âsubstantially pure polypeptideâ refers to a composition in which the polypeptide species is the predominant species present (i.e., on a molar or weight basis it is more abundant than any other individual macromolecular species in the composition), and is generally a substantially purified composition when the object species comprises at least about 50 percent of the macromolecular species present by mole or % weight. Generally, a substantially pure polypeptide composition will comprise about 60% or more, about 70% or more, about 80% or more, about 90% or more, about 95% or more, and about 98% or more of all macromolecular species by mole or % weight present in the composition. In some embodiments, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity (i.e., contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods) wherein the composition consists essentially of a single macromolecular species. Solvent species, small molecules (&lt;500 Daltons), and elemental ion species are not considered macromolecular species.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">The disclosure also provides polynucleotide and nucleic acids encoding the polypeptides described herein. âPolynucleotideâ or ânucleic acid sequenceâ refers to a polymeric form of nucleotides. In some instances a polynucleotide refers to a sequence that is not immediately contiguous with either of the coding sequences with which it is immediately contiguous (one on the 5â² end and one on the 3â² end) in the naturally occurring genome of the organism from which it is derived. The term therefore includes, for example, a recombinant DNA which is incorporated into a vector; into an autonomously replicating plasmid or virus; or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote, or which exists as a separate molecule (e.g., a cDNA) independent of other sequences. The nucleotides of the disclosure can be ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides, or modified forms of either nucleotide. A polynucleotides as used herein refers to, among others, single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. The term polynucleotide encompasses genomic DNA or RNA (depending upon the organism, i.e., RNA genome of viruses), as well as mRNA encoded by the genomic DNA, and cDNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">The polynucleotides may be operatively linked to one or more heterologous regulatory or control sequences that control gene expression to create a recombinant polynucleotide capable of expressing the polypeptide. Expression constructs containing a heterologous polynucleotide encoding the Cel6a variant can be introduced into appropriate host cells to express the polypeptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">Given the knowledge of specific sequences of the Cel6a enzymes (see, e.g., SEQ ID NOs:1, 3, 5, and 7), the polynucleotide sequences will be apparent form the amino acid sequence of the disclosure to one of skill in the art. The knowledge of the codons corresponding to various amino acids coupled with the knowledge of the amino acid sequence of the polypeptides allows those skilled in the art to make different polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides of the disclosure. Thus, the disclosure contemplates each and every possible variation of the polynucleotides that could be made by selecting combinations based on possible codon choices, and all such variations are to be considered specifically disclosed for any of the polypeptides described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">In some embodiments, the polynucleotides encode the polypeptides described herein but have about 80% or more sequence identity, about 85% or more sequence identity, about 90% or more sequence identity, about 91% or more sequence identity, about 92% or more sequence identity, about 93% or more sequence identity, about 94% or more sequence identity, about 95% or more sequence identity, about 96% or more sequence identity, about 97% or more sequence identity, about 98% or more sequence identity, or about 99% or more sequence identity at the nucleotide level to a reference polynucleotide encoding the Cel6a polypeptides of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, or 28 and encode a polypeptide having cellulase activity and thermostability that is greater than a wild-type Cel6a of SEQ ID NO:4, 6, or 8.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">In one embodiment, an isolated polynucleotide of the disclosure comprises at least 80% identity (e.g., 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, 99% identity) to SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, or 27 and which encodes a polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, or 28 and wherein the polypeptide comprises cellulase activity and has improved thermostability compared to a polypeptide comprising SEQ ID NO:4, 6, or 8. In another embodiment, the disclosure provides a polynucleotide comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, and 27. In yet another embodiment, the disclosure provides a polynucleotide comprising a sequence that encodes a polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:6 and having one or more substitutions selected from the group consisting of G37S, Q53F, Q53M, V155A, V158E, Q162L, L276A, L276G, L276S, I307L, K323R, P347W, T436P, Y443F, and Y443W. In yet another embodiment, the disclosure provides a polynucleotide comprising a sequence that encodes a polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:4 and having one or more substitutions selected from the group consisting of N38S, S54F, S54M, V151A, V154E, M158L, C269A, C269G, C269S, Q300L, S316R, S340P, S340W, S430P, S437F, and S437W. In yet another embodiment, the disclosure provides a polynucleotide comprising a sequence that encodes a polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:8 and having one or more substitutions selected from the group consisting of N38S, L54F, L54M, V155A, V158E, Q162L, L276A, L276G, L276S, I307L, S347P, S347W, T436P, Y443F, and Y443W.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">In some embodiments, the isolated polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides may be manipulated in a variety of ways to provide for expression of the polypeptide. Manipulation of the isolated polynucleotide prior to its insertion into a vector may be desirable or necessary depending on the expression vector. The techniques for modifying polynucleotides and nucleic acid sequences utilizing recombinant DNA methods are well known in the art. Guidance is provided in Sambrook et al., 2001, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel. F. ed., Greene Pub. Associates, 1998, updates to 2007.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">In some embodiments, the polynucleotides are operatively linked to control sequences for the expression of the polynucleotides and/or polypeptides. In some embodiments, the control sequence may be an appropriate promoter sequence, which can be obtained from genes encoding extracellular or intracellular polypeptides, either homologous or heterologous to the host cell. For bacterial host cells, suitable promoters for directing transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present disclosure, include the promoters obtained from the <i>E. coli </i>lac operon, <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>xylA and xylB genes, <i>Bacillus megatarium </i>xylose utilization genes (e.g., Rygus et al., (1991) Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 35:594-599; Meinhardt et al., (1989) Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 30:343-350), prokaryotic beta-lactamase gene (Villa-Kamaroff et al., (1978) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 75: 3727-3731), as well as the tac promoter (DeBoer et al., (1983) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 80: 21-25). Various suitable promoters are described in âUseful proteins from recombinant bacteriaâ in Scientific American, 1980, 242:74-94; and in Sambrook et al., supra.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">In some embodiments, the control sequence may also be a suitable transcription terminator sequence, a sequence recognized by a host cell to terminate transcription. The terminator sequence is operably linked to the 3â² terminus of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide. Any terminator which is functional in the host cell of choice may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">In some embodiments, the control sequence may also be a suitable leader sequence, a nontranslated region of an mRNA that is important for translation by the host cell. The leader sequence is operably linked to the 5â² terminus of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide. Any leader sequence that is functional in the host cell of choice may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">In some embodiments, the control sequence may also be a signal peptide coding region that codes for an amino acid sequence linked to the amino terminus of a polypeptide and directs the encoded polypeptide into the cell's secretory pathway. The 5â² end of the coding sequence of the nucleic acid sequence may inherently contain a signal peptide coding region naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the coding region that encodes the secreted polypeptide. Alternatively, the 5â² end of the coding sequence may contain a signal peptide coding region that is foreign to the coding sequence. The foreign signal peptide coding region may be required where the coding sequence does not naturally contain a signal peptide coding region. Effective signal peptide coding regions for bacterial host cells can be the signal peptide coding regions obtained from the genes for <i>Bacillus </i>NClB 11837 maltogenic amylase, <i>Bacillus stearothermophilus </i>alpha-amylase, <i>Bacillus licheniformis subtilisin, Bacillus licheniformis </i>beta-lactamase, <i>Bacillus stearothermophilus </i>neutral proteases (nprT, nprS, nprM), and <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>prsA. Further signal peptides are described by Simonen and Palva, (1993) Microbiol Rev 57: 109-137.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">The disclosure is further directed to a recombinant expression vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding the engineered Cel6a polypeptides, and one or more expression regulating regions such as a promoter and a terminator, a replication origin, etc., depending on the type of hosts into which they are to be introduced. In creating the expression vector, the coding sequence is located in the vector so that the coding sequence is operably linked with the appropriate control sequences for expression.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">The recombinant expression vector may be any vector (e.g., a plasmid or virus), which can be conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures and can bring about the expression of the polynucleotide sequence. The choice of the vector will typically depend on the compatibility of the vector with the host cell into which the vector is to be introduced. The vectors may be linear or closed circular plasmids.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">The expression vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e., a vector that exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g., a plasmid, an extrachromosomal element, a minichromosome, or an artificial chromosome. The vector may contain any means for assuring self-replication. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into the host cell, is integrated into the genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. Furthermore, a single vector or plasmid or two or more vectors or plasmids which together contain the total DNA to be introduced into the genome of the host cell, or a transposon, may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">In some embodiments, the expression vector of the disclosure contains one or more selectable markers, which permit easy selection of transformed cells. A selectable marker is a gene the product of which provides for biocide or viral resistance, resistance to heavy metals, prototrophy to auxotrophs, and the like. Examples of bacterial selectable markers are the dal genes from <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>or <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i>, or markers, which confer antibiotic resistance such as ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol or tetracycline resistance. Other useful markers will be apparent to the skilled artisan.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">In another embodiment, the disclosure provides a host cell comprising a polynucleotide encoding a Cel6a polypeptide, the polynucleotide being operatively linked to one or more control sequences for expression of the polypeptide in the host cell. Host cells for use in expressing the polypeptides encoded by the expression vectors of the disclosure are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, bacterial cells, such as <i>E. coli </i>and <i>Bacillus megaterium</i>; eukaryotic cells, such as yeast cells, CHO cells and the like, insect cells such as <i>Drosophila </i>S2 and <i>Spodoptera </i>Sf9 cells; animal cells such as CHO, COS, BHK, 293, and Bowes melanoma cells; and plant cells. Other suitable host cells will be apparent to the skilled artisan. Appropriate culture mediums and growth conditions for the above-described host cells are well known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">The Cel6a polypeptides of the disclosure can be made by using methods well known in the art. Polynucleotides can be synthesized by recombinant techniques, such as that provided in Sambrook et al., 2001, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel. F. ed., Greene Pub. Associates, 1998, updates to 2007. Polynucleotides encoding the enzymes, or the primers for amplification can also be prepared by standard solid-phase methods, according to known synthetic methods, for example using phosphoramidite method described by Beaucage et al., (1981) Tet Lett 22:1859-69, or the method described by Matthes et al., (1984) EMBO J. 3:801-05, e.g., as it is typically practiced in automated synthetic methods. In addition, essentially any nucleic acid can be obtained from any of a variety of commercial sources, such as The Midland Certified Reagent Company, Midland, Tex., The Great American Gene Company, Ramona, Calif., ExpressGen Inc. Chicago, Ill., Operon Technologies Inc., Alameda, Calif., and many others.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">Engineered enzymes expressed in a host cell can be recovered from the cells and or the culture medium using any one or more of the well known techniques for protein purification, including, among others, lysozyme treatment, sonication, filtration, desalting, ultra-centrifugation, chromatography, and affinity separation (e.g., substrate bound antibodies). Suitable solutions for lysing and the high efficiency extraction of proteins from bacteria, such as <i>E. coli</i>, are commercially available under the trade name CelLytic BTM from Sigma-Aldrich of St. Louis Mo.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">Chromatographic techniques for isolation of the polypeptides include, among others, reverse phase chromatography high performance liquid chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, gel electrophoresis, and affinity chromatography. Conditions for purifying a particular enzyme will depend, in part, on factors such as net charge, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, molecular weight, molecular shape, etc., and will be apparent to those having skill in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">As discussed above, the polypeptide can be used in a variety of applications, such as, among others, biofuel generation, cellulose breakdown and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">The disclosure also provides a recombinant yeast expressing a Cel6a polypeptide variant as described above. The recombinant organisms of the disclosure are useful for bioethanol production. The engineered strains can be evaluated for cellulose hydrolysis and ethanol production under different conditions such as resting and growth conditions in SDC medium. Both small and large-scale (shaker flask/one liter bioreactor) studies can be performed. In resting cell experiments, cells are grown aerobically using glucose as the carbon source. Cells are then washed and used in cellulose anaerobic hydrolysis. Enzyme activity, hydrolysis products, glucose, and ethanol will be monitored using methods described herein. In studies carried out in a fermentor, a mild agitation can be used to promote mixing of solid cellulose material with cells. Once optimized industrial yeast fermentation process may be used. Different cellulose concentrations can also be used. The rate of glucose generation will be estimated from the experiments and compared to those without the modified Cel6a polypeptides. In studies under growing conditions, the cells will be provided cellulose as the sole carbon source, and other nutrients necessary for growth. Anaerobic conditions are maintained. Cell biomass, enzyme activities, glucose and ethanol are measured.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">The disclosure provides yeast strains for direct fermentation of cellulose to ethanol, eliminating the need for use of purified cellulases. The methods and compositions of the disclosure provide abundant, low-cost, agriculture residue to be used as raw material for ethanol production. The increased production of ethanol not only reduces pollution to the environment but also the need for imported petroleum as transportation fuel. Collectively, the benefits from the invention include at least efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly conversion of biomass.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">The disclosure also provides purified enzymes (i.e., Cel6a thermostable variants) that can be used for industrial applications. Under such conditions, the enzymes are purified from a yeast or other microorganism engineered to express the thermostable enzyme and the enzymes are then added to a reactor comprising cellulose to be degraded. Other cellulase enzymes (e.g., Cel7a) can be added to the reactor.</p>

(Nat Protoc, 1(2):755-768, 2006) was adapted and scaled down to generate libraries with 10<sup>4 </sup>colonies. A colony was used to start a 5 mL YPD culture and grown overnight at 30Â° C. and 250 rpm. In the morning, the overnight culture was used to inoculate 10 mL of YPD media per transformation to an OD<sub>600 </sub>of 0.1. The YPD culture was grown at 30Â° C. and 250 rpm until an OD<sub>600 </sub>of 1.5. Once the cells reached the desired absorbance, 100 Î¼L of Tris-DTT buffer per 10 mL of YPD culture was added and incubated at 30Â° C. and 250 rpm for 15 minutes. The cells were pelleted at 2,500 g for 3 minutes at 4Â° C., washed with 10 mL of ice-cold buffer E per 10 mL of culture, and again washed with 1 mL of ice-cold buffer E. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 Î¼L of ice-cold buffer E per transformation. For each transformation, 50 Î¼L competent cells were mixed with 1 Î¼g of DNA in less than 5 Î¼L volume and transferred to an ice-cold 0.2-cm electroporation cuvette. The cells were electroporated at 0.54 kV and 25 Î¼F without a pulse controller and immediately rescued by adding 1 mL of warm (30Â° C.) YPD media. The cells were incubated at 30Â° C. and 250 rpm for 1 hour before plating on SD-Ura agar plates and grown at 30Â° C. for three days.</p>

The competent cells were transformed with 0.5 Î¼g of the linearized vector and 0.5 Î¼g of the error-prone cel6a PCR insert via electroporation and plated on SD-Ura agar plates. The linearized vector and the PCR insert shared regions of homology upstream and downstream of the cel6a gene and were expected to be joined together by homology recombination in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Colonies containing mutant Cel6a were randomly selected and inoculated in 50 Î¼L/well of SD-Ura media in 96-well plates. The culture was grown overnight at 30Â° C., 250 rpm with 80% humidity in orbital shakers. Once the culture in SD-Ura media reached saturation, it was expanded with 350 Î¼L/well of YPD media and grown at 30Â° C., 250 rpm with 80% humidity for an additional of 48 hours. Both the SD-Ura media and the YPD media in 96-well plates were supplemented with 25 Î¼g/mL of kanamycin to prevent bacterial contamination.

      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0126">The half-life is defined as the time at which an enzyme loses 50% of its activity upon incubation at a specified temperature and other conditions (pH, buffer, etc.). More thermostable enzymes exhibit longer half-lives upon incubation. 40 Î¼L of 50 ng/Î¼L Cel6a enzyme in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0 were aliquoted into eppendorf tubes and incubated at the specified temperature for a range of times in the tabletop thermal mixer. At each time point, an aliquot/tube of the enzyme was removed and cooled to 4Â° C. on ice. The range of incubation time was selected such that the half-life would fall approximately in the middle. After the heat inactivation period and cooling, 60 Î¼L of well-agitated 50 mg/mL Avicel solution was added to the enzymes. The solution was subsequently incubated at 50Â° C. for 2 hours, to obtain a measure the enzyme's residual activity. After the hydrolysis reaction, the solution was cooled to 4Â° C. and 50 Î¼L of the supernatant was removed for reducing sugar determination along with cellobiose standards using the Nelson-Somogyi assay as described above. The reducing sugar concentrations over the range of heat inactivation periods were determined using the cellobiose standards, and the natural log of the residual activity at each time point was plotted as a function of time using Excel (Microsoft). The data points were fitted using a 1-parameter linear equation with the y-intercept set to zero, and the half-life of the enzyme was determined using the slope of the fitted equation.</p>

      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0131">Plasmid pHJPlus carrying the HJPlus<sup>his6 </sup>gene served as the template for error-prone PCR using forward primer alpha_HomeRe_Lt and reverse primer His_HomRe_Rt. The gene was flanked by the NheI site and the KpnI site in the plasmid pHJPlus. The primers were designed to have regions of homology 85 base-pairs upstream of the NheI site and 65 base-pair downstream of the KpnI site to allow homologous recombination to occur in yeast. The error rates of the libraries were adjusted using different concentrations of manganese chloride in the PCR reaction. Once the error-prone PCR libraries were expressed in yeast, five colonies were randomly selected for sequencing to determine the error-rates. Once the library with the desired mutation rate was identified, roughly 3000 colonies were randomly selected for total secreted cellobiohydrolase activity evaluation at an elevated temperature in the high-throughput assay. The top 1% of the colonies having higher total activities at 75Â° C. than HJPlus were selected for regrowth and re-evaluation with the activity assay. The total activities from culture supernatants of the top five variants from the rescreen are shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. The plasmid DNA of the top five variants was recovered, and the region of the Cel6a genes was sequenced. Clone 1G6 was identified as the best-performing variant, with a mutation that encodes for amino acid substitution S317P. Other amino acid substitutions discovered among the top five variants are S30F, V128A, V131E, S293R, and S413F.</p>

      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0133">The following example illustrates a method for improving the total activity at elevated temperatures of a cellobiohydrolase by recombining potentially beneficial mutations and screening the resulting variants for higher stability. It also describes the biochemical properties of such improved cellobiohydrolase enzymes.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0134">Plasmid p2B3 carrying the 2B3<sup>his6 </sup>gene served as the template for the recombination of the mutations found in the first two generations of random mutagenesis. The amino acid substitutions included in the recombination library can be found in Table 5. Five PCR fragments were generated using the primers listed in Table 6. The fragments were isolated on 1% TAE agarose gels and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Fragments 1 and 2 were joined together via overlap extension PCR, while fragment 4 and 5 were joined together also via overlap extension PCR. The recombinant library PCR insert was subsequently made using fragment 1+2, 3, and 4+5 using overlap extension PCR.</p>

      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0135">The recombinant library was expressed in yeast, and roughly 600 colonies were randomly selected for total activity evaluation at an elevated temperature in the high-throughput assay. The top 6% of the colonies with higher total activities at 75Â° C. than 2B3 were selected for regrowth and re-evaluation with the activity assay. The total activities of 3-day culture supernatants of the top five variants from the rescreen are shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. Plasmid DNA was recovered from the top five variants, and the region of Cel6a gene was sequenced. The mutations in the top five variants are listed in Table 7. Variant 3C6 was identified as the best performing variant from the high-throughput screen. Mutation S413F and S413P identified in the previous libraries as beneficial were combined in variant 3C6. The total activities of the variants, as well as that of HJPlus and the best variants from each generation, are shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. Variant 3C6P was identified to be superior to 3C6F. The best variant 3C6P from the recombinant library contains the mutation S30F, V128A, M135L, Q277L, S317P, S406P, and S413P in the background of HJPlus Cel6a (see, e.g., US Patent Publication No. 2010/0304464-A1, which is incorporated herein by reference).</p>

      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0136">The following example illustrates a method for improving the total activity at elevated temperatures of a cellobiohydrolase and also describes the biochemical properties of such improved cellobiohydrolase enzymes.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0137">The random mutagenesis libraries described above identified 10 amino acid positions as important for improving the total activity of the cellobiohydrolase at elevated temperatures. The amino acid positions are N14, S30, V128, V131, M135, Q277, S293, S317, S406, and S413 based on the sequence of HJPlus. Plasmid pHJPlus carrying the HJPlus<sup>his6 </sup>gene served as the template for the NNK libraries at the beneficial positions described above. The primers used to construct the NNK libraries can be found in Table 8. The NNK libraries were expressed in yeast, and roughly 90 colonies per NNK library were randomly selected for total activity evaluation at an elevated temperature in the high-throughput assay. Colonies showing an increase of 10% or higher in total activity at 75Â° C. than HJPlus were selected for regrowth and re-evaluation with the activity assay. The plasmid DNA of the top variants at each amino acid position from the rescreen were recovered, and the region of Cel6a gene was sequenced. The beneficial mutations identified from the random mutagenesis libraries were also found as the top variants in the NNK libraries. In other words, the top variants in the NNK libraries identified the same mutations as beneficial as the random mutagenesis libraries. The total activity from 3-day culture supernatant of the top five variants is shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, with the variants identified by the mutations they contain. Among the top five variants, two new beneficial substitutions were discovered: S317W (SEQ ID NO:11 and 12, polynucleotide and polypeptide, respectively) and S413W (SEQ ID NO:13 and 14, polynucleotide and polypeptide, respectively).</p>

      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0138">The following example describes the biochemical properties of the improved cellobiohydrolase enzymes discovered above.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0139">HJPlus, the top variants from the NNK libraries (S317W and S413W), and the best variant from each generation of the mutagenesis libraries (1F4, 1G6, 2B3, 3C6, and 3C6P), as well as other top variants from the mutagenesis libraries (2F4, and 2G6) were expressed in yeast and purified using the AKTApurifierâ¢ FPLC system as described in the methods section. The half-lives of the purified enzymes were determined at 75Â° C. in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and the thermal deactivation in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0 over time was observed to follow a first-order rate equation. As shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, after three rounds of directed evolution, the half-life of the best variant, 3C6P, at 75Â° C. increased approximately twenty-fold compared to HJPlus, from 9.5 minutes to 190 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0140">The T<sub>50 </sub>values of the purified enzymes in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0 were also determined. The T<sub>50 </sub>values of HJPlus, the top two variants from the NNK libraries (S317W and S413W), and the top variants from the mutagenesis libraries (1F4, 1G6, 2B3, 2F4, 2G6, 3C6, and 3C6P) were measured and summarized in Table 9. The top mutations contributed up to 2.4Â° C. in the T<sub>50 </sub>values. The T<sub>50 </sub>value of 3C6P increased by 7.9Â° C., from 71.9Â° C. to 79.8Â° C., from HJPlus. The improvements in total activities observed during the high throughput assay at 75Â° C. can be attributed to a significant increase in the thermostability of the variants.</p>

      <heading id="h-00019-en" level="1">Investigating the pH Dependency of the Top Variants</heading>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0141">The following example illustrates a method of identifying residue site(s) for improvements and investigating the pH dependency of the variants at elevated temperatures.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0142">At high temperatures, certain amino residues such as cysteine or asparagine are prone to chemical modification or destruction that can lead to irreversible thermal inactivation of the enzyme. To examine the effect of cysteine on the thermal inactivation of Family 6 cellulase, the mutation C246G was introduced into the top variant 3C6P, expressed it in yeast, and purified the Cel6 variant using the AKTApurifierâ¢ FPLC system as described in the methods section. The residual activities of the purified C246G Cel6a enzyme after 15-minute inactivation at 70Â° C. through 90Â° C. was examined in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and compared to that of 3C6P. Interestingly, C246G retained a baseline activity after 15-minute incubation at 90Â° C., where 3C6P was completely inactivated in the same reaction condition. Further examination showed that the effect was pH-dependent. The baseline activity at 90Â° C. was the most pronounced at pH 6 and pH 7, followed by pH 5 and pH 8, while 3C6P completely deactivated in the same conditions. At pH 7, the C246G variant retained 73% of the activity after 15-minute inactivation at 90Â° C. (0.29 mM) compared to the residual activity at 70Â° C. (0.40 mM). At pH 6 where C246G is the most active, the variant retained 51% of the activity after 15-minute inactivation at 90Â° C. (0.26 mM) compared to the residual activity at 70Â° C. (0.50 mM). The residual activities of 3C6P and C246G between pH 4 and 9 after 15-minute inactivation at 70Â° C. through 90Â° C. are shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0143">The half-life of C246G was determined as well, and the thermal deactivation was observed to follow a first-order rate equation. The half-life of C246G is the longest at pH 6, followed by pH 7, 8, 5, 9, and 4, demonstrating thermostability as well as stability at alkaline conditions. The half-life of C246G was up to 83 minutes at pH 6, while the half-life of 3C6P at 90Â° C. is less than 5 minutes at various pH. The half-lives of C246G at 90Â° C. at various pH are summarized in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0144">In addition to measuring the residual activity of C246G after thermal inactivation in the form of T<sub>50 </sub>values and half-lives at 90Â° C., the total activities of C246G at various temperatures were measured as well. Specifically, the total activities of 3C6P and C246G after 2 hours of incubation at 80Â° C. and after 4 hours of incubation at 90Â° C. were measured and compared across different pHs. As shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, 3C6P and C246G released the same concentration of cellobiose equivalent across different pHs and at both 80Â° C. and 90Â° C. The only exception is the activity of C246G at pH 4 where C246G exhibited slightly lower activity than 3C6P. Combining our observation on the stability of the C246G variant, this shows that the mutation C246G can greatly enhances the stability of a thermostable Family 6 cellulase, without compromising on the activity of the enzyme.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0145">To investigate the mechanism behind the stabilizing effect of the C246G mutation, other amino acid substitution at residue 246 were tested. Three other variants having mutations at residue C246 in the background of 3C6P were constructed and purified: C246S, C246A, and C246L. The activities of the new variants were determined after inactivating them across a temperature gradient between 70Â° C. and 90Â° C. for 15 minutes at pH 7.0. As shown in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, at pH 7.0 all four variants with mutations at residue C246 exhibited a similar residual activity profile as that of C246G; all four variants retained roughly 35% to 69% activity after heat inactivation.</p>

      <heading id="h-00021-en" level="1">Effect of the pH-Dependent Mutation in the Background of <i>H. jecorina </i>and <i>H. insolens </i>Cel6a</heading>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0146">The following example described the biochemical properties of the pH-dependent mutation in the background of <i>H. jecorina </i>Cel6a and of <i>H. insolens. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0147">Mutation glycine at position 246 (the numbering based on HJPlus) is introduced into the Cel6a enzyme from <i>H. jecorina</i>, which has a cysteine at position 269, and into the Cel6a enzyme from <i>H. insolens</i>, which has a leucine at position 276. The variants HJ C269G and HI L276G were expressed in yeast and purified using the AKTApurifierâ¢ FPLC system as described in the methods section. The residual activities of the purified HJ C269G and HI L276G after 15-minute inactivation was measured at pH 4 to 9 to examine whether the same retention of baseline activity is observed in other Family 6 cellulases. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, the mutation glycine at position 269 and 276 does not stabilize the Cel6a from <i>H. jecorina </i>and <i>H. insolens </i>as it did in HJPlus, as measured by the residual activities after 15-minute thermal inactivation. This is in stark contrast to the C246G variant (in the background of 3C6P), where the variant retained a high fraction of its residual activity, even as the temperature of thermal inactivation increased to 90Â° C. As demonstrated here, this is believed to be due to the fact that both HJ C269G and HI L276G contained another free cysteine that is preventing the enzymes from being thermostabilized by the new mutation as it did in C246G.</p>

      <heading id="h-00023-en" level="1">Effect of the Beneficial Mutations in the Background of <i>H. jecorina </i>Cel6a</heading>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0148">The following example describes the biochemical properties of the beneficial mutations in the background of <i>H. jecorina </i>Cel6a.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0149">Mutations S54F, S316R, and S430P were introduced into the Cel6a enzyme from <i>H. jecorina </i>and expressed in yeast. 4-day yeast culture supernatants were purified using the AKTApurifierâ¢ FPLC system as described in the methods section. The T<sub>50 </sub>values of the purified enzymes in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0 were determined and summarized in Table 10. The mutations contributed up to 1.7Â° C. in the T<sub>50 </sub>values, from 60Â° C. to 61.7Â° C. This shows that the mutations not only stabilize the HJPlus Cel6a enzyme but also the Cel6a enzyme from its closest parent, <i>H. jecorina</i>. The total activities of the enzymes after 2 hours of incubation at 50Â° C. and 60Â° C. were measured in 50 mM NaOAc buffer, pH 5.0. As shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, the improvements in the T<sub>50 </sub>value translated to increases in total activity of the enzyme after 2 hours. The mutants demonstrated an increase up to 13% in total activity at 50Â° C., from 0.23 mM of cellobiose equivalents to 0.26 mM, and an increase up to 19% in total activity at 60Â° C., from 0.26 mM to 0.31 mM. As demonstrated here, it is believed that the beneficial mutations discovered in the background of HJPlus are applicable to other cellulases that share high sequence and/or structural homology with HJPlus, including <i>H. jecoria, H. insolens, C. thermophilum</i>, from which HJPlus is derived, as well as other Family 6 cellulases not listed here. Sequence homology is defined as high when it is 50% or more compared to the sequence of HJPlus. In addition, structural homology is defined as the ones that share the same structural topologies as HJPlus.</p>
