      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This invention relates to cardiac physiology.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">More particularly, this invention relates to the evaluation of electrical propagation in the heart.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation are an important cause of morbidity and death. Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,546,951, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,963, both issued to Ben Haim and PCT application WO 96/05768, all of which are incorporated herein by reference, disclose methods for sensing an electrical property of heart tissue, for example, local activation time, as a function of the precise location within the heart. Data are acquired with one or more catheters having electrical and location sensors in their distal tips, which are advanced into the heart. Methods of creating a map of the electrical activity of the heart based on these data are disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,226,542, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,301,496, both issued to Reisfeld, which are incorporated herein by reference. As indicated in these patents, location and electrical activity is typically initially measured on about 10 to about 20 points on the interior surface of the heart. These data points are then generally sufficient to generate a preliminary reconstruction or map of the cardiac surface. The preliminary map is often combined with data taken at additional points in order to generate a more comprehensive map of the heart's electrical activity. Indeed, in clinical settings, it is not uncommon to accumulate data at 100 or more sites to generate a detailed, comprehensive map of heart chamber electrical activity. The generated detailed map may then serve as the basis for deciding on a therapeutic course of action, for example, tissue ablation, to alter the propagation of the heart's electrical activity and to restore normal heart rhythm.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Electrical activity at a point in the heart is now often measured by advancing a multiple-electrode catheter to measure electrical activity at multiple points in the heart chamber simultaneously. A record derived from time varying electrical potentials as measured by one or more electrodes is known as an electrogram. Electrograms may be measured by unipolar or bipolar leads, and are used, e.g., to determine onset of electrical propagation at a point, known as local activation time.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">There is provided according to embodiments of the invention an apparatus, including a fiberoptic waveguide connectable to an optical receiver, and a plurality of electro-optical elements optically coupled to the waveguide. The electro-optical elements each have a first electrode with a first polarity and a second electrode with a second polarity. A light-emitting diode is linked to the first electrode and configured for illuminating the waveguide responsively to an electrical potential between the first electrode and the second electrode at a respective wavelength.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">According to one aspect of the apparatus, the second electrodes of the electro-optical elements are connected in common.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">According to a further aspect of the apparatus, the electro-optical elements further comprise respective transmissive optical elements, and the waveguide includes a core and a cladding layer formed coaxially about the core. The cladding layer has optically transparent gaps formed therein, and the transmissive optical elements overlie the gaps.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In yet another aspect of the apparatus, an optic terminator is disposed in the waveguide.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">According to still another aspect of the apparatus, the electro-optical elements further comprise an analog-to-digital converter linked to the first electrode and to the light-emitting diode.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">According to an additional aspect of the apparatus, the electro-optical elements further comprise an amplifier linked to the first electrode and to the analog-to-digital converter.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Another aspect of the apparatus includes a third electrode and a wire connected to the third electrode for exchanging electrical signals between the third electrode and a source.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">One aspect of the apparatus, the waveguide is coaxially disposed within a probe.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">According to a further aspect of the apparatus, the first electrode and the second electrode are spaced apart from the light-emitting diode at a distance measured from an exterior of the waveguide to an outer wall of the probe.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">There is further provided according to embodiments of the invention a method, which is carried out by inserting a probe into a heart of a living subject to contact a target, and connecting the probe to an optical receiver.

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various principles of the present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art, however, that not all these details are necessarily needed for practicing the present invention. In this instance, well-known circuits, control logic, and the details of computer program instructions for conventional algorithms and processes have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the general concepts unnecessarily.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The terms âlinkâ, âlinksâ, âcoupleâ and âcouplesâ are intended to mean either an indirect or direct connection. Thus, if a first device couples to a second device, that connection may be through a direct connection, or through an indirect connection via other devices and connections.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Turning now to the drawings, reference is initially made to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, which is a pictorial illustration of a system <b>10</b> for performing ablative procedures on a heart <b>12</b> of a living subject, which is constructed and operative in accordance with a disclosed embodiment of the invention. The system comprises a catheter <b>14</b>, which is percutaneously inserted by an operator <b>16</b> through the patient's vascular system into a chamber or vascular structure of the heart <b>12</b>. The operator <b>16</b>, who is typically a physician, brings the catheter's distal tip <b>18</b> into contact with the heart wall at a target site. Electrical activation maps may then be prepared, according to the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,226,542, and 6,301,496, and in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,892,091, whose disclosures are herein incorporated by reference. One commercial product embodying elements of the system <b>10</b> is available as the CARTOÂ® 3 System, available from Biosense Webster, Inc., 3333 Diamond Canyon Road, Diamond Bar, Calif. 91765. This system may be modified by those skilled in the art to embody the principles of the invention described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Areas determined to be abnormal, for example by evaluation of the electrical activation maps, can be ablated by application of thermal energy, e.g., by passage of radiofrequency electrical current through wires in the catheter to one or more electrodes at the distal tip <b>18</b>, which apply the radiofrequency energy to the myocardium. The energy is absorbed in the tissue, heating it to a point (typically about 50Â° C.) at which it permanently loses its electrical excitability. When successful, this procedure creates non-conducting lesions in the cardiac tissue, which disrupt the abnormal electrical pathway causing the arrhythmia. The principles of the invention can be applied to different heart chambers to treat many different cardiac arrhythmias.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The catheter <b>14</b> typically comprises a handle <b>20</b>, having suitable controls on the handle to enable the operator <b>16</b> to steer, position and orient the distal end of the catheter as desired for the ablation. To aid the operator <b>16</b>, the distal portion of the catheter <b>14</b> may comprise position sensors (not shown) that provide signals to a positioning processor <b>22</b>, located in a console <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Ablation energy and electrical signals can be conveyed to and from the heart <b>12</b> through one or more ablation electrodes <b>32</b> located at or near the distal tip <b>18</b> via cable <b>34</b> to the console <b>24</b>. Pacing signals and other control signals may be conveyed from the console <b>24</b> through the cable <b>34</b> and the electrodes <b>32</b> to the heart <b>12</b>. Sensing electrodes <b>33</b>, also connected to the console <b>24</b> are disposed between the ablation electrodes <b>32</b> and have connections to the cable <b>34</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Wire connections <b>35</b> may link the console <b>24</b> with body surface electrodes <b>30</b> and other components of a positioning sub-system. The electrodes <b>32</b> and the body surface electrodes <b>30</b> may be used to measure tissue impedance at the ablation site as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 7,536,218, issued to Govari et al., which is herein incorporated by reference. A temperature sensor (not shown), typically a thermocouple or thermistor, may be mounted on or near each of the electrodes <b>32</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The console <b>24</b> typically contains one or more ablation power generators <b>25</b>. The catheter <b>14</b> may be adapted to conduct ablative energy to the heart using any known ablation technique, e.g., radiofrequency energy, ultrasound energy, and laser-produced light energy. Such methods are disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,814,733, 6,997,924, and 7,156,816, which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The positioning processor <b>22</b> is an element of a positioning subsystem in the system <b>10</b> that measures location and orientation coordinates of the catheter <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In one embodiment, the positioning subsystem comprises a magnetic position tracking arrangement that determines the position and orientation of the catheter <b>14</b> by generating magnetic fields in a predefined working volume and sensing these fields at the catheter, using field generating coils <b>28</b>. The positioning subsystem may employ impedance measurement, as taught, for example in U.S. Pat. No. 7,756,576, which is hereby incorporated by reference, and in the above-noted U.S. Pat. No. 7,536,218.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">As noted above, the catheter <b>14</b> is coupled to the console <b>24</b>, which enables the operator <b>16</b> to observe and regulate the functions of the catheter <b>14</b>. Console <b>24</b> includes a processor, preferably a computer with appropriate signal processing circuits. The processor is coupled to drive a monitor <b>29</b>. The signal processing circuits typically receive, amplify, filter and digitize signals from the catheter <b>14</b>, including signals generated by the above-noted sensors and a plurality of location sensing electrodes (not shown) located distally in the catheter <b>14</b>. The digitized signals are received and used by the console <b>24</b> and the positioning system to compute the position and orientation of the catheter <b>14</b>, and to analyze the electrical signals from the electrodes.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Typically, the system <b>10</b> includes other elements, which are not shown in the figures for the sake of simplicity. For example, the system <b>10</b> may include an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor, coupled to receive signals from one or more body surface electrodes, to provide an ECG synchronization signal to the console <b>24</b>. As mentioned above, the system <b>10</b> may include a reference position sensor, either on an externally-applied reference patch attached to the exterior of the subject's body, or on an internally-placed catheter, which is inserted into the heart <b>12</b> maintained in a fixed position relative to the heart <b>12</b>. Conventional pumps and lines for circulating liquids through the catheter <b>14</b> for cooling the ablation site may be provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Reference is now made to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, which is a schematic diagram of a catheter <b>37</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The catheter <b>37</b> comprises a fiberoptic cable <b>39</b> having multiple sensor assemblies <b>41</b> mounted along its distal portion, and an optical terminator <b>43</b>. The fiberoptic cable <b>39</b> may consist of a single multimode optical fiber comprising a core and cladding layer. Gaps, defects or plugs are formed in the cladding layer beneath the assemblies <b>41</b> and are sufficiently optically transparent to permit passage of light produced in the assemblies <b>41</b> into the core. Each of the assemblies <b>41</b> has a positive electrode <b>45</b> and a negative electrode <b>47</b>. The negative electrode <b>47</b> of all the assemblies <b>41</b> are connected in common. The positive electrodes <b>45</b> are connected to respective conductive rings <b>49</b>. The conductive rings <b>49</b> encircle the exterior of the fiberoptic cable <b>39</b>. Signals reflecting the electrical potential of the conductive rings <b>49</b> and the positive electrode <b>45</b> are communicated from the positive electrodes <b>45</b> to a respective light-emitting diode LED <b>51</b> that is disposed in each of the assemblies <b>41</b>. Light emitted by the LED <b>51</b>, represented by arrows <b>53</b>, propagates within interior <b>55</b> of the fiberoptic cable <b>39</b> toward an optical receiver (not shown).</p>

A common connection <b>69</b> links the negative electrodes <b>47</b>. An optical receiver (not shown) coupled to the proximal end of the catheter <b>37</b> discriminates the optical signals produced by the assemblies <b>57</b>, <b>59</b>, <b>61</b> using methods known in the art of wavelength division multiplexing. The optical signals are converted to analog or digital electrical signals and processed conventionally in the console <b>24</b> (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
