      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) mutation/deficiency, also known as atypical Rett syndrome, is a debilitating postnatal neurological disorder that occurs worldwide in 1 of every 17000 to 38000 female births. Males are also affected at a lower incidence. This disorder is not limited to ethnic or racial origin. Symptoms of CDKL5 mutation/deficiency range from mild to severe and present as early onset seizure, cognitive disability, hypotonia as well as autonomic, sleep and gastrointestinal disturbances. Symptoms of disease result from the deficiency of a functional CDKL5 protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Mutations in the X-linked CDKL5 gene or deficiencies in the CDKL5 protein in individuals are implicated in the development of atypical or congenital Rett syndrome. See Bertani et al., J. biol. Chem. 2006, 281:32048-320 56, Scala et al., J. Med. Gen., 2005. 42:103-107, and Kalscheuer et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003. 72:1401-1411. The CDKL5 gene is located on the X-chromosome and encodes a protein that is essential for normal brain development and function. CDKL5 protein is a multifunctional protein that has multiple effects in a neuronal cell. For example, CDKL5 can act as a kinase and phosphorylate MeCP2. Girls affected by the CDKL5 mutations or deficiencies typically have a normal prenatal history; irritability and drowsiness in the perinatal period; early-onset epilepsy with onset before 5 months of age, Rett-like features, including deceleration of head growth, stereotypies, poor to absent voluntary hand use, and sleep disturbances, and severe mental retardation with poor eye contact and virtually no language. See Bahi-Buisson and Bienvenu. 2012. Mol. Syndromol. 2:137-152.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Current treatments for CDKL5 mutations/deficiencies are primarily focused on managing symptoms. However, there are currently no treatments that improve the neurological outcome of subjects with CDKL5 mutations or deficiencies. As such, there exists a need for development of therapies for treating the CDKL5 mutations and deficiencies.</p>

      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0216">To produce a deliverable TAT-CDKL5 fusion protein a synthetic TATÎº-PTD in which mutation of the furin recognition sequences in the TAT domain allows secretion of recombinant proteins was used. The secreted protein was observed to be successfully taken up by the target cells. TATk-CDKL5 fusion gene containing a human CDKL5 was cloned into the expression plasmid pSecTag2 (Life Technologies). This plasmid is designed to allow expression of genes in mammalian hosts and high expression levels of target proteins. Proteins expressed from pSecTag2 are fused at the N-terminus to the murine IgÎº chain leader sequence for protein secretion in culture medium. The TATk-CDKL5 fusion protein was tagged with a GFP protein to allow for western blot analysis using an anti-GFP antibody. To facilitate protein purification, the TATk-CDKL5 fusion protein was configured to include a myc-tag and 6xHis tag at the C-terminal region of the TATk-GFP-CDKL5 gene. HEK 293T cells were transfected with the TATk-GFP-CDKL5 expression plasmid using standard plasmid delivery methods. After transfection cells were left to grow in serum-free medium (High glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium). After 48 hours medium was collected, diafiltered and concentrated with Amicon ultra centrifugal filters (50 kDa cut-off). This method allows buffer exchange and enrichment of the secreted protein.</p>

TATk-GFP-CDKL5 fusion protein was purified from culture medium on a Ni-NTA resin. It has been shown that the CDKL5 kinase has a high autophosphorylation activity. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, which shows the results from an in vitro kinase activity assay, purified TATk-GFP-CDKL5 protein preserves its autophosphorylation activity.

After different incubation times cells were lysed and total protein extracts were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting for TATk-GFP-CDKL5 protein quantification. As shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, TATk-GFP-CDKL5 is internalized by cells after only about 30 minutes of incubation. Other cultures were treated in parallel and were fixed and immunostained with an anti-GFP specific antibody to visualize the transduced TATk-GFP-CDKL5 protein. As demonstrated in <figref>FIGS. 7A-7B</figref>, TATk-GFP-CDKL5 protein was efficiently translocated into the cells.

      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0220">In spite of the clear importance of CDKL5 for the central nervous system, the biological functions of this kinase remain largely unknown. CDKL5 gene affects both proliferation and differentiation of neural cells (See e.g. Valli et al., 2012. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1819:1173-1185, and Rizzi et al., 2011. Brain Res. 1415:23-33). Neuroblastoma cells share several features with normal neurons and thus are considered a good in vitro model to study the biochemical and functional properties of neuronal cells, particularly when they are induced to differentiate upon treatment with agents such as retinoic acid (RA) (See e.g., Singh, 2007 Brain Res. 1154 p 8-21; Melino, 1997 J. Neurooncol. 31 pp 65-83). For these reasons, neurobastoma cells were employed to study the CDKL5 function in vitro.</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0221">SH-SY5Y cells were treated with purified TATk-GFP-CDKL5 similar to the treatment of described in Example 3. Here, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with the concentrated media containing the purified TATk-GFP-CDKL5 protein for about 24 hours. Cell proliferation was evaluated as mitotic index (the ratio between the number of cells in a population undergoing mitosis to the number of cells not undergoing mitosis) using Hoecsht nuclear staining Differentiation was evaluated by examining neurite growth, which is a sign of neuronal differentiation. For analysis of neurite growth, cells were grown for an additional 1-2 days in the presence or absence of the pro-differentiation agent, RA. Neurite outgrowth was measured using an image analysis system.</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0222">Induction of CDKL5 expression (by TATk-GFP-CDKL5 protein) caused a strong inhibition of cell proliferation (e.g., <figref>FIGS. 9A-9B</figref>, and 10) with no increase in apoptotic cell death (data not shown) compared to controls. Further, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 11A-11B</figref> and <b>12</b>, TATk-GFP-CDKL5 promotes neuroblastoma cell differentiation as indicated by neurite outgrowth in SH-SY5Y cells. These results demonstrate that TATk-CDKL5 is functional in an in vitro neuronal model.</p>

      <heading id="h-00019-en" level="1">Characterization of the CDKL5-KO Mouse Model</heading>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0223">A CDKL5 knockout mouse model has been recently created by the EMBL in Monterotondo, Italy, by the group lead by Dr. Cornelius Gross (Amendola, 2014 PLoS One. 9(5):e91613). To establish the effect of CDKL5-loss of function on dendritic development of newborn neurons, the dendritic morphology of newborn hippocampal granule cells derived from the CDKL5 KO mouse was examined. Dendritic morphology of newborn neurons was analyzed with immunohistochemistry for doublecortin (DCX), taking advantage of the expression of this protein in the cytoplasm of immature neurons during the period of neurite elongation. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 13A-13B</figref>, DCX-positive cells of CDKL5 knockout mice (â/Y) exhibited a dendritic tree with a highly immature pattern (<figref>FIG. 13B</figref>) compared to the wild type (+/Y) counterparts (<figref>FIG. 13A</figref>). A highly immature pattern can be evidenced by little branching and elongation. Absence of CDKL5 resulted in a decrease in the number of DCX-positive cells (<figref>FIG. 13B</figref>) due to an increase in apoptotic cell death (data not shown) that was observed to affect postmitotic immature granule neurons (DCX-positive cells) (Fuchs, 2014 Neurobiol Dis. 70 p 53-68). This data suggests that CDKL5 plays a fundamental role on postnatal neurogenesis, by affecting neural precursor survival and maturation of newborn neurons. Cultures of neuronal precursor cells (NPCs) from the subventricolar zone (SVZ) of Cdk15 knockout mice were observed to exhibit the same defects observed in vivo in cerebellar granule cell precursors. Namely, in cultures of neuronal precursor cells derived from wild type mice (+/+) there were more neurons (Î²-tubulin III positive cells, red cells) than in cultures of neuronal precursor cells derived from CDKL5 KO (â/â) mice (<figref>FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>). This suggests that the loss of CDKL5 decreases the survival of postmitotic neurons. Assessment of neurite outgrowth in Î²-tubulin III positive cells demonstrated that neurons generated from Cdk15 knockout NPCs were less differentiated compared to wild type neurons (<figref>FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>). These results suggest that postmitotic NPCs from CDKL5 knockout mice have an intrinsic defect, not only in cell survival, but also in neuronal maturation.</p>

      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0224">Neuronal precursor cells cultures from the CDKL5 KO (â/â) mouse and wild-type (+/+) mouse were treated with TATk-GFP-CDKL5 or TATk-GFP. Neuronal maturation was evaluated by measuring the total neuritic length of differentiated neurons (positive for Î²-tubulin III). Evaluation of neurite length was performed by using the image analysis system Image Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, Md. 20910, USA). The average neurite length per cell was calculated by dividing the total neurite length by the number of cells counted in the areas. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 15A-15C</figref> and <b>16</b>, absence of CDKL5 causes a reduction in the maturation of new neurons and treatment with TATk-CDKL5 restores neurite development.</p>

      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0225">Seven-day old mouse pups were subcutaneous injected with a single dose of culture medium of HEK293T cells transfected with TATk-GFP-CDKL5, TATk-GFP or medium from untrasfected cells (vehicle) (single dose corresponded to about 200 Î¼l of 200Ã concentrated medium; which contained about 1-1.5 Î¼g of the fusion protein). Culture medium was collected after 48 hours from transfection and was diafiltered and concentrated with Amicon ultra centrifugal filters (50 kDa cut-off). Mice were sacrificed 4 hours post-administration of the treatment. Brains were stored in the fixative for 24 hours, cut along the midline and kept in 20% sucrose in phosphate buffer for an additional 24 hours. Hemispheres were frozen and stored at â80Â° C. The right hemisphere was cut with a freezing microtome in 30-Î¼m-thick coronal sections. Immunohistochemistry was carried out on free-floating sections. Localization of TATk-GFP-CDKL5 and TATk-GFP in the brain was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using an anti-GFP antibody and a TSA amplification kit. Images were taken at the level of the sensory-motor cortex and the cerebellum. Cells were counterstained using 4â²,6-diamidino)-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Representative images demonstrating presence of the TATk-GFP-CDKL5 protein in the sensory-motor cortex and cerebellum of mice are shown in <figref>FIGS. 17A-17F</figref> and <figref>FIGS. 18A-18D</figref>, respectively. Given that the TATk-GFP-CDKL5 protein was subcutaneous administered, this data demonstrates that the TATk-GFP-CDKL5 protein is effectively transported across the blood brain barrier and enters into brain cells.</p>

      <heading id="h-00025-en" level="1">Effect of TATk-CDKL5 Fusion Protein In Vivo on Neuronal Maturation, Survival and Connectivity</heading>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0226">Adult mice (4-6 months of age) were intraventricularly injected (<figref>FIG. 19</figref>) for 5 consecutive days (see e.g. <figref>FIG. 20</figref> for experimental schedule) with TATk-GFP-CDKL5 or TATk-GFP. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100-125 mg/kg) and xylazine (10-12.5 mg/kg). Cannulas (0.31-mm diameter, Brain Infusion Kit III; Alzet Cupertino, Calif.) were stereotaxically implanted into the lateral ventricles (A/Pâ0.4-mm caudal, M/L 1.0 mm, D/Vâ2.0 mm; <figref>FIG. 19</figref>). Seven days after implantation mice were infused for 5 consecutive days with 10 Î¼l (about 50 ng) of TATk-GFP-CDKL5 or TATk-GFP in PBS by using a Hamilton syringe connected to a motorized nanoinjector (at a rate of 0.5 l/min). Four hours after the last injection animals were sacrificed, and the dendritic morphology of newborn hippocampal granule cells was analyzed with immunohistochemistry for DCX. <figref>FIGS. 21 and 22</figref> demonstrate that DCX positive neurons of Cdk15 KO mice had shorter processes than those of their wild type counterparts (<figref>FIGS. 21A-21B</figref> and <b>22</b>A-<b>22</b>B). TATk-GFP-CDKL5 fusion protein administered intraventricularly on five consecutive days was observed to increase neurite length and branch number in CDKL5 knockout mice (<figref>FIG. 22C</figref>) to levels similar to wild-type (<figref>FIG. 22A</figref>). <figref>FIGS. 23A-23B</figref> show examples of the reconstructed dendritic tree of newborn granule cells of wild-type (+/Y) (<figref>FIG. 23A</figref>), hemizygous CDKL5 knockout mice (â/Y) (<figref>FIG. 23B</figref>), and hemizygous CDKL5 knockout male mice treated with a TATk-GFP-CDKL5 fusion protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0227">Quantification of the dendritic size of DCX positive cells demonstrate that CDKL5 knockout mice (â/Y) mice had a shorter dendritic length (<figref>FIG. 24A</figref>) and a reduced number of segments (<figref>FIG. 24B</figref>) than wild type mice (<figref>FIGS. 24A and 24B</figref>). In TATk-GFP-CDKL5 treated CDKL5 knockout mice (â/Y) mice there was an increase in both parameters that became even larger in comparison with +/Y mice (<figref>FIGS. 24A-24B</figref>). The effects of TATk-GFP-CDKL5 treatment on details of the dendritic architecture were examined by evaluating each dendritic order separately. A striking feature of CDKL5 KO mice was the absence of branches of higher order (<figref>FIGS. 25A-25B</figref>; red arrows). While wild type (+/Y) mice had up to 10 orders of branches, CDKL5 knockout mice (â/Y) mice lacked branches of orders 8-10 (<figref>FIG. 25A</figref>, arrows). In addition, CDKL5 knockout mice (â/Y) mice showed a reduced branch length of orders 5-8 (<figref>FIG. 25A</figref>) and a reduced number of branches of orders 6-8 (<figref>FIG. 25B</figref>). Taken together, these data indicate that in Cdk15 KO mice the dendritic tree of the newborn granule cells is hypotrophic and that this defect is due to a reduction in the number and length of branches of intermediate order and a lack of branches of higher order. All these defects were observed to be completely rescued by TATk-GFP-CDKL5 treatment (<figref>FIGS. 25A to 25B</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0228">In order to evaluate the effect of TATk-GFP-CDKL5 treatment on apoptotic cell death, we counted the number of apoptotic cells expressing cleaved caspase-3 in the hippocampal dentate gyms (<figref>FIG. 26</figref>). Quantification of cleaved caspase-3 cells shows that TATk-GFP-CDKL5 treatment completely normalized apoptotic cell death in CDKL5 knockout mice (â/Y) (<figref>FIG. 26</figref>). It was observed that CDKL5 knockout mice (â/Y) mice had fewer postmitotic neurons (DCX-positive cells) than wild type (+/Y) mice in the hippocampal dentate gyms (<figref>FIG. 27</figref>). TATk-GFP-CDKL5-treated CDKL5 knockout mice underwent an increase in the number of postmitotic neurons that became similar to those of wild type (+/Y) mice (<figref>FIG. 27</figref>). This indicates that the increased death of posmitotic immature granule cells that characterizes CDKL5 knockout mice is rescued by TATk-GFP-CDKL5 treatment. Taken together, these data demonstrate that treatment with TATk-GFP-CDKL5 in CDKL5 knockout mice increased neurite length and survival of newborn cells in the hippocampus indicating that injected TATk-CDKL5 diffused from the lateral ventricle to the hippocampus and restored maturation and survival of postmitotic granule cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0229">Without being bound by any one theory, a reduction in connectivity may be the counterpart of the dendritic hypotrophy that characterizes the newborn granule cells of CDKL5 KO mice. Synaptophysin (SYN; also known as p38) is a synaptic vesicle glycoprotein that is a specific marker of presynaptic terminals. Here, it was observed in CDKL5 knockout mice (â/Y) mice that the optical density of SYN was significantly lower than in wild type (+/Y) mice in the molecular layer of the hippocampus (<figref>FIGS. 28 and 30A</figref>), suggesting that CDKL5 KO mice had fewer synaptic contacts in the dentate gyms. <figref>FIGS. 28A-28C</figref> show representative images demonstrating brain sections processed for synaptophysin (SYN) immunofluorescence from the molecular layer (Mol) of the dentate gryrus (DG) from a wild-type male mouse (+/Y) (<figref>FIG. 28A</figref>), a hemizygous CDKL5 knockout male mouse (â/Y) (<figref>FIG. 28B</figref>), and a hemizygous CDKL5 knockout male mouse treated with TATk-GFP-CDKL5 fusion protein via intraventricular injections given once a day for 5 consecutive days (â/Y+TATk-GFP-CDKL5) (<figref>FIG. 28C</figref>). One out of six 30-Î¼m-thick coronal sections from the DG of animals were processed for immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was carried out on free-floating sections for the frozen brains. For Synaptophysin immunohistochemistry, sections were incubated for 48 hours at 4Â° C. with mouse monoclonal anti-SYN (SY38) antibody (1:1000, MAB 5258, Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents) and for 2 hours with a Cy3 conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:200; Jackson Immunoresearch. Intensity of immunoreactivity (IR) was determined by optical densitometry of immunohistochemically stained sections. Fluorescence images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with a Nikon Digital Camera DXM1200 (ATI system). Densitometric analysis in the molecular layer and cortex was carried out using Nis-Elements Software 3.21.03 (Nikon). For each image, the intensity threshold was estimated by analyzing the distribution of pixel intensities in the image areas that did not contain IR. This value was then subtracted to calculate IR of each sampled area. Values are given as a percentage of the optical density of control CDKL5+/Y mice (mean+standard error).</p>

After a two day rest period at the conclusion of 10 days of injections, mice in all groups received the Morris Water Maze (MWM) testing (<figref>FIG. 33</figref>). MWM measures the ability to find and recall the position of a platform submerged in water. Mice were trained in the MWM task to locate a hidden escape platform in a circular pool. The apparatus consisted of a large circular water tank (1.00 m diameter, 50 cm height) with a transparent round escape platform (10 cm2). The pool was virtually divided into four equal quadrants identified as northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest. The tank was filled with tap water at a temperature of 22Â° C. up to 0.5 cm above the top of the platform and the water was made opaque with milk. The platform was placed in the tank in a fixed position (in the middle of the north-west quadrant). The pool was placed in a large room with a number of intra- (squares, triangles, circles and stars) and extra-maze visual cues. After training, each mouse was tested for two sessions of 4 trials each per day, for 5 consecutive days with an inter-session interval of 40 minutes (acquisition phase). A video camera was placed above the center of the pool and connected to a videotracking system (Ethovision 3.1; Noldus Information Technology B.V., Wageningen, Netherlands). Mice were released facing the wall of the pool from one of the following starting points: North, East, South, or West and allowed to search for up to 60 seconds for the platform. If a mouse did not find the platform, it was gently guided to it and allowed to remain there for 15 seconds. During the inter-trail time (15 seconds) mice were placed in an empty cage. The latency to find the hidden platform was used as a measure of learning. All experimental sessions were carried out between 9.00 am and 15.00 pm.</p>

After 10 consecutive days of treatment and a two day rest period, mice of the various groups received passive avoidance testing (<figref>FIG. 34</figref>). The experiment utilized a test cage with two chambers (light and dark). On day one (conditioning period), animals were placed in the light chamber and instinctively move into the dark chamber where they are conditioned with a single adverse event (foot shock). For the passive avoidance test we used a tilting-floor box (47Ã18Ã26 cm) divided into two compartments by a sliding door and a control unit incorporating a shocker (Ugo Basile, Italy). This classic instrument for Pavlovian conditioning exploits the tendency in mice to escape from an illuminated area into a dark one (step-through method). On the first day mice were individually placed into the illuminated compartment. After 60 seconds of habituation period, the connecting door between the chambers opened. In general, mice step quickly through the gate and enter the dark compartment because mice prefer to be in the dark. Upon entering the dark compartment, mice received a brief foot shock (0.7 mA for 3 seconds) and were removed from the chamber after 15 seconds of latency. If the mouse remained in the light compartment for the duration of the trial (358 s), the door closed and the mouse was removed from the light compartment. The chambers were cleaned with 70% ethanol between testing of individual mice. After a 24 hour retention period, mice were placed back into the light compartment and the time it took them to re-enter the dark compartment (latency) was measured up to 358 seconds.</p>

On day two (testing period) (<figref>FIG. 34B</figref>) animals were again placed in the light chamber. Memory of the adverse event was measured by latency time to enter the dark chamber. CDKL5 knockout mice (â/Y) were severely impaired at performing this task, as demonstrated by a reduced latency to enter the dark compartment in comparison with wild-type mice (+/Y).
