      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The present invention relates generally to a beverage dispensing device for dispensing a beverage such as beer, and in particular, to a beverage dispensing device being configured for dispensing a beverage and infusing the beverage with a flavour as part of the dispensing process.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Devices for dispensing beverages, such as beer, have been well established. Typically, draught beer is served in hotels and pubs and is served from a keg or cask, rather than from a bottle. The keg or cask is typically remotely located from the dispensing point, namely a beer font that consists of a beer tap and a dispensing handle. The beer is typically pressurised for delivery from the beer font and a variety of chilling systems have been developed to ensure that the beer dispensed from the tap of the beer font is at a desirable temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Whilst draught beers are popular in pubs and clubs, there is limited opportunity to alter the taste of the beer prior to dispensing. In recent times there has been a growing trend for beer drinkers to move toward premium or boutique beer as an alternative to standard draught beers. Typically, boutique or premium beers are able to experiment with different tastes and flavours and may be crafted to enable infusing with a variety of different fruits and the like to enhance the flavour of the beverage and the overall drinking experience for the consumer.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Whilst the concept of infusing a beverage with fruits, herbs and the like has been well established, this is typically performed as a separate step in the process of production of the beverage. Many infused beers include the infusion process as part of the overall brewing process and as such, such beers are distributed to retailers for sale with the infusion process already performed. Alternatively, it is common for premium beers to be served with a slice of lemon or lime in order to enhance the flavour of the beer, and this is generally done by placing a slice of lemon or lime in the drink after dispensing the drink and immediately prior to consumption.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In recent times, the fonts for dispensing beers and other beverages in bars and hotels have become more visually and aesthetically appealing to improve the decor of the venue. In this regard, many fonts employ techniques to facilitate the formation of ice on the surfaces of the fonts or fonts may have distinctive shapes that are visually appealing and add to the overall aesthetics of the venue.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Thus, there is a need to provide a dispensing system for dispensing beer and other beverages that is able to be simply adapted to be used to infuse the beverage with a flavor as part of the dispensing process, preferably in a visually appealing manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The above references to and descriptions of prior proposals or products are not intended to be, and are not to be construed as, statements or admissions of common general knowledge in the art. In particular, the above prior art discussion does not relate to what is commonly or well known by the person skilled in the art, but assists in the understanding of the inventive step of the present invention of which the identification of pertinent prior art proposals is but one part.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">ASPECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The invention according to one or more aspects is as defined in the independent claims. Some optional and/or preferred features of the invention are defined in the dependent claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Accordingly, in one aspect of the invention there is provided a beverage dispensing device including: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>a body configured to receive a supply of beverage from a source and having a pouring means mounted thereto for dispensing said beverage; and</li><li>an infusion chamber mounted to said body, the infusion chamber defining an enclosed space for receiving one or more infusion products;</li><li>wherein, the infusion chamber is in fluid communication with said body so as to receive the supply of beverage therefrom such that the beverage passes through said infusion chamber prior to being dispensed from the pouring means.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0017">In one embodiment, the enclosed space of the infusion chamber is able to be maintained at a substantially constant temperature and pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0018">A heat exchanger may be provided to enable the enclosed space of the infusion chamber to be maintained at or close to a predetermined temperature. The heat exchanger may be located wholly or partly within the body of the beverage dispending device and/or the infusion chamber mounted to said body. In one embodiment, the heat exchanger may extend within the infusion chamber. In another embodiment, the heat exchanger may extend within the body of the device. In a further embodiment, the heat exchanger may be associated with the body to chill the beverage prior to entering the infusion chamber. The heat exchanger may include one or more of a glycol plate, an ice bank chiller, the lines associated with said glycol plate or said ice bank chiller, an in-line heat exchanger, or another conventional heat exchanger known to the person skilled in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0019">The infusion chamber may include a tubular body made from a substantially transparent material.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0020">The tubular body of the infusion chamber may be substantially cylindrical and may be mounted to the body of the dispensing device so as to be positioned above said body of the dispensing device.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0021">The infusion chamber may receive the supply of beverage via a delivery pipe that projects from the body of the dispensing device to extend within the infusion chamber and terminate adjacent an upper region of the infusion chamber. The delivery pipe may substantially fill the infusion chamber with the beverage such that the beverage is maintained in the infusion chamber under pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0022">The body may have an outlet formed on an upper surface thereof for receiving the beverage present in the infusion chamber. The outlet may be in direct fluid communication with the pouring means such that the beverage can be dispensed from the pouring means under pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0023">The pouring means may be a tap, nozzle, valve, plug, spout or any combination of these other outlets suitable for pouring a beverage.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0024">The infusion chamber may have a secondary pouring means to enable dispensing of the beverage directly from the infusion chamber, the secondary pouring means being located at or near an upper part of the infusion chamber. The infusion chamber optionally includes a pressure relief valve for releasing air pressure from the infusion chamber. The pressure relief valve may be a spring activated valve able to be pushed down to release air pressure from the infusion chamber. The pressure relief valve may be associated with a secondary pouring means to enable a portion of the beverage to be poured directly from the infusion chamber via the secondary pouring means when the pressure relief valve is activated.</p>

      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0039">Various operations may be described as multiple discrete operations in turn, in a manner that may be helpful in understanding embodiments of the present invention; however, the order of description should not be construed to imply that these operations are order dependent.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0040">* Preferred features of the present invention will now be described with particular reference to the accompanying drawings. However, it is to be understood that the features illustrated in and described with reference to the drawings are not to be construed as limiting on the scope of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0041">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, a beverage dispensing device <b>10</b> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown. More particularly, <figref>FIG. 1A</figref> depicts a beverage dispensing device <b>10</b> where the infusion chamber <b>20</b> is filled with a beverage but does not have infusion products within the chamber. <figref>FIG. 2A</figref> depicts a beverage dispensing device <b>10</b> where the infusion chamber <b>20</b> is filled with a beverage and infusion products <b>5</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0042">The present invention will be described in relation to the dispensing of beer, such as a draught beer. However, it will be appreciated that the present invention could be employed to dispense a variety of different types of beverages, such as cider, and non-alcoholic beverages, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0043">The beer dispensing device, or font <b>10</b> generally includes a body <b>15</b> that is mounted on a bar or similar dedicated serving area such that the font is displayed in the manner as depicted in <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. The body <b>15</b> is generally in the form of a stainless steel cylindrical tube that houses one or more beer lines (not shown) therein for supplying the beer to the font <b>10</b>. The body <b>15</b> or infusion chamber <b>20</b> may also incorporate a heat exchanging device (not shown) for chilling the beer present in the beer lines as the beverage passes through the body <b>15</b> or infusion chamber <b>20</b>. The heat exchanging device may be a glycol plate, an ice bank chiller, the lines associated with said glycol plate or said ice bank chiller, an in-line heat exchanger, or another conventional heat exchanger. It will be appreciated that there exist a number of systems for supplying draught beer from a keg located remotely from the font <b>10</b> in a pressurized and chilled manner. Most modern beer supply systems employ beer pythons that include a beer line bundled with a coolant line to ensure that the beer is kept at a substantially constant temperature as it travels from the keg, or storage unit, to the beer tap. These systems also function to reduce the growth of wild yeasts and bacteria within the beer lines, thereby reducing the potential of beer wastage as a result.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0044">Whether via a heat exchanging device or a beer python type beer delivery system, having a heat exchanger in close proximity to the infusion chamber is important to enable the beer in the chamber to be held at a substantially consistent temperature and pressure. This, in turn, is important for limiting foaming of the beer within the device and/or hindering the infusion process within the infusion chamber, which may result from fluctuating temperatures and pressures of the beverage in the device, or from the infusing material and the beverage being at different temperatures.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0045">A beer tap <b>14</b> is mounted to the body <b>15</b> in the manner as shown. The beer tap operates as a pouring means. The beer tap <b>14</b> includes a handle <b>12</b> that is able to open the tap to facilitate dispensing of the beverage from the tap <b>14</b> in a controlled manner. In the embodiment of the present invention as shown, only one beer tap <b>14</b> is depicted. However, it will be appreciated that multiple taps <b>14</b> may be mounted to the body <b>15</b> as desired, with each tap <b>14</b> having a dedicated beer line for delivering beer thereto and each tap having a handle <b>12</b> to be operated independently to dispense beer therefrom.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0046">An infusion chamber <b>20</b> is mounted to the upper region of the body <b>15</b>, as shown. As will be discussed in more detail below, the infusion chamber <b>20</b> includes a clear and see-through tubular body <b>22</b> that may be made from a plastic or glass material with an end cap <b>23</b> sealing the distal end thereof. The infusion chamber <b>20</b> is able to be opened so as to be filled with fruit or any other material that enables the beer being dispensed by the font <b>10</b> to be infused with the material contained therein immediately prior to dispensing from the tap <b>14</b>. <figref>FIG. 1B</figref> depicts the font <b>10</b> filled with fruit <b>5</b>, such as lemons or limes to facilitate infusing of the beer being delivered with a citrus flavor in the manner to be described in more detail below. It will be appreciated that other materials may be used for infusing other flavors into the beer, as desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0047">As is depicted in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the infusion chamber <b>20</b> generally includes an elongate cylindrical space <b>21</b> that is defined by the cylindrical body <b>22</b>. The tubular body <b>22</b> is mounted to the upper surface <b>16</b> of the body <b>15</b> and a central pedestal <b>24</b> extends from the surface of the body <b>15</b> substantially centrally within the space <b>21</b>. The pedestal <b>24</b> has a threaded distal end that is configured to engage with a complementary internally threaded recess provided in the end cap <b>23</b> such that the end cap <b>23</b> is able to be tightened to about the cylindrical body <b>22</b> to securely retain the cylindrical body <b>22</b> in position on the upper surface <b>16</b> of the body <b>15</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0048">To ensure that the cylindrical body <b>22</b> is sealed at both its upper and lower ends, a seat is formed in both the underside of the end cap <b>23</b> (not shown) and the upper surface <b>16</b> of the body <b>15</b> to receive the ends of the cylindrical body <b>22</b>. The seat <b>17</b> formed in the upper surface <b>16</b> of the body <b>15</b> is depicted in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0049">The seat <b>17</b> generally includes a circular groove or channel foamed in the upper surface <b>16</b> which receives a rubber ring or gasket. A similar arrangement may be formed in the underside of the end cap <b>23</b> such that as the end cap <b>23</b> is screwed into position on the end of the pedestal <b>24</b>, pressure is placed on the ends of the cylindrical body <b>22</b> to form a watertight seal at either end with the rubber ring or gasket formed in the seat <b>17</b>. In this regard, when the body <b>22</b> is secured in position in such a manner, the space <b>21</b> becomes a substantially sealed and airtight space.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0050">Referring again to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a delivery pipe <b>26</b> also extends from the upper surface <b>16</b> of the body <b>15</b> to extend substantially parallel to the pedestal <b>24</b>. The delivery pipe <b>26</b> has an open end <b>27</b> that terminates before the end of the pedestal such that the delivery pipe <b>26</b> is able to deliver beer into the space <b>21</b> from an upper region thereof, in the direction of arrow âAâ. The other end of the delivery pipe <b>26</b> is in contact with the beer line (not shown) such that the beer is delivered into the space <b>21</b> under pressure and at a substantially constant delivery temperature. In this regard, the space <b>21</b> essentially fills with beer and is maintained at or close to the desired pressure such that the beer present in the space <b>21</b> is directly directed to the tap <b>14</b> for dispensing. To facilitate regulation of pressure within the space <b>21</b>, a pressure relief valve <b>28</b> may be provided in the end cap <b>23</b> as shown.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0051">The pressure relief valve <b>28</b> is a spring activated valve that can be pushed down to release air pressure from within the infusion chamber. The infusion chamber <b>20</b> further includes a secondary pouring means <b>29</b> associated with the pressure relief valve <b>28</b>. The pouring means <b>29</b> is a curved pouring tube which extends from an upper part of the infusion chamber <b>20</b> and it is able to pour a portion of the beer directly from the infusion chamber when the pressure relief valve <b>28</b> is activated.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0052">The manner in which the beer present in the space <b>21</b> of the infusion chamber <b>20</b> is directed to the tap <b>14</b> is shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. In this regard, an outlet <b>18</b> is formed in the upper surface <b>16</b> of the body <b>15</b> which is directly connected to the tap <b>14</b> by way of a return tube (not shown). In this regard, as the tap <b>14</b> is opened, beer present in the return tube is delivered from the tap <b>14</b> which draws beer from the space <b>21</b> which is maintained at the desired delivery pressure and temperature. As the space <b>21</b> is pressurised, as the beer is consumed from the space <b>21</b> it is replaced by the beer present in the delivery pipe <b>26</b> which maintains the level of fluid in the space <b>21</b> at the desired pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0053">In accordance with the present invention, when the space <b>21</b> contains fruit <b>5</b> or other infusing material, the beer present in the space passes through the infusing material <b>5</b> as it passes from the open end <b>27</b> of the delivery pipe <b>26</b> to the outlet <b>18</b>. This then enables the beer to be infused with the flavouring of the infusing material immediately prior to being dispensed from the tap <b>14</b>. The amount of infusing material <b>5</b> present in the space <b>21</b> may vary in accordance with taste and flavouring requirements and as discussed previously, no infusing material needs to be present for the font <b>10</b> to function. If no infusing material <b>5</b> is used, the infusion chamber <b>20</b> will be filled with beer which will provide an interesting aesthetic effect, even without the presence of infusing material <b>5</b>. Should infusing material <b>5</b> be used, a filter <b>19</b> may be provided over the outlet <b>18</b> to avoid any particulate material being dispensed from the tap <b>14</b>, or entering the fluid line.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0054">It will be appreciated that the temperature of the beer present in the infusion chamber <b>20</b> will be maintained at the desired delivery temperature due to the close proximity of the beverage with the heat exchanger and cooling lines provided with the beer delivery system. Should additional chilling or greater temperature control within the device be required, the pedestal <b>24</b> may comprise a hollow tube such that a coolant could be passed along inside the hollow tube of the pedestal <b>24</b> to provide additional chilling of the beer present in the infusion chamber <b>20</b>. Alternatively, the coolant could be passed around the pedestal <b>24</b> by tubing carrying the coolant being wrapped around the pedestal.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0055">By providing a heat exchanger, such as a chiller device associated with the font <b>10</b>, the beverage and the infusing material is maintained in a chilled state thereby reducing the likelihood of foaming of the beverage occurring as it passes through the infusing material. This is a significant problem where infusing is applied whereby the infusing material and the beverage are at different temperature. The present invention addresses this issue by creating a chilled environment where the beverage and the infusing material are contained at a substantially constant pressure and temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0056">It will be further appreciated that the font <b>10</b> of the present invention provides a simple and effective device for infusing a beverage, such as beer, with a flavoring prior to dispensing the beverage. This is achieved in a simple and effective manner and provides a clear and striking visual impression of the process as it is being performed. A consumer is able to see the infusing process and immediately taste the result, which has considerable advantages in terms of marketing and visual effect.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0057">Further to this, the device of the present invention can be simply disassembled from cleaning and replacement of the infusing material as desired, and can operate simply and effectively in the absence of an infusing material, as a conventional beer font.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0058">Throughout the specification and claims the word âcompriseâ and its derivatives are intended to have an inclusive rather than exclusive meaning unless the contrary is expressly stated or the context requires otherwise. That is, the word âcompriseâ and its derivatives will be taken to indicate the inclusion of not only the listed components, steps or features that it directly references, but also other components, steps or features not specifically listed, unless the contrary is expressly stated or the context requires otherwise.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0059">Orientational terms used in the specification and claims such as vertical, horizontal, top, bottom, upper and lower are to be interpreted as relational and are based on the premise that the component, item, article, apparatus, device or instrument will usually be considered in a particular orientation, typically with the end cap of the device uppermost.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0060">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that many modifications and variations may be made to the methods of the invention described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0061">Having described at least one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, it will be apparent to those skills that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various modifications and variations can be made in the presently disclosed system without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present disclosure cover modifications and variations of this disclosure provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
