      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The invention relates to the field of molecular virology and immunology, particularly the field concerning the treatment of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In particular, the invention relates to epitope peptides or (mutants thereof) for treating HBV infection, recombinant proteins comprising said epitope peptides (or mutants thereof) and carrier proteins, and uses of said epitope peptides (or mutants thereof) and said recombinant proteins. The invention also relates to antibodies against said epitope peptides, cell lines for producing said antibodies, and uses thereof. The invention also relates to vaccines or pharmaceutical composition for treating or alleviating one or more symptoms associated with HBV infection, comprising the recombinant proteins or antibodies, respectively.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">HBV infection, particularly chronic HBV infection is one of the most important public sanitation problems globally (Dienstag J L. Hepatitis B virus infection. N Engl J Med 2008 Oct. 2; 359(14):1486-1500). Chronic HBV infection may cause a series of liver diseases such as Chronic hepatitis B (CHB), Liver cirrhosis (LC) and Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Liaw Y F, Chu C M. Hepatitis B virus infection. Lancet 2009 Feb. 14; 373(9663): 582-592). It is reported that there are about 2 billion persons infected by HBV, and there are about 350 million persons infected with chronic HBV in the whole world now. Among these infected persons, the risk of finally dying of liver diseases associated with HBV infection reaches up to 15%-25%, and more than 1 million persons die of these diseases every year in the whole world (Dienstag J L., vide supra; and Liaw Y F et al., vide supra).</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The therapeutic agents for chronic HBV infection now may be divided mainly into Interferons (IFNs) and nucleoside or nucleotide analogues (NAs) (Dienstag J L., vide supra; Kwon H, Lok A S. Hepatitis B therapy. Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol 2011 May; 8(5): 275-284; and Liaw Y F et al., vide supra). The former includes common interferon (IFN) and Peg-interferon (Peg-IFN), which achieve the effect of inhibiting HBV and treating CHB mainly by enhancing the overall immunocompetennce in patients; the latter mainly includes lamivudine (LMV), adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), Entecavir (ETV), Telbivudine (LdT) and Tenofovir, which inhibit the HBV replication mainly by directly inhibiting polymerase activity of HBV. For HBV infected persons (e.g, CHB patients), said agents alone or in combination have already effectively inhibited virus replication in vivo, and greatly reduced HBV DNA level; in particular, after such a treatment for 52 weeks or longer, response rate that HBV DNA level was lower than the detection limit (virological response) in patients reached 40-80% (Kwon H et al., vide supra). However, the treatment with said agents alone or in combination cannot completely clear up HBV viruses in infected persons, and the response rate of the negative conversion ratio of HBsAg or HBsAg serological conversion (a marker indicative of complete clearance of HBV viruses in patients) is generally lower than 5% (Kwon H et al., vide supra). Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to develop novel therapeutic methods and agents capable of more effectively clearing up HBV viruses, particularly clearing up HBsAg for HBV infected patients.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">It is one of the important research directions in this field to develop new agents for treating chronic HBV infection based on immunological means. Immunotherapy of chronic HBV infection is generally performed in two manners, i.e. passive immunotherapy (corresponding to medicaments in the form of antibodies, etc.) and active immunotherapy (corresponding to medicaments in the form of vaccines, etc.). Passive immunotherapy (with antibody as an example) refers to the process of administering a therapeutic antibody to a HBV infected patient and preventing naÃ¯ve hepatocytes from HBV infection by virtue of antibody-mediated virus neutralization, or clearing up viruses and infected hepatocytes in vivo by virtue of antibody-mediated immune clearance, thereby achieving a therapeutic effect. Now, Anti-HBs polyclonal antibodies, obtained from serum/plasma of responder immunized with hepatitis B vaccine or rehabilitee of HBV infection, i.e. high-titer hepatis B immunoglobulin (HBIG), have been widely applied to blockage of mother-infant vertical transmission of HBV, prevention of chronic HBV infected patient from HBV re-infection after liver transplantation, and prevention of people accidently exposed to HBV from infection. However, the therapy concerning direct administration of HBIG to HBV-infected patients (e.g., CHB patients) has no significant therapeutic effect, and HBIG is restricted in many aspects such as relatively few sources of high-titer plasma, high cost, unstable property, and potential security problems. Active immunotherapy refers to the process of administering therapeutic vaccines (including protein vaccines, polypeptide vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines, etc.), stimulating chronic HBV-infected organism to raise cellular immunologic response (CTL effect, etc.) or/and humoral immunologic response (antibodies, etc.) to HBV, thereby achieving the purpose of inhibiting or clearing HBV. Now, there are no agents/vaccines for active immunotherapy that are definitely effective and are useful for treating chronic HBV infection yet.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to develop novel therapeutic methods and agents capable of more effectively treating HBV infection for HBV infected patients.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">CONTENTS OF INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Although there are multiple B cell response (antibody response) epitopes on various proteins of HBV virus, an antibody against an arbitrary epitope is not necessarily useful in the treatment of HBV infection. Therefore, the key of developing immunotherapeutic agents/methods effective in treating HBV infection lies in identification of targets (epitopes) capable of inducing effective clearance of viruses and cells infected by viruses in vivo and the obtainment of antibodies against the targets (epitopes).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The invention identifies such targets (epitopes), and therefore provides epitope peptides (or mutants thereof) useful in treatment of HBV infection, recombinant proteins comprising said epitope peptides (or mutants thereof) and carrier proteins, and uses of said epitope peptides (or mutants thereof) and recombinant proteins. The invention also provides antibodies against such epitope peptides/epitopes, cell lines producing said antibodies, and uses thereof. The invention also provides vaccines or pharmaceutical compositions useful in treating or relieving one or more symptoms associated with HBV infection, comprising recombinant proteins or antibodies according to the invention, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In the invention, unless otherwise specified, the scientific and technical terms used herein have the meanings as generally understood by a person skilled in the art. Moreover, the laboratory operations of cell culture, molecular genetics, nucleic acid chemistry and immunology used herein are the routine operations widely used in the corresponding fields. Meanwhile, in order to better understand the invention, the definitions and explanations of the relevant terms are provided as follows.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">As used herein, the term âHBsAgâ refers to surface antigen protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is well known by a person skilled in the art (see, for example, NCBI GENBANK Database accession number: AAF24729.1).</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">As used herein, when the amino acid sequence of HBsAg is mentioned, it is described by the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 39. For example, the expression âamino acid residues from positions 119 to 125 of HBsAgâ refers to the amino acid residues from positions 119 to 125 of the polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO: 39. However, a person skilled in the art understands that mutations or variations (including, but not limited to, substitution, deletion and/or addition, for example, HBsAg of a different genotype or a different gene subtype) may occur naturally in or be introduced artificially into the amino acid sequence of HBsAg without affecting its biological properties. Therefore, in the invention, the term âHBsAgâ intends to comprise all such polypeptides, for example, including the polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO: 39 and its natural or artificial mutants. In addition, when sequence fragments of HBsAg are described, they include not only the sequence fragments of SEQ ID NO: 39, but also the corresponding sequence fragments of its natural or artificial mutants. For example, the expression âamino acid residues from positions 119 to 125 of HBsAgâ comprises amino acid residues from positions 119 to 125 of SEQ ID NO: 39 and the corresponding fragments of its mutants (natural or artificial mutants). According to the invention, the expression âcorresponding sequence fragmentsâ or âcorresponding fragmentsâ refers to fragments that are located in equal positions of sequences when the sequences are subjected to optimized alignment, namely, the sequences are aligned to obtain a highest percentage of identity.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">As used herein, the term âHBcAgâ refers to core antigen protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is well known by a person skilled in the art (see, for example, NCBI GENBANK Database Accession No: AA063517.1).</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">As used herein, when the amino acid sequence of HBcAg is mentioned, it is described by the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 40. For example, the expression âamino acid residues from positions 79 to 81 of HBcAgâ refers to the amino acid residues from positions 79 to 81 of the polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO: 40. However, a person skilled in the art understands that mutations or variations (including, but not limited to, substitution, deletion and/or addition, for example, HBcAg of a different genotype or a different gene subtype) may occur naturally in or be introduced artificially into the amino acid sequence of HBcAg without affecting its biological properties. Therefore, in the invention, the term âHBcAgâ intends to comprise all such polypeptides, for example, including the polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO: 40 and its natural or artificial mutants. In addition, when sequence fragments of HBcAg are described, they include not only the sequence fragments of SEQ ID NO: 40, but also the corresponding sequence fragments of its natural or artificial mutants. For example, the expression âamino acid residues from positions 79 to 81 of HBcAgâ comprises amino acid residues from positions 79 to 81 of SEQ ID NO: 40 and the corresponding fragments of its mutants (natural or artificial mutants). According to the invention, the expression âcorresponding sequence fragmentsâ or âcorresponding fragmentsâ refers to fragments that are located in equal positions of sequences when the sequences are subjected to optimized alignment, namely, the sequences are aligned to obtain a highest percentage of identity.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">As used herein, the term âWHcAgâ refers to woodchuck hepatitis virus core antigen, which is well known by a person skilled in the art (see, for example, NCBI GENBANK Database accession number: ADE19018.1).</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">As used herein, when the amino acid sequence of WHcAg is mentioned, it is described by the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 41. For example, the expression âamino acid residues from positions 79 to 81 of WHcAgâ refers to the amino acid residues from positions 79 to 81 of the polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO: 41. However, a person skilled in the art understands that mutations or variations (including, but not limited to, substitution, deletion and/or addition, for example, WHcAg of a different genotype or a different gene subtype) may occur naturally in or be introduced artificially into the amino acid sequence of WHcAg without affecting its biological properties. Therefore, in the invention, the term âWHcAgâ intends to comprise all such polypeptides, for example, including the polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO: 41 and its natural or artificial mutants. In addition, when sequence fragments of WHcAg are described, they include not only the sequence fragments of SEQ ID NO: 41, but also the corresponding sequence fragments of its natural or artificial mutants. For example, the expression âamino acid residues from positions 79 to 81 of WHcAgâ comprises amino acid residues from positions 79 to 81 of SEQ ID NO: 41 and the corresponding fragments of its mutants (natural or artificial mutants). According to the invention, the expression âcorresponding sequence fragmentsâ or âcorresponding fragmentsâ refers to fragments that are located in equal positions of sequences when the sequences are subjected to optimized alignment, namely, the sequences are aligned to obtain a highest percentage of identity.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">As used herein, the term âCRM197 (Cross-Reacting Materials 197)â refers to a non-toxic mutant of diphtheria toxin (DT), which differs from a wild-type diphtheria toxin by an amino acid residue at position 52, which is changed from Gly to Glu (G. Giannini, R. Rappuoli, G. Ratti et al., Nucleic Acids Research. 1984. 12: 4063-4070). Diphtheria toxin is well known by a person skilled in the art (see, e.g., Choe S, Bennett M, Fujii G, et al., Nature. 1992. 357:216-222), the amino acid sequence of which may be found, for example, by reference to GenBank Database accession No. AAV70486.1.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">As used herein, when the amino acid sequence of CRM197 is mentioned, it is described by the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 42. For example, the expression âamino acid residues from positions 1 to 190 of CRM197â refers to the amino acid residues from positions 1 to 190 of SEQ ID NO: 42. However, a person skilled in the art understands that mutations or variations (including, but not limited to, substitution, deletion and/or addition) may occur naturally in or be introduced artificially into SEQ ID NO: 42 without affecting the biological properties of CRM197. Therefore, in the invention, the term âCRM197â intends to comprise all such polypeptides, for example, including the polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO: 42 and its natural or artificial mutants. In addition, when sequence fragments of CRM197 are described, they include not only the sequence fragments of SEQ ID NO: 42, but also the corresponding sequence fragments of its natural or artificial mutants. For example, the expression âamino acid residues from positions 1 to 190 of CRM197â comprises amino acid residues from positions 1 to 190 of SEQ ID NO: 42 and the corresponding fragments of its mutants (natural or artificial). According to the invention, the expression âcorresponding sequence fragmentsâ or âcorresponding fragmentsâ refers to fragments that are located in equal positions of sequences when the sequences are subjected to optimized alignment, namely, the sequences are aligned to obtain a highest percentage of identity.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">As used herein, the term âantibodyâ generally refers to an immunoglobulin molecule consisting of two pairs of polypeptide chains (each has a light (L) chain and a heavy (H) chain). Light chains of an antibody may be classified into Îº and Î» light chain. Heavy chains may be classified into Î¼, Î´, Î³, Î± and Îµ, which define isotypes of an antibody as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE, respectively. In a light chain and a heavy chain, a variable region is linked to a constant region via a âJâ region of about 12 or more amino acids, and a heavy chain further comprises a âDâ region of about 3 or more amino acids. Each heavy chain consists of a heavy chain variable region (V<sub>H</sub>) and a heavy chain constant region (C<sub>H</sub>). A heavy chain constant region consists of 3 domains (C<sub>H</sub>1, C<sub>H</sub>2 and C<sub>H</sub>3). Each light chain consists of a light chain variable region (V<sub>L</sub>) and a light chain constant region (C<sub>L</sub>). A light chain constant region consists of a domain C<sub>L</sub>. The constant region of an antibody can mediate the binding of an immunoglobulin to a host tissue or factor, including various cells (e.g., effector cells) of an immune system and a first component (C1q) of classical complement system. V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>region can also be divided into hypervariable regions (called complementary determining regions (CDR)), which are interspaced by relatively conservative regions (called framework region (FR)). Each V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>consists of 3 CDRs and 4 FRs in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4 from N-terminal to C-terminal. The variable region (V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L</sub>) of each heavy/light chain pair forms antigen binding sites, respectively. Distribution of amino acids in various regions or domains follows the definition in Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987 and 1991)), or Chothia &amp; Lesk (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917; Chothia et al., (1989) Nature 342:878-883. The term âantibodyâ is not restricted by any specific method for producing antibodies. For example, antibodies include particularly, recombinant antibodies, monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies. Antibodies may be of different antibody isotypes, for example, IgG (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 subtype), IgA1, IgA2, IgD, IgE or IgM antibody.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">As used herein, the term âantigen binding fragmentâ refers to polypeptides comprising fragments of a full-length antibody, which retain the ability of specifically binding to an antigen that the full-length antibody specifically binds to, and/or compete with the full-length antibody for binding to the same antigen, also known as âantigen binding portionâ. Generally, see Fundamental Immunology, Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., the second edition, Raven Press, N.Y. (1989), which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Antigen binding fragments of an antibody may be produced by recombinant DNA techniques or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of an intact antibody. Under some conditions, antigen binding fragments include Fab, Fabâ², F(abâ²)<sub>2</sub>, Fd, Fv, dAb and complementary determining region (CDR) fragments, single chain antibody (e.g. scFv), chimeric antibody, diabody and such polypeptides that comprise at least part of antibody sufficient to confer the specific antigen binding ability on the polypeptides.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">As used herein, the term âFd fragmentâ refers to antibody fragment consisting of V<sub>H </sub>and C<sub>H</sub>1 domain; the term âFv fragmentâ refers to antibody fragment consisting of V<sub>L </sub>and V<sub>H </sub>domain of a single arm; the term âdAb fragmentâ refers to antibody fragment consisting of V<sub>H </sub>domain (Ward et al., Nature 341:544-546 (1989)); the term âFab fragmentâ refers to antibody fragment consisting of V<sub>L</sub>, V<sub>H</sub>, C<sub>L </sub>and C<sub>H</sub>1 domain; the term âF(abâ²)<sub>2 </sub>fragmentâ refers to antibody fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked to each other via disulphide bridge(s) on hinge region.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Under some conditions, antigen binding fragments of an antibody are single chain antibodies (e.g. scFv), wherein V<sub>L </sub>and V<sub>H </sub>domain are paired to form a monovalent molecule via a linker that enables them to produce a single polypeptide chain (see, for example, Bird et al., Science 242:423-426 (1988) and Huston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883 (1988)). Such scFv molecules generally have a common structure: NH<sub>2</sub>âV<sub>L</sub>-linker-V<sub>H</sub>âCOOH or NH<sub>2</sub>âV<sub>H</sub>-linker-V<sub>L</sub>âCOOH. Suitable linkers in the prior art consist of repeated GGGGS amino acid sequence or variants thereof. For example, a linker having an amino acid sequence (GGGGS)<sub>4 </sub>may be used, and its variants may also be used (Holliger et al., (1993), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448). Other linkers that may be used in the invention are described by Alfthan et al., (1995), Protein Eng. 8:725-731, Choi et al., (2001), Eur. J. Immunol. 31: 94-106, Hu et al., (1996), Cancer Res. 56:3055-3061, Kipriyanov et al., (1999), J. Mol. Biol. 293:41-56 and Roovers et al., (2001), Cancer Immunol.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Under some conditions, antigen binding fragments of an antibody may be diabodies, i.e. divalent antibodies, wherein V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domain are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, however, the linker used is too short to allow the pairing of the two domains on the same chain, the domains have to be paired with the complementary domains on another chain to produce two antigen binding sites (see, for example, Holliger P. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448 (1993), and Poljak R. J. et al., Structure 2:1121-1123 (1994)).</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Antigen binding fragments (e.g. the antibody fragments as described above) of an antibody may be obtained from a given antibody (e.g., the monoclonal antibody E6F6 provided in the invention) by conventional techniques known by a person skilled in the art (e.g., recombinant DNA technique or enzymatic or chemical cleavage methods), and may be screened for specificity in the same manner by which inact antibodies are screened.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In the invention, unless specified definitely, when the term âantibodyâ is mentioned, it includes not only intact antibodies, but also antigen binding fragments of the antibodies.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">As used herein, the term âMAbâ and âmonoclonal antibodyâ refer to an antibody or a fragment of an antibody from a population of highly homologous antibody molecules, i.e. a population of completely identical antibody molecules except for natural mutation that may occur spontaneously. A monoclonal antibody has a high specificity for a single epitope of an antigen. Polyclonal antibody, relative to monoclonal antibody, generally comprises at least two or more different antibodies which generally recognize different epitopes on an antigen. Monoclonal antibodies are generally obtained by hybridoma technique reported by Kohler et al. for the first time (Nature, 256:495, 1975), and can also be obtained by recombinant DNA technique (see, for example, U.S.P 4,816,567).</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">As used herein, monoclonal antibodies mentioned with their numbers are identical to the monoclonal antibodies obtained from the hybridomas with the same numbers. For example, monoclonal antibody HBs-E6F6 (E6F6 for short), HBs-E7G11 (E7G11 for short), HBs-G12F5 (G12F5 for short) and HBs-E13C5 (E13C5 for short) are identical to the antibodies obtained from hybridoma cell line HBs-E6F6 (E6F6 for short) or subclone or progeny cell thereof, HBs-E7G11(E7G11 for short) or subclone or progeny cell thereof, HBs-G12F5 (G12F5 for short) or subclone or progeny cell thereof, and HBs-E13C5 (E13C5 for short) or subclone or progeny cell thereof, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">As used herein, the term âchimeric antibodyâ refers to such an antibody wherein a part of its light chain and/or heavy chain is derived from an antibody (which may be originated from a specific species or belongs to a specific antibody type or subtype), and the other part of its light chain and/or heavy chain is derived from another antibody (which may be originated from an identical or different species or belongs to an identical or different antibody type or subtype), provided that the antibody still retains the activity of binding to the antigen of interest (U.S.P 4,816,567 to Cabilly et al.; Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81: 6851-6855 (1984)).</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">As used herein, the term âhumanized antibodyâ refers to an antibody or antibody fragment in which all the CDR regions or a part of CDR regions of human immunoglobulin (receptor antibody) are replaced with the CDR regions of a non-human antibody (donor antibody), wherein the donor antibody may be non-human (e.g., mouse, rat or rabbit) antibody having the expected specificity, affinity or reactivity. In addition, some amino acids of framework regions (FRs) of a receptor antibody may also be replaced by the corresponding amino acid residues of a non-human antibody, or amino acid residues of another antibody, so as to further improve or optimize the properties of the antibody. With respect to more detailed contents relating to humanized antibodies, please see, for example, Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Reichmann et al., Nature, 332:323-329 (1988); Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 2:593-596 (1992); and Clark, Immunol. Today 21: 397-402 (2000).</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">As used herein, the term âneutralization antibodyâ refers to an antibody or antibody fragment that can eliminate or significantly reduce virulence (e.g. ability of infecting cells) of viruses of interest.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">As used herein, the term âepitopeâ refers to a portion on antigen that an immunoglobulin or antibody specifically binds to. âEpitopeâ is also known as âantigenic determinantâ. Eptiope or antigenic determinant generally consists of chemically active surface groups of a molecule such as amino acids, carbohydrates or sugar side chains, and generally has a specific three-dimensional structure and a specific charge characteristic. For example, an epitope generally comprises at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 consecutive or non-consecutive amino acids in a unique steric conformation, which may be âlinearâ or âconformationalâ. See, for example, Epitope Mapping Protocols in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 66, G. E. Morris, Ed. (1996). In a linear epitope, all the interaction sites between a protein and an interaction molecule (e.g., an antibody) are present linearly along the primary amino acid sequence of the protein. In a conformational epitope, the interaction sites span over amino acid residues that are separate from each other in a protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">As used herein, the term âepitope peptideâ refers to peptide fragment on antigen that acts as epitope. Under some conditions, epitope peptide alone can be specifically recognized/bound by an antibody against the epitope. Under some other conditions, epitope peptide has to be fused to a carrier protein to facilitate the epitope to be specifically recognized by an antibody. As used herein, the term âcarrier proteinâ refers to such a protein that may act as a carrier of epitope peptide, i.e. the epitope peptide may be inserted into the protein at a specific position (for example, inner, N-terminal or C-terminal of the protein), so that the epitope peptide can be presented and thus can be recognized by an antibody or immune system. Such carrier proteins are well known by a person skilled in the art, including, for example, HPV L1 protein (into which the epitope peptide may be inserted between amino acids from positions 130 to 131 or amino acids from positions 426 to 427 of the protein, see Slupetzky, K. et al., Chimeric papillomavirus-like particles expressing a foreign epitope on capsid surface loops[J]. J Gen Virol, 2001, 82: 2799-2804; Varsani, A. et al., Chimeric human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) L1 particles presenting the common neutralizing epitope for the L2 minor capsid protein of HPV-6 and HPV-16[J]. J Virol, 2003, 77: 8386-8393), HBV core antigen (the amino acids from positions 79 to 81 of the protein may be replaced with the epitope peptide, see, Koletzki, D., et al. HBV core particles allow the insertion and surface exposure of the entire potentially protective region of Puumala hantavirus nucleocapsid protein [J]. Biot Chem, 1999, 380: 325-333), woodchuck hepatitis virus core protein (the amino acids from positions 79 to 81 of the protein may be replaced with the epitope peptide, see, Sabine KÃ¶nig, Gertrud Beterams and Michael Nassal, <i>J. Virol</i>. 1998, 72(6):4997), and CRM197 protein (the epitope peptide may be linked to the N-terminal or C-terminal of the protein or a fragment thereof). Optionally, a linker (e.g., a rigid or flexible linker) may be used between an epitope peptide and a carrier protein to promote their foldings, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Antibodies may be screened depending on competitiveness of binding to the same epitope by conventional techniques known by a person skilled in the art. For example, study on competition or cross-competition may be conducted to obtain antibodies that compete or cross-compete with each other for binding to antigens (e.g. HBsAg protein). High-throughput methods for obtaining antibodies binding to the same epitope, which are based on their cross-competition, are described in an international patent application WO 03/48731. Therefore, antibodies and antigen binding fragments (i.e. antigen binding portions) thereof, which compete with monoclonal antibodies according to the invention (e.g. monoclonal antibody E6F6) for binding to the same epitopes on HBsAg protein, can be obtained by conventional techniques known by a person skilled in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">As used herein, the term âisolatedâ refers to a state obtained from natural state by artificial means. If a certain âisolatedâ substance or component is present in nature, it is possible because its natural environment changes, or the substance is isolated from natural environment, or both. For example, a certain unisolated polynucleotide or polypeptide naturally exists in a certain living animal body, and the same polynucleotide or polypeptide with a high purity isolated from such a natural state is called isolated polynucleotide or polypeptide. The term âisolatedâ excludes neither the mixed artificial or synthesized substance nor other unpure substances that do not affect the activity of the isolated substance.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">As used herein, the term â<i>E. coli </i>expression systemâ refers to an expression system consisting of <i>E. coli </i>(strain) and a vector, wherein the <i>E. coli </i>(strain) are derived from the commercially available strains, including, but not limited to: G1698, ER2566, BL21 (DE3), B834 (DE3), and BLR (DE3).</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">As used herein, the term âvectorâ refers to a nucleic acid vehicle which can have a polynucleotide inserted therein. When the vector allows for the expression of the protein encoded by the polynucleotide inserted therein, the vector is called an expression vector. The vector can have the carried genetic material elements expressed in a host cell by transformation, transduction, or transfection into the host cell. Vectors are well known by a person skilled in the art, including, but not limited to plasmids, phages, cosmids, artificial chromosome such as yeast artificial chromosome (YAC), bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) or P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC); phage such as Î» phage or M13 phage and animal virus. The animal viruses that can be used as vectors, include, but are not limited to, retrovirus (including lentivirus), adenovius, adeno-associated virus, herpes virus (such as herpes simplex virus), pox virus, baculovirus, papillomavirus, papova virus (such as SV40). A vector may comprises multiple elements for controlling expression, including, but not limited to, a promoter sequence, a transcription initiation sequence, an enhancer sequence, a selection element and a reporter gene. In addition, a vector may comprise origin of replication.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">As used herein, the term âhost cellâ refers to a cell into which a vector can be introduced, including, but not limited to, prokaryotic cell such as <i>E. coli </i>or <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, and fungal cell such as yeast cell or <i>Aspergillus</i>, insect cell such as S2 <i>Drosophila </i>cell or Sf9, or animal cell such as fibroblast, CHO cell, COS cell, NSO cell, HeLa cell, BHK cell, HEK 293 cell or human cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">As used herein, the term âidentityâ refers to the match degree between two polypeptides or between two nucleic acids. When two sequences for comparison have the same base or amino acid monomer sub-unit at a certain site (e.g., each of two DNA molecules has an adenine at a certain site, or each of two polypeptides has a lysine at a certain site), the two molecules are identical at the site. The percent identity between two sequences is a function of the number of identical sites shared by the two sequences over the total number of sites for comparisonÃ100. For example, if 6 of 10 sites of two sequences are matched, these two sequences have an identity of 60%. For example, DNA sequences: CTGACT and CAGGTT share an identity of 50% (3 of 6 sites are matched). Generally, the comparison of two sequences is conducted in a manner to produce maximum identity. Such alignment can be conducted by using a computer program such as Align program (DNAstar, Inc.) which is based on the method of Needleman, et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 48:443-453, 1970). The percent identity between two amino acid sequences can be determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller (Comput. Appl. Biosci., 4:11-17 (1988)) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. In addition, the percentage of identity between two amino acid sequences can be determined by the algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (J. Mol. Biol. 48:444-453 (1970)) which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at http://www.gcg.com), using either a Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">As used herein, the term âconservative substitutionâ refers to amino acid substitutions which would not disadvantageously affect or change the essential properties of a protein/polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence. For example, a conservative substitution may be introduced by standard techniques known in the art such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Conservative amino acid substitutions include substitutions wherein an amino acid residue is substituted with another amino acid residue having a similar side chain, for example, a residue physically or functionally similar (such as, having similar size, shape, charge, chemical property including the capability of forming covalent bond or hydrogen bond, etc.) to the corresponding amino acid residue. The families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids having alkaline side chains (for example, lysine, arginine and histidine), amino acids having acidic side chains (for example, aspartic acid and glutamic acid), amino acids having uncharged polar side chains (for example, glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), amino acids having nonpolar side chains (for example, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), amino acids having Î²-branched side chains (such as threonine, valine, isoleucine) and amino acids having aromatic side chains (for example, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Therefore, a corresponding amino acid residue is preferably substituted with another amino acid residue from the same side-chain family. Methods for identifying amino acid conservative substitutions are well known in the art (see, for example, Brummell et al., Biochem. 32: 1180-1187 (1993); Kobayashi et al., Protein Eng. 12(10): 879-884 (1999); and Burks et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Set USA 94: 412-417 (1997), which are incorporated herein by reference).</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">As used herein, the term âimmunogenicityâ refers to ability of stimulating the formation of specific antibodies or sensitized lymphocytes in organisms. It not only refers to the property of an antigen to stimulate a specific immunocyte to activate, proliferate and differentiate so as to finally generate immunologic effector substance such as antibody and sensitized lymphocyte, but also refers to the specific immune response that antibody or sensitized T lymphocyte can be formed in immune system of an organism after stimulating the organism with an antigen. Immunogenicity is the most important property of an antigen. Whether an antigen can successfully induce the generation of an immune response in a host depends on three factors, properties of an antigen, reactivity of a host, and immunization means.</p>

      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0089">The epitopes recognized by such monoclonal antibodies are identical to, or overlap spacially with the epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibody E6F6, E7G11, G12F5 or E13C5, so that such monoclonal antibodies can reduce the binding of monoclonal antibody E6F6, E7G11, G12F5 or E13C5 to the epitope peptide according to the invention or HBsAg protein by at least 50%, preferably at least 60%, preferably at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, preferably at least 95% or preferably at least 99%.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0090">The ability of a monoclonal antibody to be tested to reduce the binding of a known monoclonal antibody to HBsAg protein can be determined by conventional methods, such as the methods described in Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988). One exemplary method comprises: pre-coating an antigen to a microwell plate, adding a series of diluted unlabelled antibodies to be tested together with a given concentration of a known labeled monoclonal antibody to the pre-coated microwell plate and conducing incubation, and then determining the number of the known antibodies bound to the plate in the presence of the differently diluted antibody to be tested, after washing. The stronger the ability of an antibody to be tested to compete with a known antibody for binding to an antigen that the known antibody binds to is, the weaker the ability of the known antibody to bind to the antigen is, and the less the known antibodies that are bound to the plate are. Generally, antigens are coated on a 96-well microwell plate, and a monoclonal antibody to be tested may be tested for its ability of blocking a known labeled monoclonal antibody by radioactive labelling method or enzyme labelling method.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0091">Monoclonal antibodies may be prepared by methods for preparing hybridomas reported by Kohler et al. (Nature 256: 495 (1975)). Firstly, mice or other suitable host animals are immunized by injection of immunogen (if necessary, adjuvants are added). The injection means of immunogens or adjuvants generally are subcutaneous multi-point injection or intraperitoneal injection. Pre-conjugation of immunogens to some known proteins (e.g. serum albumin) may promote immunogenicity of antigens in a host. Adjuvants may be Freund's adjuvant or MPL-TDM, etc. After immunization of animal, lymphocytes secreting antibodies that specifically bind to immunogen are produced in the animal. Lymphocytes of interest are collected and are fused to myeloma cells using a suitable fusion agent (such as PEG), thereby getting hybridoma cells (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103, Academic Press, 1996).</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0092">The hybridoma cells prepared above are seeded to a suitable culture medium and grow in the medium, and the culture medium comprises one or more substances capable of inhibiting growth of unfused, parent myeloma cells. For example, in the case of parent myeloma cells deficient in hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), growth of HGPRT-deficient cells is inhibited by the addition of substances such as hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymine (HAT culture medium) to the culture medium.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0093">Preferred myeloma cells should have a high fusion rate, stable ability of secreting antibodies, be sensitive to HAT culture medium, and the like. The first choice of myeloma cells is murine myeloma, such as MOP-21 and MC-11 mouse tumor derived cell line (THE Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA), and SP-2/0 or X63-Ag8-653 cell line (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. USA). In addition, human myeloma and human-mouse heterogenous myeloma cell lines may be used to prepare human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133: 3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987).</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0094">Culture media for growing hybridoma cells are used to detect the generation of monoclonal antibodies against specific antigens. The following methods may be used to determine the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced in hybridoma cells, immunoprecipitation or in vitro binding assays, such as Radioimmunoassay (RIA) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For example, Scatchard assay described in Munson et al., Anal. Biochem. 107: 220 (1980) may be used to determine the affinity of monoclonal antibodies.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0095">After determining the specificity, affinity and reactivity of antibodies produced in hybridomas, cell lines of interest may be subcloned by limiting dilution method described in Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103, Academic Press, 1996. A suitable culture medium may be DMEM or RPMI-1640, etc. In addition, hybridoma cells may grow in a form of ascites tumor in animal bodies.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0096">By using traditional methods for purifying immunoglobulins, such as Protein A agarose gel, hydroxyapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis and affinity chromatography, monoclonal antibodies secreted by subclone cells may be isolated from cell culture, ascites or serum.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0097">Monoclonal antibodies may be obtained by genetic engineering recombinant techniques.

      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0121">As compared to the prior art, the epitope peptide according to the invention and the recombinant protein comprising the epitope peptide has significant advantages.

      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">Preparation and Property Analysis of Mouse Monoclonal Antibodies</heading>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0145">Purpose: obtainment of mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for HBsAg</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0146">1.1 Preparation of Anti-HBsAg Mouse Monoclonal Antibodies</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0147">1.1.1 Immunization of Mice</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0148">1.1.1.1 Preparation of immunogen: immunogen was a recombinant HBV surface antigen protein expressed by CHO (HBsAg, purchased from BEIJING WANTAI BIOLOGY PHARMACY CO., LTD.). The recombinant protein was diluted to a concentration of 0.4 mg/mL, and was mixed with an equivalent volume of Freund's adjuvant, to form a water-in-oil emulsion (a method for determining whether the mixed solution was completely emulsified: a drop of the mixed solution was dropped on the liquid surface of clean water, if the mixed solution aggregated and was not dispersed, it can be believed that the solution was substantially mixed homogeneously). Freund's complete adjuvant was used for primary immunization, and Freund's incomplete adjuvant was used for the subsequent boost immunization, no adjuvant was added for the last boost immunization which was conducted 72 h before fusion.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0149">1.1.1.2 Fundamental immunization of mice: 6-8 week old BALB/c female mice were immunized by subcutaneous multi-point injection of said immunogen at an amount of 400 Î¼L per mouse per time, and 200 Î¼L venous blood of eyeball was collected before each immunization, for titer assay. A boost immunization was performed every two weeks. Indirect ELISA was used to determine serum titer, and when the serum titer of mice was in plateau phase, immunization of mice was stopped and the fusion was performed after resting for 2 months.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0150">1.1.1.3 Final boost 72 h before fusion: final boost of spleen was performed 72 h before fusion of mouse spleen cell and mouse myeloma cell, the immunogen for this boost comprised no adjuvants, injection of 100 Î¼l 0.5 mg/mL recombinant protein was performed. Before immunization of spleen, mice were anaesthetized with ether, abdominal cavity was opened by cutting skin of abdominal wall to take spleen, the spleen was injected with 100 Î¼L antigen vertically, and the cut on skin of abdominal wall was rapidly sutured surgically.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0151">1.1.2 Preparation and Screening of Fused Hybridomas</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0152">After final boost which was conducted 72 h before fusion, mouse spleen was taken and was prepared into cell suspension and was subjected to cell fusion with mouse myeloma cells Sp2/0 to obtain hybridoma cells. Previous to this, feeder cells were prepared. During the culture of hybridoma cells, a large number of myeloma cells and splenocytes died one after another in 1640-HAT culture medium after fusion, a single cell or a few scattered cells were not easy to survive, and other cells had to be added to make them survive. The living cells added were known as feeder cells. The laboratory used mouse peritoneal macrophages or thymocytes of 13-day old mice as feeder cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0153">1.1.2.1 Preparation of mouse macrophages comprised the following steps. (i) A 6-week old BALB/c mouse was killed by cervical dislocation. The mouse was washed with running water, and bathed in 75% ethanol solution for 5 min; the mouse was placed on a superclean bench, with abdomen upward; skin of the mouse abdomen was lifted with a pair of tweezers; a small hole was cut; the skin was tore upward and downward with a bigger pair of tweezers to ensure sufficient explosure of abdomen. (ii) A pair of aseptic ophthalmic tweezers were used to lift the peritoneum, a small hole was cut in the middle of the peritoneum with another pair of scissors, 1 mL pipette was used to inject a suitable amount of culture medium into the abdominal cavity via the hole, the solution was stirred carefully with the pipette in the abdominal cavity, and the culture medium was sucked out and put in a centrifugation tube. (iii) The cell solution from the abdominal cavity was dissolved in HAT culture medium or HT culture medium, to get macrophagous feeder cells at a concentration of 2Ã105 cells/mL. (iv) 0.1 mL the feeder cells was added to each well of a 96-well cell culture plate, and was cultured in an incubator; or was added to a 96-well cell culture plate after mixing with fusion cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0154">1.1.2.2 Preparation of mouse thymocytes comprised the following steps. (i) A 13-week old BALB/c mouse was killed by cervical dislocation. The mouse was washed with running water and bathed in 75% ethanol solution for 5 min; the mouse was placed on a superclean bench, with abdomen upward. (ii) Skin of the mouse abdomen was lifted with a pair of tweezers, and the outer skin of abdomen and chest was cut. (iii) Another pair of clean scissors was used to cut the thoracic cavity, ivory-white thymus gland was taken out with a pair of tweezers, after grinding, the resultant mixture passed through a 200-mesh cell sieve to get a thymic feeder cell solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0155">1.1.2.3 Preparation of mouse myeloma cells comprising the following steps. (i) Mouse myeloma cell line Sp2/0-Ag14 (Sp2/0) was the most ideal fusion cell now as the cell line was easy to culture and has a high fusion rate; however, Sp2/0 myeloma cell line was more sensitive to the culture conditions as compared to NS-1, and did not grow well when it was over-diluted (at a density of less than 3Ã105/mL) and at basic pH (pH higher than 7.3). (ii) Cells in logarithmic growth phase were chosen for fusion. (iii) Before fusion, myeloma cells were removed from culture flask to a centrifugation tube, and were washed with RPMI-1640 culture medium for three times (1000 rpmÃ5 min); the cells were re-suspended in RPMI-1640 culture medium, and the cells were counted. (iv) Generally, mouse myeloma cells were thawn 5 days before fusion, and about 6 bottles of 35 cm2 Sp2/0 cells were needed for each fusion.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0156">1.1.2.4 Preparation of immunological splenocyte comprised the following steps. (i) BALB/C mice to be fused were used, the eyeballs were removed and the mice bled to death, the collected blood was used to prepare antiserum, which was used as positive control for antibody detection. The mice were washed with running water and bathed in 75% ethanol solution for 5 min; and the mice was placed on a superclean bench, with right arm recumbent. (ii) Abdominal cavity was opened and spleen was taken out by aseptic operation, the spleen was cut into small pieces, and the small pieces were placed on a 200-mesh cell sieve and were squeezed and ground by a grinding rod (plunger) whilst adding RPMI-1640 culture medium dropwise with a blowpipe. (iii) A suitable amount of RPMI-1640 culture medium was added, and the mixture was kept standing for 3-5 min, the upper 2/3 of the suspension was removed to a 50 mL plastic centrifugation tube; the operation was repeated for 2-3 times. (iv) The cells were washed with RPMI-1640 culture medium for three times (1000 rpmÃ10 min). (v) The cells were re-suspended in RPMI-1640 culture medium, and the number of cells was counted.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0157">1.1.2.5 The preparation of hybridomas by fusion using PEG fusogen comprised the following steps. (i) Before fusion, 1 mL PEG-1500 and 10 mL RPMI-1640 serum-free culture medium and 200 mL complete medium were pre-heated to 37Â° C. (ii) The prepared myeloma cells and splenocytes were mixed in a 50 mL centrifuge tube (1Ã108 splenocytes+1Ã107 myeloma cells, about 10:1), and were centrifugated at 1500 rpmÃ8 min; after centrifugation, the tube was flicked at the bottom to make the cells loose and be paste. (iii) 1 mL suction pipet was used to remove 0.8 mL (1Ã108 splenocytes+0.8 mL PEG) to a centrifugation tube under slight stirring, and the addition of PEG was finished within 60 s, followed by the addition of 10 mL RPMI-1640 complete medium that was preheated to 37Â° C., under mild stirring. Finally, RPMI-1640 culture medium was added to 40 mL, and centrifugation at 1000 rpmÃ5 min was performed. (iv) The supernatant was discarded, and a few amount of HT culture medium was used to blow off the cells carefully, and the cells were removed to a prepared HT culture medium and were added to a 96-well cell culture plate, at 0.1 mL per well; and were cultured in a CO2 incubator. (v) After 12 h, a suitable amount of HAT complete medium was prepared, and 0.1 mL of the medium was added to each well; 5 days later, HT complete medium was used to replace 50-100% of the cell supernatant in wells; about 9-14 days later, the supernatant was taken for detection.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0158">1.1.2.6 Screening of hybridomas: by indirect ELISA screening, the plate was coated with the recombinant antigen HBsAg at 100 ng/well, 50 uL cell supernant was added, and positive clone wells were picked.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0159">1.1.2.7 Cloning of hybridoma cells: limiting dilution assay was used, cells were firstly diluted to a given concentration gradient, and then were seeded to each well of a 96-well cell culture plate, with one cell grew in each well as far as possible. Hybridoma monoclonal positive cell line generally had to be cloned repeatedly for 2-3 times, and was regarded as stable clone line until 100% positive was reached.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0160">1.1.3 Production of MAb Ascites</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0161">2-3 BALB/c mice were used, and 0.5 mL saxol was injected to abdominal cavity. After 1 week, hybridoma cells in logarithmic growth phase were centrifugated at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The hybridoma cells were suspended in serum-free culture medium, and the number of cells was adjusted to (1-2)Ã106/mL, and 0.5 mL of the suspension was injected to abdominal cavity of each mouse. 7-10 d later, mice were killed by cervical dislocation when the abdominal cavity was inflated obviously. The mice were washed with running water, embathed, and bathed in 75% ethanol for 5 min. The abdomen of the mouse was upward, and the four limbs were fixed onto a dissecting table with syringe needles. Skin of the mouse abdomen was lifted with a pair of tweezers, a small hole was cut, and then the skin was cut from both sides to dorsum of the mouse. The skin was tore upward and downward with a bigger pair of tweezers to ensure sufficient explosure of abdomen. A pair of aspectic ophthalmic tweezers was used to lift the peritoneum, a small hole was cut in the middle of the peritoneum, and then 1 mL pipette was used to take all the ascites from the abdominal cavity. The ascites collected was mixed and centrifugated in a centrifuge tube at 3000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation.</p>

      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0208">When HBcAg was used as a carrier protein, full-length HBcAg protein or a fragment thereof (e.g., N-terminal aa 1-149 of HBcAg protein) might be used (see, Yang Haijie et al., Construction of Peptide Display Vector Based on HBV Core Protein, JOURNAL OF XIAMEN UNIVERSITY(NATURAL SCIENCE), 2004.05, Vol. 43, No. 4). In this experiment, a fragment of HBcAg protein (aa 1-149) was used as a carrier protein to construct a series of clones.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0209">The sequence encoding HBcAg aa79-81 was deleted from the nucleotide sequence encoding a fragment of HBcAg protein (aa 1-149) by site-directed mutagenesis, two linkers were separately introduced to the two ends of the deletion, BamH I/EcoR I digestion site was designed between the two linkers, and thus the sequence encoding the carrier protein C149/mut (the amino acid sequence of C149/mut was set forth in SEQ ID NO: 43, with a structure of HBc (1-78)-G4SG4T-GS-G4SG4-HBc (82-149); in C149/mut, 3 amino acids (aa 79-81) of HBcAg were replaced with the flexible linker rich in Gly, G4SG4T-GS-G4SG4) was obtained. The sequence encoding C149/mut was cloned into pTO-T7 prokaryotic expression vector (Luo Wenxin, et al., Chinese Journal of Biotechnology, 2000, 16:53-57), to get the recombinant plasmid pC149/mut, which encoded the protein C149/mut. Later, by using BamH I/EcoR I digestion site, the sequence encoding the polypeptide of interest (represented by SEQ in <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>) was cloned between the flexible linkers to obtain the recombinant vector pC149-SEQ, which encoded the recombinant protein C149-SEQ (comprising the carrier protein C149/mut and the polypeptide of interest SEQ). The clone design and structure of the recombinant vector pC149-SEQ were shown in <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>.</p>

      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0212">Expression and purification of a recombinant protein were described by using C149-SEQ6 as an example.</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0213">(6.2.1) Obtainment of high-efficiency expression strains: according to the method described in 6.1, the vector of interest pC149-SEQ6 was constructed, after identification with DNA sequencing, the vector of interest was transformed into <i>E. coli </i>ER2566 strain (<i>E. coli</i>, ER2566), to get an expression strain.</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0214">(6.2.2) Expression of C149-SEQ6 protein: the expression strain was seeded to a triangular flask (500 mL), and was cultured in a shaking table at 37Â° C. until OD was about 1.0. Isopropyl Î²-D-Thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, the expression was induced under shaking at 25Â° C. for 6 h.</p>

      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0216">(6.2.3.1) Ultrasonication of bacteria: bacteria in 6.2.2 were collected by centrifugation; bacteria were subjected to ultrasonication, the ultrasonication buffer comprising the components: 20 mM phosphate buffer (PH6.0)+300 mM NaCl.</p>
      <p id="p-00205-en" num="0217">(6.2.3.2) Primary purification of proteins of interest: since proteins of interest were thermotolerant, the ultrasonated mixture was put in water bath at 65Â° C. for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation. The supernant was added to a saturated ammonium sulfate solution at a volume ratio of 1:1, and the precipitate was collected after centrifugation. An appropriate volume of buffer was added to resuspend the precipitate to get primarily purified proteins of interest, wherein the buffer comprised 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH=7.4)+150 mM NaCl.</p>
      <p id="p-00206-en" num="0218">(6.2.3.3) Chromatographic purification of proteins of interest: the proteins obtained in 6.2.3.2 were further purified by Sepharose 4FF (GE) molecular sieve column chromatography to obtain the purified proteins of interest. The purified proteins of interest were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the assembly state of the particles of the proteins of interest was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM).</p>

      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0226">The ELISA results in 6.2.2 were shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>. The results indicated that HBs-E6F6, HBs-E7G11, HBs-G12F5, HBs-E13C5 had good reactivity with the recombinant proteins presenting polypeptides SEQ1, SEQ3, SEQ4, SEQ5, SEQ6, SEQ10, but had no reactivity with the recombinant proteins presenting polypeptides SEQ8, SEQ9, SEQ11. The sequence analysis of these polypeptides showed that the common feature of the polypeptides SEQ1, SEQ3, SEQ4, SEQ5, SEQ6, SEQ10 lies in comprising HBsAg aa121-aa124, and the common feature of SEQ8, SEQ9, SEQ11 resided in not comprising an intact HBsAg aa121-124. Therefore, it could be concluded that HBs-E6F6, HBs-E7G11, HBs-G12F5, HBs-E13C5 recognized the same epitope, and the amino acid sequence of the shortest epitope recognized by them was HBsAg aa121-124, i.e. CKTC. ELISA results showed that the recombinant proteins C149-SEQ1 and 3-6 had comparable reactivity with antibodies, and had reactivity higher than C149-SEQ10. Therefore, the polypeptides SEQ1 and 3-6 were the preferred epitope peptides recognized by antibodies HBs-E6F6, HBs-E7G11, HBs-G12F5, HBs-E13C5. In addition, since the sequence of SEQ1 was shorter than SEQ3-6, SEQ1 was regarded as the preferred core epitope.</p>
