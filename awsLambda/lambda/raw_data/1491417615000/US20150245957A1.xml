      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to an absorbent article.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In an absorbent article, such as a sanitary napkin or panty liner, liquid excreta, such as menstrual blood penetrates the liquid-permeable layer, such as the top sheet, and is absorbed and retained by the absorbent body, but due to the high viscosity of menstrual blood it tends to remain in the liquid-permeable layer. When menstrual blood remains in the liquid-permeable layer of an absorbent article, it produces a feeling of stickiness and visual discomfort for the wearer, and it has therefore been a goal to improve the migration of menstrual blood from the liquid-permeable layer to the absorbent body and reduce residual menstrual blood in the liquid-permeable layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Menstrual blood during menstruation, in particular, can also contain components of the endometrium which are highly viscous, and the top sheet preferably remains smooth and stick-free even after absorption of such highly viscous menstrual blood. Highly viscous menstrual blood usually remains on the top sheet in the form of masses, generally leaving the user with a visually unpleasant image, and therefore from this viewpoint as well it is preferred for no highly viscous menstrual blood to remain on the top sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Absorbent articles are known in the technical field which are coated with lotion compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">For example, PTL 1 discloses an absorbent article having a polypropylene glycol material-containing lotion composition situated on the inner surface of the top sheet (the clothing side surface), the inner surface of the back sheet (the body side surface), and on the base material between the inner surface of the top sheet and the inner surface of the back sheet. Also, PTL 2 discloses an absorbent article wherein a polypropylene glycol material-containing lotion composition is applied on the outer surface of the top sheet (body side surface).</p>

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an absorbent article having improved migration of menstrual blood from the top sheet to the absorbent body, and reduced residue of menstrual blood in the top sheet.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In order to solve the problems described above, the invention provides an absorbent article having a liquid-permeable top sheet, a liquid-impermeable back sheet and an absorbent body between the top sheet and the back sheet,</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">wherein the absorbent body is subjected to embossing from the surface facing the back sheet of the absorbent body, a plurality of recesses are formed on the surface facing the back sheet and a dense/sparse structure is formed across the in-plane direction of the absorbent body, while the absorbent body is embossed together with the top sheet from the surface facing the top sheet of the absorbent body, the top sheet and the absorbent body are integrally compressed at the center section in the widthwise direction in the excretory opening contact region on the surface facing the top sheet, forming a plurality of pressure bonded sections where the entirety of the top sheet in the thickness direction introverts into the absorbent body, and the absorbent body and the top sheet are contacted at least in the excretory opening contact region on the surface facing the top sheet,</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">the pressure bonded sections having linear shapes extending in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent article and the pressure bonded sections being formed in a discontinuous manner at prescribed spacings in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent article and being formed in rows at prescribed spacings in the widthwise direction of the absorbent article, the recesses being formed on the surface facing the back sheet of the absorbent body below the pressure bonded sections, the excretory opening contact region of the top sheet and the pressure bonded sections each containing a blood slipping agent with a kinematic viscosity of 0.01 to 80 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at 400Â° C., a water holding percentage of 0.01 to 4.0 mass % and a weight-average molecular weight of less than 1,000, and the amount of blood slipping agent in the pressure bonded sections being greater than the amount of blood slipping agent in the excretory opening contact region.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In the absorbent article of the invention, menstrual blood excreted by the wearer and reaching the excretory opening contact region slips down together with the blood slipping agent present in the excretory opening contact region of the top sheet and the pressure bonded sections, and migrates through the top sheet into the absorbent body. Therefore, the absorbent article of the invention has improved migration of menstrual blood from the top sheet to the absorbent body, and can reduce residue of menstrual blood in the top sheet. This prevents the skin contact surface of the top sheet from having a sticky feel, and maintains a smooth feel. This function and effect of the blood slipping agent is exhibited regardless of changes in menstrual blood discharge during menstruation (that is, whether the amount of discharged menstrual blood is large or small).</p>

      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="1">Definitions</heading>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Some of the terms used throughout the present specification will now be defined.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">âExcretory Opening Contact Regionâ</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">As used herein, âexcretory opening contact regionâ of the top sheet means the region of the top sheet that contacts with the excretory opening (labia minora, etc.) of the wearer. The excretory opening contact region will have a different location depending on the size of the absorbent article, and for an absorbent article with side flaps, the excretory opening contact region will usually be the inner side of the region defined by embossing disposed in a continuous or discontinuous manner surrounding a lengthwise line running through the widthwise center of the absorbent article, and the intersection with a widthwise line running through the lengthwise centers of both wing sections. Also, in the case of an absorbent article without side flaps, usually the excretory opening contact region is defined by embossing that is disposed continuously or discontinuously surrounding the widthwise center section and the lengthwise center section of the absorbent article.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The absorbent article of the invention may further comprise a second sheet between the top sheet and absorbent body, in addition to the top sheet, in which case the second sheet may have an excretory opening contact region. In this case, the excretory opening contact region of the second sheet is the region overlapping with the excretory opening contact region of the top sheet in the thickness direction of the absorbent article.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">âFrontâ and âBackâ</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Throughout the present specification, âfrontâ and âbackâ are in reference to the wearer, and mean the front of the wearer and the back of the wearer, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">âSkin Side Surfaceâ and âClothing Side Surfaceâ</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The âskin side surfaceâ, as it relates to the liquid-permeable top sheet and second sheet, means the surface that faces the skin side of the wearer when the article is worn. Similarly, the âclothing side surfaceâ means the surface that faces the clothing side of the wearer when the article is worn. For example, the clothing side surfaces of the top sheet and second sheet are, respectively, the surfaces of the top sheet and second sheet on the back sheet side. Also, the skin side surface of the top sheet has the same definition as âskin contact surfaceâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">âBlood Slipping Agent-Containing Regionâ</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">As used herein, the âblood slipping agent-containing regionâ as it relates to the top sheet means the region of the top sheet containing the blood slipping agent within the excretory opening contact region. The top sheet may have a blood slipping agent-containing region on a portion of the excretory opening contact region, or it may have the blood slipping agent-containing region across the entire excretory opening contact region. Furthermore, the top sheet may also have the blood slipping agent-containing region in the excretory opening non-contact region, exceeding the excretory opening contact region.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Also, throughout the present specification, the second sheet may have a blood slipping agent-containing region. The âblood slipping agent-containing regionâ as it relates to the second sheet, means the region of the second sheet containing the blood slipping agent within the excretory opening contact region, similar to the top sheet, and the second sheet may have the blood slipping agent-containing region in a portion or the entirety of the excretory opening contact region, while it may also have the blood slipping agent-containing region in the excretory opening non-contact region.</p>
      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="2">&lt;Absorbent Article&gt;</heading>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The absorbent article of the invention will now be explained in detail.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The absorbent article of the invention has a liquid-permeable top sheet, a liquid-impermeable back sheet and an absorbent body between the top sheet and the back sheet, wherein the absorbent body is subjected to embossing from the surface facing the back sheet of the absorbent body, a plurality of recesses are formed on the surface facing the back sheet and a dense/sparse structure is formed across the in-plane direction of the absorbent body, while the absorbent body is embossed together with the top sheet from the surface facing the top sheet of the absorbent body, the top sheet and the absorbent body are integrally compressed at the center section in the widthwise direction in the excretory opening contact region on the surface facing the top sheet, forming a plurality of pressure bonded sections where the entirety of the top sheet in the thickness direction introverts into the absorbent body, and the absorbent body and the top sheet are contacted at least in the excretory opening contact region on the surface facing the top sheet, the pressure bonded sections extending in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent article and the pressure bonded sections being formed in a discontinuous manner at prescribed spacings in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent article and being formed in rows at prescribed spacings in the widthwise direction of the absorbent article, the recesses being formed on the surface facing the back sheet of the absorbent body below the pressure bonded sections, the excretory opening contact region of the top sheet and the pressure bonded sections each containing a blood slipping agent with a kinematic viscosity of 0.01 to 80 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at 40Â° C., a water holding percentage of 0.01 to 4.0 mass % and a weight-average molecular weight of less than 1,000, and the amount of blood slipping agent in the pressure bonded sections being greater than the amount of blood slipping agent in the excretory opening contact region.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In the absorbent article of the invention, because of the blood slipping agent present in the pressure bonded sections and the shapes of the pressure bonded sections extending in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent article, when menstrual blood discharged from the excretory opening contact region attempts to flow in the widthwise direction of the absorbent article, the menstrual blood does not stop at the pressure bonded section but is repelled, and the menstrual blood is guided in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent article, thus allowing menstrual blood to be absorbed while efficiently using the absorbent body. Also, although menstrual blood tends to pool at the pressure bonded sections, the presence of the blood slipping agent allows the menstrual blood to migrate into the absorbent body without stopping at the top sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The pressure bonded sections of the absorbent article of the invention contain the blood slipping agent at a basis weight of preferably 1 to 30 g/m<sup>2</sup>, more preferably 2 to 20 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and even more preferably 3 to 10 g/m<sup>2</sup>. The excretory opening contact region of the top sheet contains the blood slipping agent at a basis weight of preferably 0.01 to 20 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and more preferably 0.1 to 10 g/m<sup>2</sup>. However, the amount of blood slipping agent in the pressure bonded sections must be greater than the amount of blood slipping agent in the excretory opening contact region.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The pressure bonded sections of the absorbent article of the invention are not particularly restricted so long as they extend in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent article, and for example, they may be straight linear, dotted, dotted linear, creased linear, curved linear, polygonal, circular, rectangular, punched circular, rectangular or polygonal recesses connected in an essentially linear fashion as recess groups. When the pressure bonded sections are a plurality of dotted recesses connected in an essentially linear fashion as recess groups, each of the dotted recesses preferably have areas of 0.5 to 2.0 mm<sup>2 </sup>and especially 1 to 1.0 mm<sup>2</sup>. The distances between the dotted recesses are preferably no greater than 5 mm and especially no greater than 3 mm, from the viewpoint of effectively guiding fluid in the direction in which the pressure bonded sections extend.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The shapes of the recesses formed on the surface facing the back sheet of the absorbent body of the absorbent article of the invention may be any desired shapes, and for example, they may be polygonal, dotted, linear, ellipsoid, punched circular, wavy linear or the like. They may also be a pattern of these shapes in any desired combination of two or more.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In the absorbent article of the invention, the embossed sections are provided surrounding the excretory opening contact region, the embossed sections preferably containing a blood slipping agent. If embossed sections are present around the excretory opening contact region and the embossed sections also contain a blood slipping agent, then it will be possible to cause menstrual blood to diffuse along the embossed sections around the excretory opening contact region while pushing back menstrual blood that has flowed over the pressure bonded sections in the widthwise direction of the absorbent article, thus exhibiting a greater effect of preventing side leakage.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In the absorbent article of the invention, the top sheet has a plurality of projections on the skin side surface of the top sheet, and the clothing side surface of the top sheet is preferably flatter than the skin side surface of the top sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In the absorbent article of the invention, the top sheet preferably has a gradually densifying structure from the skin side surface of the top sheet toward the clothing side surface of the top sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In the absorbent article of the invention, the top sheet also preferably has gradually increasing hydrophilicity from the skin side surface of the top sheet toward the clothing side surface of the top sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The top sheet in the absorbent article of the invention also preferably has stretchability.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In the absorbent article of the invention, the total ratio of the area of the recesses with respect to the surface facing the back sheet of the absorbent body is preferably higher than the total ratio of the area of the pressure bonded sections with respect to the surface facing the top sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In the absorbent article of the invention, the recesses formed on the surface facing the back sheet of the absorbent body are preferably dotted recesses.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In both the lengthwise direction and/or the widthwise direction of the absorbent article of the invention, preferably the pitch between the pressure bonded sections formed on the surface facing the top sheet is greater than the pitch between the recesses formed on the surface facing the back sheet of the absorbent body.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In the absorbent article of the invention, preferably the total ratio of the area of the recesses with respect to the surface facing the back sheet of the absorbent body is between 1 and 50%, the pitch between the recesses in the lengthwise direction is 3 to 10 mm, and the pitch in the widthwise direction is 3 to 10 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In the absorbent article of the invention, preferably the total ratio of the area of the pressure bonded sections with respect to the surface facing the top sheet of the absorbent body is between 0.01 and 2.0%, the area of each of the pressure bonded sections is 1 to 20 mm<sup>2</sup>, the pitch between the pressure bonded sections in the lengthwise direction is 5 to 50 mm, and the pitch in the widthwise direction is 5 to 30 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In the absorbent article of the invention, the IOB of the blood slipping agent is preferably an IOB of 0.00 to 0.60.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In the absorbent article of the invention, preferably the blood slipping agent is selected from the group consisting of following items (i) to (iii), and any combination thereof:</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">(i) a hydrocarbon;</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">(ii) a compound having (ii-1) a hydrocarbon moiety and (ii-2) one or more, same or different groups selected from the group consisting of carbonyl group (âCOâ) and oxy group (âOâ) inserted between a CâC single bond of the hydrocarbon moiety; and</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">(iii) a compound having (iii-1) a hydrocarbon moiety, (iii-2) one or more, same or different groups selected from the group consisting of carbonyl group (âCOâ) and oxy group (âOâ), inserted between a CâC single bond of the hydrocarbon moiety, and (iii-3) one or more, same or different groups selected from the group consisting of carboxyl group (âCOOH) and hydroxyl group (âOH), substituting a hydrogen on the hydrocarbon moiety;</p>

      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">The blood slipping agent contained in the absorbent article of the invention will now be described. The blood slipping agent has a kinematic viscosity of about 0.01 to about 80 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at 40Â° C., a water holding percentage of about 0.05 to about 4.0 mass %, and a weight-average molecular weight of less than about 1,000.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The 40Â° C. kinematic viscosity of the blood slipping agent may be appropriately adjusted in the range of about 0 to about 80 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, but it is preferably about 1 to about 70 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, more preferably about 3 to about 60 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, even more preferably about 5 to about 50 mm<sup>2</sup>/s and yet more preferably about 7 to about 45 mm<sup>2</sup>/s. As used herein, the â40Â° C. kinematic viscosityâ may be referred to simply as âkinematic viscosityâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The kinematic viscosity tends to be higher with a) a larger molecular weight of the blood slipping agent, b) a higher percentage of polar groups, such as carbonyl bonds (âCOâ), ether bonds (âOâ), carboxyl groups (âCOOH) and hydroxyl groups (âOH), and c) a larger IOB.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">In order to have a kinematic viscosity of about 0 to about 80 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at 40Â° C., the melting point of the blood slipping agent is preferably no higher than 45Â° C. This is because the kinematic viscosity will tend to be higher if the blood slipping agent contains crystals at 40Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The significance of the kinematic viscosity of the blood slipping agent will be explained below, but a kinematic viscosity exceeding about 80 mm<sup>2</sup>/s will tend to result in high viscosity of the blood slipping agent, such that it will not as easily slip down from the projections to the recesses together with menstrual blood that has reached the skin contact surface of the top sheet, and subsequently migrate into the absorbent body.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The kinematic viscosity can be measured according to JIS K 2283:2000, â5. Kinematic Viscosity Test Methodâ, using a Cannon-Fenske reverse-flow viscometer, at a testing temperature of 40Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The water holding percentage of the blood slipping agent may be appropriately adjusted in the range of about 0.01 to about 4.0 mass %, but it is preferably about 0.02 to about 3.5 mass %, more preferably about 0.03 to about 3.0 mass %, even more preferably about 0.04 to about 2.5 mass % and yet more preferably about 0.05 to about 2.0 mass %.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">As used herein, âwater holding percentageâ means the percentage (mass) of water that can be held by a substance, and it may be measured in the following manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">(1) A 20 mL test tube, a rubber stopper, the substance to be measured and deionized water are allowed to stand for a day and a night in a thermostatic chamber at 40Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">(2) Into the test tube in the thermostatic chamber there are charged 5.0 g of the substance to be measured and 5.0 g of deionized water.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">(3) The mouth of the test tube is closed with the rubber stopper in the thermostatic chamber, and the test tube is rotated once and allowed to stand for 5 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">(4) A 3.0 g portion of the layer of the substance to be measured (usually the upper layer) is sampled into a glass dish with a diameter of 90 mm and a mass of W<sub>0 </sub>(g), in the thermostatic chamber.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">(5) The dish is heated at 105Â° C. for 3 hours in an oven to evaporate off the moisture, and the mass W<sub>1 </sub>(g) of each dish is measured.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">(6) The water holding percentage is calculated by the following formula.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">Water holding percentage (mass %)=100Ã[W<sub>0 </sub>(g)âW<sub>1 </sub>(g)]/3.0 (g)</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">The measurement is conducted three times, and the average value is recorded.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">The significance of the water holding percentage of the blood slipping agent will be explained below, but a low water holding percentage will tend to lower the affinity between the blood slipping agent and menstrual blood, thus impeding its migration into the absorbent body together with menstrual blood that has reached the skin contact surface of the top sheet. If the water holding percentage is high, on the other hand, the affinity between menstrual blood and the blood modifying agent will become very high, similar to a surfactant, and absorbed menstrual blood will tend to remain on the skin contact surface of the top sheet, resulting in more red coloration of the skin contact surface of the top sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">The water holding percentage tends to be a larger value with a) a smaller molecular weight of the blood slipping agent, and b) a higher percentage of polar groups, such as carbonyl bonds (âCOâ), ether bonds (âOâ), carboxyl groups (âCOOH) and hydroxyl groups (âOH). This is because the blood slipping agent has greater hydrophilicity. The water holding percentage will tend to have a larger value with a greater IOB, i.e with a higher inorganic value or with a lower organic value. This is also because the blood slipping agent has greater hydrophilicity.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">The significance of the kinematic viscosity and water holding percentage of the blood slipping agent will now be explained.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">Menstrual blood excreted by the wearer and reaching the excretory opening contact region contacts the blood slipping agent in the projections and slips down together with it into the recesses, passing through the top sheet and migrating into the absorbent body.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">More specifically, since the blood slipping agent with a kinematic viscosity of about 0.01 to about 80 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at 40Â° C. has very low viscosity near the body temperature of the wearer and has a constant affinity with the menstrual blood, it slips down from the projections to the recesses together with the menstrual blood, and utilizing the energy during sliding, the menstrual blood is able to pass through the recesses of the top sheet to rapidly migrate into the absorbent body. Also, since the blood slipping agent present in the projections has a water holding percentage of about 0.01 to about 4.0 mass %, presumably it has no affinity with the hydrophilic component (blood plasma, etc.) in the menstrual blood, and therefore the menstrual blood does not easily remain on the top sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">When the menstrual blood discharged by the wearer is a large amount of menstrual blood, the menstrual blood easily migrates into the absorbent body, even when the kinetic energy of the menstrual blood itself is high and the kinematic viscosity of the blood slipping agent is relatively high so that it does not easily slip down together with the menstrual blood, or when the water holding percentage value is relatively high so that affinity with the hydrophilic components of the menstrual blood is high, or when the weight-average molecular weight value is relatively high so that it does not easily slip down together with the menstrual blood, or when the skin contact surface of the top sheet does not have an irregular structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">When the menstrual blood discharge by the wearer is a small amount of menstrual blood, on the other hand, the kinetic energy of the menstrual blood is low, and menstrual blood that has reached the skin contact surface of the top sheet tends to easily pool in such cases. Consequently, the blood slipping agent slips down from the projections into the recesses together with the menstrual blood, and the menstrual blood is drawn into the top sheet and then drawn into the absorbent body, so that the menstrual blood can rapidly migrate into the absorbent body.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">The blood slipping agent has a weight-average molecular weight of less than about 1,000, and preferably a weight-average molecular weight of less than about 900. This is because if the weight-average molecular weight is about 1,000 or higher, tack may be produced in the blood slipping agent itself, tending to create a feeling of discomfort for the wearer. If the weight-average molecular weight increases, the viscosity of the blood slipping agent will tend to increase, and it will therefore be difficult to lower the viscosity of the blood slipping agent by heating to a viscosity suitable for coating, and as a result, the blood slipping agent may need to be diluted with a solvent.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">The blood slipping agent preferably has a weight-average molecular weight of about 100 or greater, and more preferably it has a weight-average molecular weight of about 200 or greater. This is because if the weight-average molecular weight is low, the vapor pressure of the blood slipping agent may be increased, gasification may occur during storage and the amount may be reduced, often leading to problems, such as odor during wear.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">As used herein, âweight-average molecular weightâ includes the concept of a polydisperse compound (for example, a compound produced by stepwise polymerization, an ester formed from a plurality of fatty acids and a plurality of aliphatic monohydric alcohols), and a simple compound (for example, an ester formed from one fatty acid and one aliphatic monohydric alcohol), and in a system comprising N<sub>i </sub>molecules with molecular weight M<sub>i </sub>(i=1, or i=1, 2 . . . ), it refers to M<sub>w </sub>determined by the following formula.</p>

      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0101">For example, in the case of an ester of tetradecanoic acid which has 14 carbon atoms and dodecyl alcohol which has 12 carbon atoms, the organic value is 520 (CH<sub>2</sub>, 20Ã26) and the inorganic value is 60 (âCOOR, 60Ã1), and therefore IOB=0.12.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0102">The IOB of the blood slipping agent is preferably between about 0.00 and 0.60, more preferably between about 0.00 and 0.50, even more preferably between about 0.00 and 0.40 and most preferably between about 0.00 and 0.30. If the IOB is within this range, it will be easier to meet the aforementioned conditions for the water-holding capacity and kinematic viscosity.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0103">The blood slipping agent preferably has a melting point of no higher than 45Â° C., and more preferably it has a melting point of no higher than 40Â° C. If the blood slipping agent has a melting point of no higher than 45Â° C., the blood slipping agent will more easily exhibit a kinematic viscosity in the aforementioned range.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0104">As used herein, the term âmelting pointâ refers to the peak top temperature for the endothermic peak during conversion from solid to liquid, upon measurement with a differential scanning calorimetry analyzer at a temperature-elevating rate of 10Â° C./min. The melting point may be measured using a Model DSC-60 DSC measuring apparatus by Shimadzu Corp., for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0105">If the blood slipping agent has a melting point of no higher than about 45Â° C., it may be either liquid or solid at room temperature (about 25Â° C.), or in other words, the melting point may be either about 25Â° C. or higher or below about 25Â° C., and for example, it may have a melting point of about â5Â° C. or about â20Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0106">The blood slipping agent does not have a lower limit for its melting point, but its vapor pressure is preferably low. The vapor pressure of the blood slipping agent is preferably between about 0 and about 200 Pa, more preferably between about 0 and about 100 Pa, more preferably between about 0 and about 10 Pa, even more preferably between about 0 and about 1 Pa and yet more preferably between about 0.0 and about 0.1 Pa, at 25Â° C. (1 atmosphere).</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0107">Considering that the absorbent article of the invention is to be used in contact with the human body, the vapor pressure is preferably between about 0 and about 700 Pa, more preferably between about 0 and about 100 Pa, more preferably between about 0 and about 10 Pa, even more preferably between about 0 and about 1 Pa and yet more preferably between about 0.0 and about 0.1 Pa, at 40Â° C. (1 atmosphere). If the vapor pressure of the blood slipping agent is high, gasification may occur during storage and the amount may be reduced, often creating problems, such as odor during wear.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0108">The melting point of the blood slipping agent may be selected depending on the weather or duration of wear. For example, in regions with a mean atmospheric temperature of no higher than about 10Â° C., using a blood slipping agent with a melting point of no higher than about 10Â° C. may help the blood slipping agent function after excretion of menstrual blood, even if it has been cooled by the ambient temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0109">Also, when the absorbent article is to be used for a prolonged period of time, the melting point of the blood slipping agent is preferably at the high end of the range of no higher than about 45Â° C. This is so that the blood slipping agent will not be easily affected by sweat or friction during wearing, and will not easily become biased even during prolonged wearing.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0110">In the technical field, the skin contact surfaces of top sheets are coated with surfactants in order to alter the surface tension of menstrual blood and promote rapid absorption of menstrual blood. However, the top sheet coated with the surfactant has very high affinity for the hydrophilic components (blood plasma, etc.) in menstrual blood, and acts to attract them, tending to cause menstrual blood instead to remain on the top sheet. The blood slipping agent, unlike conventionally known surfactants, has low affinity with menstrual blood and therefore does not cause residue of menstrual blood on the top sheet and allows rapid migration into the absorbent body.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0111">The blood slipping agent is preferably selected from the group consisting of following items (i)-(iii), and any combination thereof:</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0112">(i) a hydrocarbon;</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0113">(ii) a compound having (ii-1) a hydrocarbon moiety, and (ii-2) one or more, same or different groups selected from the group consisting of carbonyl group (âCOâ) and oxy group (âOâ) inserted between a CâC single bond of the hydrocarbon moiety; and</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0114">(iii) a compound having (iii-1) a hydrocarbon moiety, (iii-2) one or more, same or different groups selected from the group consisting of carbonyl group (âCOâ) and oxy group (âOâ) inserted between a CâC single bond of the hydrocarbon moiety, and (iii-3) one or more, same or different groups selected from the group consisting of carboxyl group (âCOOH) and hydroxyl group (âOH) substituting for a hydrogen on the hydrocarbon moiety.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0115">As used herein, âhydrocarbonâ refers to a compound composed of carbon and hydrogen, and it may be a chain hydrocarbon, such as a paraffinic hydrocarbon (containing no double bond or triple bond, also referred to as âalkaneâ), an olefin-based hydrocarbon (containing one double bond, also referred to as âalkeneâ), an acetylene-based hydrocarbon (containing one triple bond, also referred to as âalkyneâ), or a hydrocarbon or cyclic hydrocarbon comprising two or more bonds selected from the group consisting of double bonds or triple bonds, such as aromatic hydrocarbons and alicyclic hydrocarbons.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0116">Preferred as such hydrocarbons are chain hydrocarbons and alicyclic hydrocarbons, with chain hydrocarbons being more preferred, paraffinic hydrocarbons, olefin-based hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons with two or more double bonds (containing no triple bond) being more preferred, and paraffinic hydrocarbons being even more preferred.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0117">Chain hydrocarbons include straight-chain hydrocarbons and branched-chain hydrocarbons.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0118">When two or more oxy groups (âOâ) are inserted in the compounds of (ii) and (iii) above, the oxy groups (âOâ) are not adjacent. Thus, compounds (ii) and (iii) do not include compounds with continuous oxy groups (i.e. peroxides).</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0119">In the compounds of (iii), compounds in which at least one hydrogen on the hydrocarbon moiety is substituted with a hydroxyl group (âOH) are preferred over compounds in which at least one hydrogen on the hydrocarbon moiety is substituted with a carboxyl group (âCOOH). This is because the carboxyl groups bond with metals and the like in menstrual blood, increasing the water holding percentage of the blood slipping agent, which may sometimes exceed the prescribed range. The same is true from the viewpoint of the IOB as well. As shown in Table 1, the carboxyl groups bond with metals and the like in menstrual blood, drastically increasing the inorganic value from 150 to 400 or greater, and therefore a blood slipping agent with carboxyl groups can increase the IOB value to more than about 0.60 during use.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0120">The blood slipping agent is more preferably selected from the group consisting of following items (iâ²)-(iiiâ²), and any combination thereof:</p>

This is because, if the weight-average molecular weight is about 1,000 or higher, tack may result in the blood slipping agent-containing composition itself, tending to create a feeling of unpleasantness for the wearer. If the weight-average molecular weight increases, the viscosity of the blood slipping agent-containing composition will tend to increase, and it will therefore be difficult to lower the viscosity of the blood slipping agent composition by heating to a viscosity suitable for coating, and as a result, the blood slipping agent may need to be diluted with a solvent.</p>

      <p id="p-00304-en" num="0267">A low water holding percentage value will tend to lower the affinity between the blood slipping agent composition and menstrual blood, thus inhibiting it from slipping down into the interior of the absorbent article with menstrual blood that has reached the skin contact surface of the top sheet.</p>

The pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> are formed in a discontinuous manner with prescribed spacings in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent article <b>1</b>. They are also formed in a plurality of rows with prescribed spacings in the widthwise direction of the absorbent article <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00313-en" num="0276">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the blood slipping agent-containing region <b>7</b> of the absorbent article <b>1</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, along cross-section X-X. As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the absorbent article <b>1</b> has pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> formed by integrally compressing the top sheet <b>2</b> and the absorbent body <b>3</b>, with a plurality of dotted recesses <b>10</b> formed on the surface facing the back sheet of the absorbent body <b>3</b>, the excretory opening contact region of the top sheet <b>2</b> and the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> each containing a blood slipping agent <b>11</b>, the amount of blood slipping agent <b>11</b> in the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> being greater than the amount of blood slipping agent in the excretory opening contact region.</p>
      <p id="p-00314-en" num="0277">The recesses <b>10</b> are preferably provided at least at the excretory opening-facing region on the surface facing the back sheet of the absorbent body <b>3</b>, and are formed on the absorbent article <b>1</b> across the entire surface facing the back sheet. The recesses <b>10</b> are formed by embossing of the absorbent body <b>3</b> from the surface facing the back sheet of the absorbent body <b>3</b>. However, the absorbent body <b>3</b> is not embossed from the surface facing the top sheet, except for the excretory opening-facing region described below. As a result, the surface facing the back sheet of the absorbent body <b>3</b> becomes an irregular surface, while the surface facing the top sheet is essentially a flat surface. In some cases, however, the surface facing the top sheet is slightly indented at the locations corresponding to the recesses <b>10</b>, depending on the embossing conditions during formation of the recesses <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00315-en" num="0278">The embossing for formation of the recesses <b>10</b> is carried out only on the absorbent body <b>3</b>. That is, the recesses <b>10</b> are not formed by embossing of the absorbent body <b>3</b> together with the top sheet <b>2</b> or back sheet <b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00316-en" num="0279">Also, by embossing the absorbent body <b>3</b> from the surface facing the back sheet, a dense/sparse structure is formed in the absorbent body <b>3</b> across the entire in-plane direction. Specifically a dense/sparse structure is formed comprising dense sections <b>3</b><i>a </i>that are compressed and sparse sections <b>3</b><i>b </i>that are in a non-compressed state. The dense sections <b>3</b><i>a </i>are located on the bottom sections of the recesses <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00317-en" num="0280">By forming a dense/sparse structure in the absorbent body <b>3</b>, it is possible to impart two functions to the absorbent body <b>3</b>. The first function is a function of increasing diffusibility of fluids due to the presence of the dense sections <b>3</b><i>a</i>. At the dense sections <b>3</b><i>a</i>, capillary force is strongly active causing rapid diffusion of fluid in the planar direction of the absorbent body <b>3</b>. The second function is a function of increasing permeability of fluids due to the presence of the sparse sections <b>3</b><i>b</i>. Since the sparse sections <b>3</b><i>b </i>have spaces through which fluid can easily pass, excreted fluid rapidly permeates in the thickness direction of the absorbent body <b>3</b>. These two functions ensure rapid permeation and diffusion of fluids, allowing sufficient diffusion of fluids in the planar direction within the absorbent body <b>3</b>, without leaving extra absorbing power throughout the absorbent body. As a result, the amount of pulp or super-absorbent polymer used can be reduced, without lowering the absorption volume. This is advantageous from the viewpoint of economy and of alleviating environmental load.</p>
      <p id="p-00318-en" num="0281">By forming a dense/sparse structure in the absorbent body <b>3</b>, the shape retention of the absorbent body <b>3</b> is increased and an effect is exhibited of minimizing twisting of the absorbent body <b>3</b> even when the wearer produces intense movement, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00319-en" num="0282">The recesses <b>10</b> preferably have an area of 0.5 to 15 mm<sup>2 </sup>and especially 1 to 10 mm<sup>2</sup>, from the viewpoint of allowing effective capillary force to be designed for fluid diffusion, and avoiding excessively high rigidity against bending of the napkin as a whole, or in other words, avoiding an uncomfortable feeling for the wearer or anxiety in regard to fitting. The recesses <b>10</b> preferably have shapes with low anisotropy, with an aspect ratio of nearly 1. For example, they may have polygonal shapes that are circular, rectangular or triangular. The total ratio of the area of the recesses <b>10</b> with respect to the surface facing the back sheet of the absorbent body <b>3</b> (hereunder referred to as âarea ratio on the surface facing the back sheetâ) is 1% to 50% and especially 2% to 30%, which is preferred from the viewpoint of allowing formation of the desired dense/sparse structure on the absorbent body <b>3</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00320-en" num="0283">The recesses <b>10</b> preferably have a pitch of 3 to 10 mm and especially 3 to 7 mm in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent article <b>1</b>, and a pitch of 3 to 10 mm and especially 3 to 7 mm in the widthwise direction of the absorbent article <b>1</b>, from the viewpoint of obtaining capillary force effective for fluid diffusion and spaces to facilitate fluid permeation, and of achieving rapid permeation and diffusion of fluids by these two functions to allow the absorbing power of the absorbent body as a whole to be exhibited without excess.</p>
      <p id="p-00321-en" num="0284">In order to provide recesses <b>10</b> on the surface facing the back of the absorbent body <b>3</b> sheet, a dense/sparse structure is formed in the absorbent body <b>3</b> while the surface facing the top sheet of the absorbent body <b>3</b> is essentially a flat surface. As a result, adhesiveness between the absorbent body <b>3</b> and the top sheet <b>2</b> is increased, and migration of fluid from the top sheet <b>2</b> to the absorbent body <b>3</b> is rendered even more rapid. From this viewpoint, as explained below, it is preferred for the clothing side surface of the top sheet <b>2</b> (that is, the surface facing the absorbent body) to be essentially flat.</p>
      <p id="p-00322-en" num="0285">The pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> are formed by integrally compressing the top sheet <b>2</b> and the absorbent body <b>3</b>. The pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> are formed by embossing of the absorbent body <b>3</b> together with the top sheet <b>2</b>, from the surface facing the top sheet of the absorbent body <b>3</b>. In the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b>, the top sheet <b>2</b> is pressed by an embossing pin (not shown), and the entirety of the top sheet <b>2</b> in the thickness direction introverts into the absorbent body <b>3</b>, while the top sheet <b>2</b> becomes bonded and fixed to the absorbent body <b>3</b> at the introverted sections. Thus, the top sheet <b>2</b> is fixed to the absorbent body <b>3</b> with tension between the pressure bonded sections. The action of the tension maintains satisfactory adhesiveness between the top sheet <b>2</b> and the absorbent body <b>3</b> even with deformation to the absorbent article <b>1</b> by movement of the body during wearing, and fluids excreted onto the top sheet <b>2</b> rapidly migrate into the absorbent body <b>3</b> and are absorbed. Joining of the top sheet <b>2</b> and the absorbent body <b>3</b> may also be accomplished by bonding between the constituent fibers using heat fusion or an adhesive.</p>
      <p id="p-00323-en" num="0286">High density/low density sections may also be alternatingly arranged in the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b>. This is effective for alleviating the rigid feel of the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b>, increasing the fitting property and increasing the attractive force for fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00324-en" num="0287">In addition, embossed sections <b>6</b>â² are formed across the entire surrounding portion outside the region in which the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> are formed, or continuous embossed sections <b>6</b>â² are formed on both the forward and rear or right and left sides of the region, such that the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> become positioned by the embossed sections <b>6</b>â² and the top sheet <b>2</b> and absorbent body <b>3</b> become even more closely adhered. As a result, migration of menstrual blood is promoted, and fluid leakage is minimized. The details regarding the embossed sections <b>6</b>â² will be explained below.</p>
      <p id="p-00325-en" num="0288">The arrangement pattern for the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> and the recesses <b>10</b> are not particularly restricted. As illustrated, the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> are arranged roughly longitudinally in the lengthwise direction of the product, further increasing the leakage-preventing effect. Also, while not shown here, the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> may be arranged roughly longitudinally in the widthwise direction of the product to promote bending of the product and increase the fitting property on the body. The recesses <b>10</b> may also be arranged regularly at equal spacings across the entire absorbent body, or they may be arranged as desired in the lengthwise direction and widthwise direction of the product.</p>
      <p id="p-00326-en" num="0289">There are no particular restrictions on the relative arrangement pattern of the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> and the recesses <b>10</b>, but it is particularly preferred to form a plurality of recesses <b>10</b> on the surface facing the back sheet of the absorbent body <b>3</b>, below the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b>, and to form a dense/sparse structure across the in-plane direction of the absorbent body <b>3</b>. This can further promote diffusibility of fluids in the absorbent body <b>3</b>. It also further promotes permeability of fluids in the absorbent body.</p>
      <p id="p-00327-en" num="0290">As explained below, since the top sheet <b>2</b> has stretchability and the top sheet <b>2</b> is integrated with the absorbent body <b>3</b> while stretching, bonding is produced to a deeper location in the thickness direction of the absorbent body <b>3</b>. Thus, adhesiveness between the top sheet <b>2</b> and the absorbent body <b>3</b> is further increased, and fluid excreted onto the top sheet <b>2</b> migrates even more rapidly through the pressure bonded sections into the absorbent body <b>3</b>. Furthermore, since the top sheet <b>2</b> is resistant to separation from the absorbent body <b>3</b> at the pressure bonded sections, the structural stability is excellent against bodily movement. In the absorbent article <b>1</b> of this embodiment, this effect can prevent fluid residue and fluid flow on the top sheet, exhibiting excellent absorption performance and leakproof performance, while also producing a comfortable feel during wear with reduced feeling of wetness.</p>
      <p id="p-00328-en" num="0291">For these reasons, the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> must be formed in the region of the absorbent article <b>1</b> facing the excretory opening, but more preferably the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> are formed only in the region facing the excretory opening. When the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> are formed over the entire absorbent article <b>1</b>, the fitting property of the absorbent article <b>1</b> decreases and leakage tends to occur, due to the increased rigidity of the absorbent article <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00329-en" num="0292">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> preferably extend in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent article <b>1</b>. This causes excreted fluid to be guided along the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> and flow in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent article <b>1</b>, preventing fluid leakage from the side sections of the absorbent article <b>1</b>. An additional advantage is that the fitting property is increased without losing flexibility in the widthwise direction of the absorbent article <b>1</b>. The lengths of the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> are preferably 5 to 20 mm and especially 5 to 10 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00330-en" num="0293">The area of the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> is preferably 1 to 20 mm<sup>2 </sup>and especially 5 to 10 mm<sup>2</sup>, from the viewpoint of allowing the fluid excreted onto the top sheet <b>2</b> to migrate more rapidly into the absorbent body <b>3</b>, and preventing separation of the top sheet <b>2</b> from the absorbent body. The total ratio of the area of the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> with respect to the surface facing the top sheet of the absorbent body <b>3</b> (hereunder referred to as âarea ratio on the surface facing the top sheetâ) is preferably a low value of 0.01% to 2.0% and especially 0.05% to 1.0%, which is preferred from the viewpoint of preventing excessive increase in rigidity of the absorbent body <b>3</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00331-en" num="0294">The pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> preferably have a pitch of 5 to 50 mm and especially 5 to 30 mm in the lengthwise direction of the absorbent article <b>1</b>, from the viewpoint of facilitating bending of the napkin as a whole, thus allowing the napkin to fit on the body more easily. Also, the pitch in the widthwise direction of the absorbent article <b>1</b> is preferably 5 to 30 mm and especially 5 to 20 mm from the viewpoint of satisfactory adhesiveness of the top sheet <b>2</b> to the absorbent body <b>3</b>, more rapid migration of excreted fluids to the absorbent body <b>3</b>, and avoiding rigidity that can create discomfort for the wearer.</p>
      <p id="p-00332-en" num="0295">In the absorbent article <b>1</b> of the invention, the area ratio on the surface facing the back sheet is higher than the area ratio on the surface facing the top sheet. This can satisfactorily increase attraction of fluids. From this viewpoint, the value of (area ratio on the surface facing the back sheet)/(area ratio on the surface facing the top sheet) is preferably 2-900 and especially 10-500. The actual values for the area ratio on the surface facing the back sheet and the area ratio on the surface facing the top sheet are as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00333-en" num="0296">For the same reason as for the area ratio, in both the lengthwise direction and/or the widthwise direction of the absorbent article <b>1</b> of the invention, preferably the pitch between the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> formed on the surface facing the top sheet is greater than the pitch between the recesses <b>10</b> formed on the surface facing the back sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00334-en" num="0297">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, embossed sections <b>6</b>â² are formed in the region of the absorbent article <b>1</b> facing the excretory opening, separately from the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b>. The embossed sections <b>6</b>â² are located on both sides of the center section of the region facing the excretory opening in which the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> are formed, and have closed shapes surrounding the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b>. The embossed sections <b>6</b>â² are formed by continuous bonding between the top sheet <b>2</b> and the absorbent body <b>3</b> on the skin contact surface side of the absorbent article <b>1</b>. The embossed sections <b>6</b>â² are also formed by embossing, similar to the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00335-en" num="0298">By having the embossed sections <b>6</b>â² formed outside of the side sections of the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b>, the top sheet <b>2</b> will become bonded with the absorbent body <b>3</b> while being stretched, not only between the pressure bonded sections but also between the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> and the embossed sections <b>6</b>â². As a result, adhesiveness between the top sheet <b>2</b> and the absorbent body <b>3</b> is improved, not only between the pressure bonded sections but also between the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> and the embossed sections <b>6</b>â², and fluid excreted onto the top sheet <b>2</b> more rapidly migrates into the absorbent body <b>3</b> and is absorbed. In order to obtain this effect even more notably, preferably during production of the absorbent article <b>1</b> the embossed sections <b>6</b>â² are formed first, and then the pressure bonded sections are formed. This is because such a procedure will effectively apply tension to the top sheet <b>2</b> while bonding the top sheet <b>2</b> and the absorbent body <b>3</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00336-en" num="0299">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the recesses <b>10</b> are formed to the same depth at all locations of the absorbent body <b>3</b>, but the depths may be changed for different locations of the absorbent body <b>3</b>. The same applies for the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b>. This has the advantage of improving the flexibility and fitting property of the napkin while obtaining the desired absorption capacity.</p>
      <p id="p-00337-en" num="0300">The top sheet <b>2</b> of the absorbent article <b>1</b> of the invention preferably has a plurality of projections on the skin side surface, as mentioned above. The projections may be formed as islands across the entire skin side surface of the top sheet <b>2</b>. The top sheet <b>2</b> is composed of a fiber material, such as a nonwoven fabric, the projections being filled with fibers. By forming a plurality of projections, excreted fluids more easily flow into the recesses between the projections, and the fluids are rapidly removed from the skin side surface of the top sheet <b>2</b>. Also, the top sheet <b>2</b> has high compression recoverability in the thickness direction, and exhibits a satisfactory cushion feel. Furthermore, since the contact area with skin is reduced, mustiness is prevented and the feeling of dryness is further increased. From these viewpoints, the projections preferably have heights of 0.3 to 5 mm and especially 0.5 to 3 mm. Also, when the top sheet is viewed flat, the projections 11 preferably have an area of 0.5 to 10 mm<sup>2 </sup>and especially 1 to 5 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00338-en" num="0301">On the other hand, the clothing side surface of the top sheet <b>2</b> is flatter than the skin side surface. Specifically, the clothing side surface of the top sheet <b>2</b> is essentially flat, or even if it is not flat, it is flatter than the skin side surface of the top sheet <b>2</b>. Because of this, and the fact that the surface facing the top sheet of the absorbent body <b>3</b> is flat, adhesiveness between the top sheet <b>2</b> and the absorbent body <b>3</b> is improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00339-en" num="0302">From the viewpoint of further increasing adhesiveness between the top sheet <b>2</b> and the absorbent body <b>3</b>, as mentioned above, the top sheet <b>2</b> preferably has stretchability, but it may also be one that is commonly used in the technical field, without any particular restrictions. In order to impart stretchability to the top sheet <b>2</b>, the constituent fibers used for the top sheet <b>2</b> may be, for example, elastic fibers whose material itself exhibits stretchability, or fibers exhibiting stretchability by having a specific spatial configuration, such as solid crimped fibers. Elastic fibers whose material itself exhibits stretchability include fibers obtained using a synthetic rubber, such as styrene-butadiene, butadiene, isoprene or neoprene or an elastomer material, such as natural rubber, obtained by melt spinning, or synthetic fibers composed of polyurethane or polyester, such as spandex. As fibers that exhibit stretchability by having a specific spatial configuration there are particularly preferred solid crimped fibers crimped into a spiral form. For example, there may be mentioned latent crimping fibers that exhibit spiral crimping by heat treatment. In addition, there may be mentioned sheet-like materials having a structure that allows passage of fluids, such as porous films, woven fabrics or nonwoven fabrics. The fibers composing such a woven fabric or nonwoven fabric may be natural fibers or chemical fibers, with examples of natural fibers including cellulose, such as ground pulp and cotton, and examples of chemical fibers including regenerated cellulose, such as rayon and fibril rayon, semi-synthetic cellulose, such as acetate and triacetate, thermoplastic hydrophobic chemical fibers, and hydrophilicized thermoplastic hydrophobic chemical fibers.</p>
      <p id="p-00340-en" num="0303">Examples of thermoplastic hydrophobic chemical fibers include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) monofilaments, and fibers composed of PE and PP graft polymers. Examples of nonwoven fabrics include air-through nonwoven fabrics, spunbond nonwoven fabrics, point bond nonwoven fabrics, spunlace nonwoven fabrics, needle punching nonwoven fabrics and meltblown nonwoven fabrics, as well as combinations thereof (such as SMS and the like).</p>
      <p id="p-00341-en" num="0304">The top sheet <b>2</b> preferably has a gradually densifying structure from the skin side surface of the top sheet toward the clothing side surface of the top sheet. This further increases attraction for fluids, so that fluids rapidly migrate to the absorbent body <b>3</b>. In this case, the structure may be a continuous densified structure from the skin side surface toward the clothing side surface, or it may be a stepwise-densified structure. For the same reason, the top sheet <b>2</b> preferably has gradually increasing hydrophilicity from the skin side surface toward the clothing side surface. In this case, it may be continuously increasing hydrophilicity from the skin side surface toward the clothing side surface, or it may be stepwise increasing hydrophilicity.</p>
      <p id="p-00342-en" num="0305">In order to produce a structure which gradually densifies from the skin side surface to the clothing side surface of the top sheet <b>2</b>, for example, the top sheet <b>2</b> may be formed as a multilayer structure with two or more layers, with layers of increasingly higher fiber density toward the lower layers. Similarly, in order to produce a structure with gradually increasing hydrophilicity from the skin side surface to the clothing side surface of the top sheet <b>2</b>, for example, the top sheet <b>2</b> may be formed as a multilayer structure with two or more layers, with layers of increasingly high hydrophilicity toward the lower layers. In regarding to hydrophilicity, it preferably has a property of being resistant to reduction in hydrophilicity with repeated absorption of fluids, or in other words, it has stable and durable hydrophilicity.</p>
      <p id="p-00343-en" num="0306">Specific examples for a top sheet <b>2</b> preferred for use in the absorbent article <b>1</b> of the invention include the sheets described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2002-165830, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2002-187228, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2003-126147, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2003-247155, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2003-250836 and elsewhere.</p>
      <p id="p-00344-en" num="0307">A first example of the absorbent body <b>3</b> is one having an absorbent core covered with a core wrap. Examples of components for the absorbent core include hydrophilic fibers, including cellulose, such as ground pulp or cotton, regenerated cellulose, such as rayon or fibril rayon, semi-synthetic cellulose, such as acetate or triacetate, particulate polymers, filamentous polymers, thermoplastic hydrophobic chemical fibers, and hydrophilicized thermoplastic hydrophobic chemical fibers, as well as combinations of the foregoing. The component of the absorbent core may also be a super-absorbent polymer, such as granules of a sodium acrylate copolymer or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00345-en" num="0308">The core wrap is not particularly restricted so long as it is a substance that is liquid-permeable and with a barrier property that does not allow permeation of the polymer absorbent body, and it may be a woven fabric or nonwoven fabric, for example. The woven fabric or nonwoven fabric may be made of a natural fiber, chemical fiber, tissue, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00346-en" num="0309">A second example of the absorbent body <b>3</b> is one formed from an absorbing sheet or polymer sheet, with a thickness of preferably about 0.3 to about 5.0 mm. The absorbing sheet or polymer sheet may usually be used without any particular restrictions so long as it is one that can be used in an absorbent article, such as a sanitary napkin.</p>
      <p id="p-00347-en" num="0310">As the back sheet <b>8</b> there may be mentioned films comprising PE and PP, air-permeable resin films, air-permeable resin films bonded to spunbond or spunlace nonwoven fabrics, and multilayer nonwoven fabrics, such as SMS. In consideration of flexibility of the absorbent article, a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film with a basis weight of about 15-30 g/m<sup>2</sup>, for example, is preferred.</p>
      <p id="p-00348-en" num="0311">The side sheet <b>5</b> may be any of the same examples as for the liquid-permeable top sheet. The side flaps <b>4</b> can be formed from a side sheet <b>5</b> and a liquid-impermeable back sheet <b>8</b>, and optionally it may have a reinforcing sheet, such as paper, between them.</p>
      <p id="p-00349-en" num="0312">When the liquid-permeable top sheet <b>2</b> is formed from a nonwoven fabric or woven fabric, the blood slipping agent <b>11</b> or blood slipping agent-containing composition <b>11</b> preferably does not obstruct the voids between the fibers of the nonwoven fabric or woven fabric, and for example, the blood slipping agent <b>11</b> or blood slipping agent-containing composition <b>11</b> may be attached as droplets or particulates on the surface of the nonwoven fabric or woven fabric fibers, or it may be covering the surfaces of the fibers.</p>
      <p id="p-00350-en" num="0313">On the other hand, when the liquid-permeable top sheet is formed of a porous film, the blood slipping agent <b>11</b> or blood slipping agent-containing composition <b>11</b> preferably does not occlude the pores of the porous film, and for example, the blood slipping agent <b>11</b> or the blood slipping agent-containing composition <b>11</b> may either be attached to the surface of the porous film as droplets or particulates, or it may cover the surface of the film without occluding the pores. This is because if the blood slipping agent <b>11</b> or blood slipping agent-containing composition <b>11</b> obstructs the holes in the porous film, migration of the absorbed liquid into the absorbent body may be inhibited.</p>
      <p id="p-00351-en" num="0314">Furthermore, in order for the blood slipping agent <b>11</b> or blood slipping agent-containing composition <b>11</b> to slip down together with the absorbed menstrual blood, it preferably has a large surface area, and a blood slipping agent <b>11</b> or blood slipping agent-containing composition <b>11</b> present as droplets or particulates preferably has a small droplet/particle diameter. According to still another embodiment of the absorbent article of the invention, the absorbent article has an absorbent body comprising a blood slipping agent <b>11</b> or a blood slipping agent-containing composition <b>11</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00352-en" num="0315">When the material coated with the blood slipping agent <b>11</b> or blood slipping agent-containing composition <b>11</b>, for example, a top sheet, is a nonwoven fabric or woven fabric formed from a synthetic resin, or a porous film or the like, it is preferably subjected to hydrophilicizing treatment. The hydrophilicizing treatment may involve coating the surfaces of the fibers of the nonwoven fabric or woven fabric or the surface of the porous film with a hydrophilic agent, or mixing a hydrophilic agent with the synthetic resin used as the starting material for the nonwoven fabric or woven fabric or porous film.</p>
      <p id="p-00353-en" num="0316">This is because, if the material before coating of the blood slipping agent <b>11</b> or blood slipping agent-containing composition <b>11</b> is hydrophilic, there will be lipophilic regions due to the blood slipping agent and hydrophilic regions due to the hydrophilic agent, that are sparsely dispersed on the top sheet <b>2</b>, which will allow the blood slipping agent or blood slipping agent-containing composition to exhibit slipping performance and will facilitate rapid migration of menstrual blood into the absorbent body.</p>
      <p id="p-00354-en" num="0317">The blood slipping agent <b>11</b> or blood slipping agent-containing composition <b>11</b> also has an effect as a lubricant. Thus, when the top sheet <b>2</b> is a nonwoven fabric or woven fabric, the blood slipping agent or blood slipping agent-containing composition can have reduced friction between the fibers and improved flexibility. When the top sheet is a resin film, the blood slipping agent or blood slipping agent-containing composition can have reduced friction between the top sheet and the skin.</p>
      <heading id="h-00019-en" level="2">&lt;Method for Producing Absorbent Article&gt;</heading>
      <p id="p-00355-en" num="0318">An embodiment of a method for producing an absorbent article <b>1</b> of the invention will now be described, using a method for producing a sanitary napkin as an example. The production apparatus <b>100</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> was used.</p>
      <p id="p-00356-en" num="0319">Recesses <b>124</b> are formed at a prescribed pitch in the circumferential direction on the peripheral surface of a suction drum <b>120</b> rotating in the machine direction MD, as a molding form in which the absorbent body material <b>122</b> is to be packed. When the suction drum <b>120</b> is rotated and the recesses <b>124</b> approach the material feeder <b>121</b>, the suction section <b>126</b> acts on the recesses <b>124</b> and the absorbent body material <b>122</b> supplied from the material feeder <b>121</b> is vacuum suctioned into the recesses <b>124</b>. The material feeder <b>121</b> is formed to cover the suction drum <b>120</b>, and the material feeder <b>121</b> supplies the absorbent body material <b>122</b> into the recesses <b>124</b> by air transport, forming an absorbent body <b>3</b> in the recesses <b>124</b>. The absorbent body <b>3</b> formed in the recesses <b>124</b> is transferred onto a carrier sheet <b>110</b> advancing in the machine direction MD.</p>
      <p id="p-00357-en" num="0320">Embossing is carried out from one surface of the absorbent body <b>3</b> (the surface facing the back sheet). Recesses <b>10</b> are formed in the layered body <b>262</b> by passing between a lower roll <b>132</b>-<b>1</b> having a plurality of protruding pins planted around the peripheral surface in a regular manner (not shown), and an upper roll <b>131</b>-<b>1</b> as a smooth roll, as the embossing apparatus <b>130</b>. During embossing, the roll may be heated to a prescribed temperature so that the recesses <b>10</b> are formed in an effective manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00358-en" num="0321">While not shown in the drawing, the carrier sheet <b>110</b> supports the layered body <b>262</b> by two belts extending on both sides toward the machine direction (MD direction). That is, both edge sections (both end sections) extending on both sides in the machine direction (MD direction), of the surface on the carrier sheet <b>110</b> side of the layered body <b>262</b> the bottom side in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>), are supported by the carrier sheet <b>110</b>, but the center section extending toward the machine direction (MD direction) is not supported on the carrier sheet <b>110</b> but is exposed between the two belts of the carrier sheet <b>110</b>. The exposed sections are embossed. Thus, the layered body <b>262</b> is embossed by the embossing apparatus <b>130</b> (upper roll <b>131</b>-<b>1</b> and lower roll <b>132</b>-<b>1</b>) while mounted on the carrier sheet <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00359-en" num="0322">The top sheet <b>2</b> supplied from the roll <b>210</b> is layered on the absorbent body <b>3</b>, forming a layered body <b>262</b>. The layered body <b>262</b> is subjected to embossing, forming embossed sections <b>6</b>â² by hot pressing on the top sheet <b>2</b> and the absorbent body <b>3</b>. The embossing is accomplished, for example, by inserting the layered body <b>262</b> between a roll with irregularities (not shown) having annular protrusions corresponding to the embossed sections <b>6</b>â² formed on the peripheral surface, and a receiving roll having a peripheral surface made of a surface-smooth elastic solid. Specifically, the embossed sections <b>6</b>â² are formed on the layered body <b>262</b> by passing between the upper roll <b>131</b>-<b>2</b> and lower roll <b>132</b>-<b>2</b> of the embossing apparatus <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00360-en" num="0323">Next, the interior area of the embossed sections <b>6</b>â² of the layered body <b>262</b> on which the embossed sections <b>6</b>â² have been formed is subjected to embossing to form pressure bonded sections <b>9</b>. The embossing is accomplished by inserting the layered body <b>262</b> between a roll with a plurality of protruding pins planted in a regular manner on the peripheral surface (not shown), and a smooth roll. Specifically, pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> are formed on the layered body <b>262</b> by passing between the upper roll <b>131</b>-<b>3</b> and lower roll <b>132</b>-<b>3</b> of the embossing apparatus <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00361-en" num="0324">Next, the back sheet <b>8</b> that has been reeled out from a back sheet roll <b>140</b> is coated with an adhesive from an adhesive coater, and the back sheet <b>8</b> and layered body <b>262</b> are layered to form a layered body <b>263</b>. Next, the layered body <b>263</b> is formed into the shape of an absorbent article by round embossing with an embossing roll <b>261</b> (not shown), and a cutter <b>150</b> is used to cut it into the shape of the absorbent article <b>1</b> (sanitary napkin).</p>
      <p id="p-00362-en" num="0325">A coating spray <b>160</b> of the blood slipping agent <b>11</b> or blood slipping agent-containing composition <b>11</b> is used to coat the blood slipping agent <b>161</b> onto the center region of the absorbent article <b>1</b> (sanitary napkin), to form a blood slipping agent layer on the skin side surface of the top sheet <b>2</b>. In this manner it is possible to produce an absorbent article <b>1</b> (sanitary napkin).</p>
      <p id="p-00363-en" num="0326">The blood slipping agent layer is preferably formed in at least the excretory opening contact region in the excreta-supply region of the top sheet <b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00364-en" num="0327">In the method for producing an absorbent article according to the invention, the blood slipping agent was coated after cutting out the absorbent article <b>1</b> (sanitary napkin), but it may instead be coated at any stage before cutting, or it may be coated during the production steps for the top sheet <b>2</b>. In order to prevent dripping down of the blood slipping agent that has been coated during production, the blood slipping agent is preferably coated at a downstream stage of the production process, such as immediately before packaging of the absorbent article <b>1</b> (sanitary napkin).</p>
      <p id="p-00365-en" num="0328">There are no particular restrictions on the method of applying the blood slipping agent or blood slipping agent-containing composition, or the coating solution containing it, and if necessary the blood slipping agent or blood slipping agent-containing composition or the coating solution containing it may be heated, and a coating applicator, for example a non-contact coater, such as a spiral coater, curtain coater, spray coater or dip coater, or a contact coater, may be used for application of the blood slipping agent or blood slipping agent-containing composition or the coating solution containing it. The coating applicator is preferably a non-contact coater, from the viewpoint of uniformly dispersing the droplet or particulate modifying agent throughout, and from the viewpoint of not causing damage in the material.</p>
      <p id="p-00366-en" num="0329">The blood slipping agent or blood slipping agent-containing composition, or the coating solution containing it, may be coated directly, if it is a liquid at room temperature, or it may be heated to lower the viscosity, and when it is a solid at room temperature, it may be heated to liquefaction and coated from a control seam HMA (Hot Melt Adhesive) gun. By increasing the air pressure of the control seam HMA gun, it is possible to apply the blood slipping agent or blood slipping agent-containing composition as fine particulates. The coating amount of the blood modifying agent or blood slipping agent-containing composition can be adjusted, for example, by adjusting the discharged amount from a control seam HMA gun.</p>
      <p id="p-00367-en" num="0330">The blood slipping agent or blood slipping agent-containing composition may, if desired, be applied as a coating solution containing a volatile solvent, such as an alcohol-based solvent, ester-based solvent or aromatic solvent. If the coating solution includes a volatile solvent, the viscosity of the coating solution containing the blood slipping agent or blood slipping agent-containing composition will be lowered, thereby allowing the application steps to be simplified, facilitating application and making heating during application unnecessary.</p>
      <p id="p-00368-en" num="0331">According to the method for producing an absorbent article <b>1</b> of the invention, pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> are formed in the interior area of both embossed sections <b>6</b>â² after forming the embossed sections <b>6</b>â², such that strong tension is naturally applied to the top sheet <b>2</b> and the top sheet <b>2</b> is anchored to the absorbent body <b>3</b> in that state. Furthermore, since the top sheet is bonded to the absorbent body while being highly stretched at the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b>, powerful bonding strength is obtained and adhesiveness between the top sheet <b>2</b> and the absorbent body <b>3</b> is further improved at the sections other than the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00369-en" num="0332">The above explanation concerned one embodiment of the method for producing an absorbent article according to the invention, but the invention is not restricted to that embodiment. For example, the top sheet <b>2</b> of the embodiment was a flat sheet on both the skin side surface and the clothing side surface, but it may instead have a plurality of projections on the skin side surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00370-en" num="0333">Also, in this embodiment of the method for producing an absorbent article according to the invention, the pressure bonded sections <b>9</b> may be formed before forming the embossed sections <b>6</b>â², so that the embossed sections <b>6</b>â² are formed afterwards.</p>

Each blood slipping agent was used directly, when the blood slipping agent was liquid at room temperature, or when the blood slipping agent was solid at room temperature it was heated to a temperature of its melting point 20Â° C., and then a control seam HMA gun was used for atomization of each blood slipping agent and coating onto the skin contact surface of the top sheet to a basis weight of about 5 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>

      <p id="p-00485-en" num="0440">An acrylic board with an opened hole (200 mmÃ100 mm, 125 g, with a 40 mmÃ10 mm hole opened at the center) was placed on a top sheet comprising each blood slipping agent, and 3 g of horse EDTA blood at 37Â±1Â° C. (obtained by adding ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (hereunder, âEDTAâ) to horse blood to prevent coagulation) was dropped through the hole using a pipette (once), and after 1 minute, 3 g of horse EDTA blood at 37Â±1Â° C. was again added dropwise through the acrylic board hole with a pipette (twice).</p>
      <p id="p-00486-en" num="0441">After the second dropping of blood, the acrylic board was immediately removed and 10 sheets of filter paper (Qualitative filter paper No. 2, product of Advantech Toyo, Inc., 50 mmÃ35 mm) were placed on the location where the blood had been dropped, and then a weight was placed thereover to a pressure of 30 g/cm<sup>2</sup>. After 1 minute, the filter paper was removed and the ârewetting rateâ was calculated by the following formula.</p>
      <p id="p-00487-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]Rewetting rate(%)=100Ã(filter paper mass after testâinitial filter paper mass)/6[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00488-en" num="0442">In addition to the rewetting rate evaluation, the âabsorbent body migration rateâ was also measured as the time until migration of blood from the top sheet to the absorbent body after the second dropping of blood. The absorbent body migration rate is the time from introducing the blood onto the top sheet, until the redness of the blood could be seen on the surface and in the interior of the top sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00489-en" num="0443">The results for the rewetting rate and absorbent body migration rate are shown below in Table 2.</p>
      <p id="p-00490-en" num="0444">The whiteness of the skin contact surface of the top sheet (TS) after the absorbent body migration rate test was visually evaluated on the following scale.</p>
      <p id="p-00491-en" num="0445">VG (Very Good): Virtually no redness of blood remaining, and no clear delineation between areas with and without blood.</p>
      <p id="p-00492-en" num="0446">G (Good): Slight redness of blood remaining, but difficult to discriminate between areas with and without blood.</p>
      <p id="p-00493-en" num="0447">F (Fair): Slight redness of blood remaining, areas with blood discernible.</p>
      <p id="p-00494-en" num="0448">P (Poor): Redness of blood completely remaining.</p>
      <p id="p-00495-en" num="0449">The tack on the skin contact surface of the top sheet was also measured at 35Â° C., and evaluated on the following scale.</p>
      <p id="p-00496-en" num="0450">G: No tack</p>

      <p id="p-00501-en" num="0454">In the absence of a blood slipping agent, the rewetting rate was 22.7% and the absorbent body migration rate was greater than 60 seconds, but the glycerin and fatty acid triesters all produced rewetting rates of no greater than 7.0% and absorbent body migration rates of no longer than 8 seconds, and therefore significantly improved the absorption performance.</p>
      <p id="p-00502-en" num="0455">Similarly, it was found that the absorption performance is greatly improved with a blood slipping agent having a kinematic viscosity of about 0.01 to 80 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at 40Â° C., a water holding percentage of about 0.01 to about 4.0 mass %, and a weight-average molecular weight of less than about 1,000.</p>
      <p id="p-00503-en" num="0456">Next, several volunteer subjects were asked to wear sanitary napkin Nos. 1-1 to 1-51, and the obtained responses indicated that with the sanitary napkins comprising blood slipping agent Nos. 1-1 to 1-23, the top sheets had no sticky feel and the top sheets were smooth, even after absorption of menstrual blood.</p>
      <p id="p-00504-en" num="0457">Also, with sanitary napkins that comprised blood slipping agent Nos. 1-11, 13, 16, 18-20 and 23, the skin contact surfaces of the top sheets after absorption of menstrual blood had not been reddened by the blood and the unpleasantness was minimal.</p>
      <p id="p-00505-en" num="0458">Also, the top sheet was removed from a commercially available sanitary napkin having the shape shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> (not coated with a blood slipping agent), and the clothing side surface thereof was coated with the aforementioned blood slipping agent in the region indicated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The blood slipping agent was coated so that the blood slipping agent-containing region contained the blood slipping agent at a basis weight of about 5 g/m<sup>2</sup>, using a control seam HMA gun, with heating to a temperature of the melting point +20Â° C. as necessary. Upon visually confirming the top sheet coated with the blood slipping agent, the basis weight of the blood slipping agent on the clothing side surface (coated surface) was found to be greater than the basis weight of the blood slipping agent on the skin side surface (non-coated surface).</p>
      <p id="p-00506-en" num="0459">Next, the top sheet was rebonded to the absorbent body to prepare sanitary napkins No. 1â²-1 (H-408BRS) to No. 1â²-23 (PARLEAM 6).</p>
      <p id="p-00507-en" num="0460">Sanitary napkins No. 1â²-1 (H-408BRS) to No. 1â²-23 (PARLEAM 6) were thus prepared. The sanitary napkins No. 1â²-1 and No. 1-1 were identical in that the blood slipping agent was H-408BRS, but the distribution of the blood slipping agent in the thickness direction of the absorbent article was different. This also applies to the other sanitary napkins.</p>
      <p id="p-00508-en" num="0461">When the sanitary napkins produced for Nos. 1â²-1 to 1â²-23 were worn by multiple volunteer participants, the sanitary napkins of Nos. 1â²-1 to 1â²-23 generally had the same performance as Nos. 1-1 to 1-23, and the responses received indicated that after menstrual blood had been absorbed, the menstrual blood was rapidly absorbed into the absorbent body within the excretory opening contact region.</p>
      <p id="p-00509-en" num="0462">This equivalent performance is partially attributed to the blood slipping agent on the clothing side surface of the top sheet having migrated onto the skin side surface by pressure applied onto the sanitary napkin by daily activities of the wearer.</p>

      <p id="p-00510-en" num="0463">The surface residue rate of menstrual blood on a top sheet with a ridge-furrow structure was evaluated.</p>
      <p id="p-00511-en" num="0464">There were prepared a top sheet, formed of a hydrophilic agent-treated air-through nonwoven fabric (composite fiber composed of polyester and polyethylene terephthalate, basis weight: 35 g/m<sup>2</sup>), a second sheet, formed of an air-through nonwoven fabric (composite fiber composed of polyester and polyethylene terephthalate, basis weight: 30 g/m<sup>2</sup>), an absorbent body comprising pulp (basis weight: 150 to 450 g/m<sup>2</sup>, increased at the center section), an acrylic super-absorbent polymer (basis weight: 15 g/m<sup>2</sup>) and tissue as a core wrap, a water-repellent agent-treated side sheet, and a back sheet composed of a polyethylene film.</p>
      <p id="p-00512-en" num="0465">The top sheet was a top sheet produced by the method described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2008-2034, having a ridge-furrow structure, with a ridge thickness of approximately 1.5 mm and a furrow thickness of approximately 0.4 mm, and the pitch of the ridge-furrow structure (ridge width+furrow width) was approximately 4 mm and open holes were formed in the furrows at an open area of approximately 15%.</p>
      <p id="p-00513-en" num="0466">UNISTAR H-408BRS (product of NOF Corp., tetraester of pentaerythritol and fatty acid) was selected as the blood slipping agent, and it was coated onto the skin contact surface (a surface having ridge-furrow structure) of the top sheet from a control seam HMA gun at room temperature, to a basis weight of 5.0 g/m<sup>2</sup>. With an electron microscope it was confirmed that the H-408BRS was adhering onto the fiber surfaces as fine particulates.</p>
      <p id="p-00514-en" num="0467">A back sheet, an absorbent body, a second sheet, and a top sheet with the ridge-furrow surface facing upward, were stacked in that order to form sanitary napkin No. 2-1.</p>
      <p id="p-00515-en" num="0468">Sanitary napkins No. 2-2 to No. 2-40 were produced, changing the blood slipping agent from UNISTAR H-408BRS to the ones listed in Table 3 below. Each blood slipping agent was used directly, when it was liquid at room temperature, or when the blood slipping agent was solid at room temperature it was heated to a temperature of its melting point+20Â° C., and then a control seam HMA gun was used for atomization of the blood slipping agent and coating onto the skin contact surface of the top sheet to a basis weight of about 5 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00516-en" num="0469">The blood slipping agent was coated onto essentially the entire skin contact surface of the top sheet, and on both the ridges and furrows.</p>

      <p id="p-00517-en" num="0470">After measuring the mass W<sub>2 </sub>(g) of the top sheet (the mass of the top sheet before the test), an acrylic board with an opened hole (200 mmÃ100 mm, 125 g, with a 40 mmÃ10 mm hole opened at the center) was placed on the top sheet, at the center section in the lengthwise direction and widthwise direction of the absorbent article, and 4.0 g of horse EDTA blood at 37Â±1Â° C. (obtained by adding ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (hereunder, âEDTAâ) to horse blood to prevent coagulation) was dropped through the hole using a pipette.</p>
      <p id="p-00518-en" num="0471">After dropping the horse EDTA blood, the acrylic board was immediately removed, the top sheet was taken off, the mass W<sub>3 </sub>(g) (mass of the top sheet after the test) was measured and the âsurface residue rate A (mass %)â was calculated by the following formula.</p>

      <p id="p-00522-en" num="0473">With sanitary napkin No. 2-40, which had no blood slipping agent, the surface residue rate was 7.5 mass %, but with sanitary napkins No. 2-1 to No. 2-16 wherein the kinematic viscosity and water holding percentage were within the prescribed ranges, the surface residue rate was 2.5 mass % or lower.</p>
      <p id="p-00523-en" num="0474">With sanitary napkins No. 2-1 to No. 2-16, it was observed that the horse EDTA blood that was dropped onto the ridges of the top sheet slid down from the ridges into the furrows, and was rapidly absorbed from the furrows into the absorbent body. However, with sanitary napkin No. 2-40 which had no blood slipping agent, the dropped horse EDTA blood did not slip down into the furrows but slowly dripped down into the furrows, most of it remaining on the ridges of the top sheet. Also, with the absorbent articles with high a water holding percentage, as with No. 2-25, for example, the horse EDTA blood that was dropped onto the ridges of the top sheet did not slip down into the furrows but slowly dripped while partially remaining on the top sheet, and a portion thereof remained on the ridges.</p>

      <heading id="h-00029-en" level="1">Viscosity of Blood Containing Blood Slipping Agent</heading>
      <p id="p-00525-en" num="0476">The viscosity of the blood slipping agent-containing blood was measured using a Rheometric Expansion System ARES (Rheometric Scientific, Inc.). After adding 2 mass % of PANACET 810s to horse defibrinated blood, the mixture was gently agitated to form a sample, the sample was placed on a 50 mm-diameter parallel plate, with a gap of 100 Î¼m, and the viscosity was measured at 37Â±0.5Â° C. The sample was not subjected to a uniform shear rate, due to the parallel plate, but the average shear rate indicated by the device was 10 s<sup>â1</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00526-en" num="0477">The viscosity of the horse defibrinated blood containing 2 mass % PANACET 810s was 5.9 mPaÂ·s, while the viscosity of the horse defibrinated blood containing no blood slipping agent was 50.4 mPaÂ·s. Thus, the horse defibrinated blood containing 2 mass % PANACET 810s clearly had an approximately 90% lower viscosity than the blood containing no blood slipping agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00527-en" num="0478">It is known that blood contains components, such as blood cells and has a thixotropic nature, and it is believed that the blood slipping agent of the invention has an effect of lowering the viscosity of blood, such as menstrual blood in the low viscosity range. Lowering the blood viscosity presumably allows absorbed menstrual blood to more easily migrate rapidly from the top sheet to the absorbent body.</p>

      <p id="p-00528-en" num="0479">Menstrual blood was sampled from healthy volunteers onto food storage wrap film, and PANACET 810s dispersed in a 10-fold mass of phosphate-buffered saline was added to a portion thereof to a PANACET 810s concentration of 1 mass %. The menstrual blood was dropped onto a slide glass, a cover glass was placed thereover, and the state of the erythrocytes was observed with an optical microscope. A photomicrograph of menstrual blood containing no blood slipping agent is shown in <figref>FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>), and a photomicrograph of menstrual blood containing PANACET 810s is shown in <figref>FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
      <p id="p-00529-en" num="0480">As shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the erythrocytes formed aggregates, including a rouleaux structure, in the menstrual blood containing no blood slipping agent, while the erythrocytes were stably dispersed in the menstrual blood containing PANACET 810s. This suggests that the blood slipping agent has the function of stabilizing erythrocytes in blood.</p>
