      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a two-part curable liquid silicone rubber composition composed of a first composition and a second composition, which are stored separately and yield upon mixing a silicone rubber forming composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-168106, filed on Jul. 30, 2012, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In silicone rubber compositions which contain a calcium carbonate powder and which are cured by a hydrosilylation reaction, the calcium carbonate powder contains alkaline components as impurities, and therefore involve problems such as hydrogen gas being generated during storage due to reactions with organopolysiloxanes having silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms, which are contained as curing agents in the composition. As a result, for example, silicone rubber compositions comprising a diorganopolysiloxane having at least 2 alkenyl groups in a molecule, a calcium carbonate powder substantially surface treated with a diorganopolysiloxane, an organopolysiloxane having at least 2 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in a molecule and a platinum group metal-type catalyst have been proposed (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-38016).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In such cases, storing an addition reaction curable silicone rubber composition as two components is a commonly used means, and storing a calcium carbonate-containing addition reaction curable silicone rubber composition as two components has also been proposed. In addition, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-38016 proposes a two-part composition composed of a first liquid, which contains an alkenyl groups-containing diorganopolysiloxane and calcium carbonate surface treated with a diorganopolysiloxane, and a second liquid, which contains an organohydrogenpolysiloxane, a platinum group metal-type catalyst and an adhesion-imparting agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication Nos. 2006-117823, 2006-335872 and 2010-163478 indicate that by not blending calcium carbonate in a liquid that contains an organohydrogenpolysiloxane having an average of 2 or more silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in a molecule, a composition that contains a curing agent undergoes little change in viscosity even when two liquids are stored for long periods, these liquids can be uniformly mixed at a volume ratio of 1:1 by means of a motionless mixer such as a static mixer, and it is possible to provide a two-liquid silicone rubber composition able to achieve the initially designed physical properties of a silicone rubber and adhesive properties to a silicone rubber.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">However, there is no recitation in any of these Patent Documents regarding changes in physical properties and/or adhesion in cases where the volume ratio, upon mixing, when forming a silicone rubber forming composition by mixing the separately stored first composition and second composition, varies.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide a two-part curable liquid silicone rubber composition composed of a first composition and a second composition that are stored separately, in which the physical properties and the adhesion to silicone rubber of a cured product thereof do not decline when mixed even in cases where a mixture ratio of the first composition to the second composition varies.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0019">The two-part curable liquid silicone rubber composition of the present invention is described in detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0020">Component (A) is a main component of the two-part curable liquid silicone rubber composition of the present invention, and is a diorganopolysiloxane having an average of at least 2 alkenyl groups in a molecule. Examples of the alkenyl groups in component (A) include vinyl groups, allyl groups, butenyl groups, pentenyl groups, hexenyl groups, and heptenyl groups. Of these, vinyl groups are preferable. Moreover, examples of silicon-bonded organic groups in component (A) other than alkenyl groups include methyl groups, ethyl groups, propyl groups, butyl groups, pentyl groups, hexyl groups, and similar alkyl groups; phenyl groups, tolyl groups, xylyl groups, and similar aryl groups; and 3-chloropropyl groups, 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl groups, and similar halogenated alkyl groups. Of these, methyl groups and phenyl groups are preferable. A molecular structure of component (A) is substantially straight, but a portion of the molecular chain may be partially branched provided that the object of the present invention is not inhibited. A viscosity at 25Â° C. of component (A) is not limited, but is preferably in a range from 100 to 1,000,000 mPaÂ·s, and more preferably in a range from 100 to 500,000 mPaÂ·s.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0021">Examples of the diorganopolysiloxane for component (A) described above include dimethylpolysiloxanes capped at both molecular terminals with dimethylvinylsiloxy groups, copolymers of dimethylsiloxane and methylvinylsiloxane capped at both molecular terminals with dimethylvinylsiloxy groups; copolymers of dimethylsiloxane and methylvinylsiloxane capped at both molecular terminals with trimethylsiloxy groups; diorganopolysiloxanes in which a part or all of the methyl groups thereof are substituted by ethyl groups, propyl groups, or similar alkyl groups, phenyl groups, tolyl groups, or similar aryl groups, 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl groups, or similar halogenated alkyl groups; diorganopolysiloxanes in which a part or all of the vinyl groups thereof are substituted by allyl groups, propenyl groups, or similar alkenyl groups; and mixtures of two or more of the diorganopolysiloxanes described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0022">Component (B) is a curing agent which undergoes a crosslinking reaction with component (A) in the presence of component (E), which is described later, so as to crosslink the silicone rubber forming composition of the present invention, and is composed of (B-1) an organopolysiloxane having an average of not more than 2 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in a molecule only in side molecular chains, or component (B-1) and (B-2) an organopolysiloxane having 2 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms only at both molecular terminals. By using such component (B), it is possible to impart the two-part curable liquid silicone rubber composition of the present invention with characteristics such as an obtained cured product undergoing little change in physical properties or adhesive properties to a silicone rubber even if the mixing ratio varies when the separately stored first and second compositions are mixed.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0023">A content of component (B) is an amount such that a molar ratio of silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in component (B) to alkenyl groups in component (A) is from 0.01 to 20, preferably from 0.1 to 5, and more preferably from 0.5 to 3.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0024">Component (B-1) is an organopolysiloxane having an average of not more than 2 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in a molecule only in side molecular chains, preferably has an average of less than 2 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in a molecule only in side molecular chains, and more preferably has an average of not less than 1 and less than 2 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in a molecule only in side molecular chains. If the average number of silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in the side molecular chains in component (B-1) exceeds 2, there are concerns that fluctuations will occur in the physical properties and adhesive properties to a silicone rubber of a cured product when fluctuations in the mixing ratio occur when the first composition and the second composition, which are stored separately, are mixed, as described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0025">A molecular structure of component (B-1) is not particularly limited, but can be, for example, a resin product having a straight chain, branched chain, cyclic or three dimensional mesh-like structure. Examples of silicon-bonded organic groups in component (B-1) include methyl groups, ethyl groups, propyl groups, butyl groups, pentyl groups, hexyl groups, and similar alkyl groups; phenyl groups, tolyl groups, xylyl groups, and similar aryl groups; benzyl groups, phenethyl groups, and similar aralkyl groups; and 3-chloropropyl groups, 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl groups, and similar halogenated alkyl groups.
