    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The vital role leadership plays in today's complex society cannot be underemphasized. Tomorrow's leaders need to learn and retain the knowledge and skills required of a leader in an efficient and effective manner so that they are able to step into and assume leadership positions in all phases of society.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Current systems and methods for effectively teaching leadership skills are typically limited to listening to lectures, reading case studies about the exploits of well-known leaders, and perhaps participating in an exercise designed to allow the leadership student to apply his or her knowledge and/or conceptions of leadership skills in a controlled environment. While these methods may have some merit, they also have a number of shortcomings including keeping the attention of the leadership students, not allowing for a fun and engaging experience to bolster interest in the subject matter being taught, and lacking the capacity for reinforcing the lessons presented by the learning material with quick and direct feedback to choices made by a leadership student.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Accordingly, there is a need for a novel system and method to facilitate the learning of leadership skills for those who will become tomorrow's leaders in society, business, and other endeavors. In an embodiment, a computer-implemented method for a narrative-driven role playing game is described, the method including providing, by a game engine, a plurality of zones wherein a first one of the plural zones includes a first non-player character (“NPC”) for interacting with a player character (“Character”) controlled by a player, and wherein the first zone includes one or more first quests at least one of which is locked and not initially selectable by the player, and wherein the completion of a predetermined one or ones of the one or more first quests allows for the Character to proceed to a second one of the plurality of zones; providing, via the game engine, an entry of the Character into the first zone; selecting, by the player via the game engine, a first one of the one or more non-locked first quests; and placing the Character, via the game engine, in the selected first quest.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The embodiment further provides for interacting, by the player via the game engine, in the selected first quest with the first NPC in a first set of narrative-driven dialogs each having a branching dialog tree, wherein a first dialog of the first set of dialogs includes a predetermined initial input by the first NPC and a first plurality of predetermined response options presented to the player, wherein the player selects one of the first predetermined response options, and wherein a second dialog of the first set of dialogs includes a second input by the first NPC based on the first predetermined response option selected by the player in the first dialog of the first set of dialogs; attaining one of a predetermined number of first outcomes based on one or more responses selected by the player in the first set of narrative-driven dialogs; determining, via the game engine, a first quest score for the selected first quest wherein the first quest score is based on the first outcome attained; placing the Character, via the game engine, into the first zone; displaying to the player, via the game engine, an effect to the first zone based on the attained first outcome wherein the effect includes unlocking a locked first quest; selecting, by the player via the game engine, a second one of the one or more non-locked first quests; placing the Character, via the game engine, into a second one of the plural zones upon the player's completion of the predetermined one or ones of the one or more first quests; determining, via the game engine, an aggregate score for the player based on completed selected first quests; and displaying, to the player, an indication of the aggregate score.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In another embodiment, the computer-implemented method for a narrative-driven role playing game may be stored on a non-transitory machine-readable medium in the form of a plurality of executable instructions.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">According to yet another embodiment, a computer-implemented method for a narrative-driven role playing game is provided to teach and/or reinforce leadership training, aspects, and strategies to a player, the method including providing, by a game engine, a plurality of zones wherein a first one of the plural zones includes a first non-player character (“NPC”) for interacting with a player character (“Character”) controlled by a player, and wherein the first zone includes one or more first quests at least one of which is locked and not initially selectable by the player, and wherein the completion of a predetermined one or ones of the one or more first quests allows for the Character to proceed to a second one of the plurality of zones, and wherein the second one of the plural zones includes a second NPC for interacting with the Character controlled by the player, and wherein the second zone includes one or more second quests at least one of which is locked and not initially selectable by the player, and wherein the completion of a predetermined one or ones of the one or more second quests allows for the Character to proceed to a third one of the plurality of zones; providing, via the game engine, an entry of the Character into the first zone; selecting, by the player via the game engine, a first one of the one or more non-locked first quests; and placing the Character via the game engine, in the selected first quest.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The embodiment further provides for interacting, by the player via the game engine, in the selected first quest with the first NPC in a first set of narrative-driven dialogs each having a branching dialog tree, wherein a first dialog of the first set of dialogs includes a predetermined initial input by the first NPC and a first plurality of predetermined response options presented to the player wherein the first plurality of predetermined response options include a praise response, a coach response, and a scold response, wherein the player selects one of the first predetermined response options, and wherein a second dialog of the first set of dialogs includes a second input by the first NPC based on the first predetermined response option selected by the player in the first dialog of the first set of dialogs; attaining one of a predetermined number of first outcomes based on one or more responses selected by the player in the first set of narrative-driven dialogs, wherein one of the branching dialog trees in the first set of narrative-driven dialogs includes a first path having a first number of NPC interactions for attaining a first of the predetermined number of outcomes and a second path having a second number of NPC interactions for attaining the first of the predetermined number of outcomes; and determining, via the game engine, a first quest score for the selected first quest wherein the first quest score is based on the first outcome attained.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The embodiment further provides for placing the Character, via the game engine, into the first zone; displaying to the player, via the game engine, an effect to the first zone based on the attained first outcome wherein the effect includes unlocking a locked first quest; selecting, by the player via the game engine, a second one of the one or more non-locked first quests; placing the Character, via the game engine, into a second one of the plural zones upon the player's completion of the predetermined one or ones of the one or more first quests; determining, via the game engine, an aggregate score for the player based on completed selected first quests; displaying, to the player, an indication of the aggregate score; unlocking, via the game engine, a game feature if the aggregate score is greater than a predetermined threshold; selecting, by the player via the game engine, a first one of the one or more non-locked second quests; and placing the Character, via the game engine, in the selected second quest.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The embodiment further provides for interacting, by the player via the game engine, in the selected second quest with the second NPC in a second set of narrative-driven dialogs each having a branching dialog tree, wherein a first dialog of the second set of dialogs includes a predetermined initial input by the second NPC and a second plurality of predetermined response options presented to the player wherein the second plurality of predetermined response options include a praise response, a coach response, and a scold response, wherein the player selects one of the second predetermined response options, and wherein a second dialog of the second set of dialogs includes a second input by the second NPC based on the second predetermined response option selected by the player in the first dialog of the second set of dialogs; attaining one of a predetermined number of second outcomes based on one or more responses selected by the player in the second set of narrative-driven dialogs; and determining, via the game engine, a score for the selected second quest wherein the score is based on the second outcome attained.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The embodiment further provides for placing the Character, via the game engine, into the second zone; displaying to the player, via the game engine, an effect to the second zone based on the attained second outcome wherein the effect includes unlocking a locked second quest; selecting, by the player via the game engine, a second one of the one or more non-locked second quests; placing the Character, via the game engine, into a third one of the plural zones upon the player's completion of the predetermined one or ones of the one or more second quests; determining, via the game engine, an updated aggregate score for the player based on completed selected first and second quests; and displaying, to the player, an indication of the updated aggregate score.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In still another embodiment, the computer-implemented method for a narrative-driven role playing game which is provided to teach and/or reinforce leadership training, aspects, and strategies to a player may be stored on a non-transitory machine-readable medium in the form of a plurality of executable instructions.</p>

      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The following description of the present subject matter is provided as an enabling teaching of the present subject matter and its best, currently-known embodiment. Those skilled in the art will recognize that many changes can be made to the embodiments described herein while still obtaining the beneficial results of the present subject matter. It will also be apparent that for some embodiments, some of the desired benefits of the present subject matter can be obtained by selecting some of the features of the present subject matter without utilizing other features. Accordingly, those skilled in the art will recognize that many modifications and adaptations of the present subject matter are possible and may even be desirable in certain circumstances and are part of the present subject matter. Thus, the following description is provided as illustrative of the principles of the present subject matter and not in limitation thereof and may include modification thereto and permutations thereof. While the following exemplary discussion of the present subject matter may be directed towards or reference specific embodiments, it is to be understood that the discussion is not intended to limit the scope of those embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Those skilled in the art will further appreciate that many modifications to the exemplary embodiments described herein are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the present subject matter. Thus, the description is not intended and should not be construed to be limited to the examples given but should be granted the full breadth of protection afforded by the appended claims and equivalents thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">With reference to the figures where like elements have been given like numerical designations to facilitate an understanding of the present subject matter, various embodiments of a system and method for a role-playing game to teach and reinforce lessons and aspects of leadership are described.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The present disclosure describes novel systems and methods for teaching and exercising leadership skills and strategies. The quality of leadership has a major impact on the success of any endeavor and any organization. The best leaders are able to create a common sense of purpose in their team. They develop strategies for the implementation of the purpose. The leader then teaches and/or coaches their teammates on how to execute the developed strategies. Additionally, the leader creates the optimal context, the value system, in which the team members can achieve the mutually agreed upon objectives and be personally fulfilled in the process.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">While some people view leadership as a mystical ability bestowed upon a chosen few, the reality is that there is both an artistic aspect and a scientific aspect to leadership. The artistic aspect requires a high level of subconscious integrations by the leader based on, for example, their life experiences. Some individuals have a natural ability to conceptualize these experiences into a very useful set of “intuitive” responses to become a successful leader. However, the scientific aspect of leadership is more important and, significantly, is learnable. The fundamental concept underlying the leadership process is that beliefs produce behaviors which produce results. Therefore, leaders must instill the correct set of beliefs and insure that those beliefs are reinforced with the correct behaviors thereby creating superior results. Thus, leadership skills and strategies can be trained and developed through teaching, coaching, positive reinforcement, and repetition.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The principles of successful leadership are generally straightforward although the execution of leadership skills and strategies can be difficult. According to one leadership model, people behave on a long-term basis in a manner that is consistent with their personality, the primary components of which are beliefs, emotions, and behaviors. Beliefs influence emotions which influence behaviors and the right behaviors create the best results for the leader, the follower, and the team as a unit. Those behaviors, in turn, influence one's beliefs. Therefore, positive reinforcement of any and/or all of these aspects will result in the betterment of one's leadership skills and ability.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In an embodiment, leadership skills and strategy are taught and reinforced by use of a narrative-driven role playing game where the leadership student/game player is taught leadership skills through meaningful interactions with non-player characters. The player will journey through a realm having various NPC story zones some or all of which will have multiple branching dialog sequences. Depending on how well the player performs in the NPC interactions, the game world will grow thereby opening up new quest opportunities for the player and gaining favor with the overall ruler of the realm.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In a particular embodiment, the game will take the player on a journey beginning as a fledgling settler to the ruler of a great city. The player will begin in a small, leaderless, village and through NPC interactions the player will rise to a position of leadership and influence based on the choices made by the player during the NPC interactions. The NPC interactions are designed to teach leadership skills and will present the player with various scenarios during which the player can choose one of several responses in a dialog with the NPC in that scenario. In a further embodiment, the responses to choose from may be characterized as a praise response, a coach response, and a scold response (“PCS”). The NPC will react depending on the particular response chosen. Leadership points may be awarded to the player depending on the chosen responses. In an embodiment, the points awarded may change from dialog to dialog such that always choosing, for example, a praise response may not maximize the number of leadership points awarded. A Leadership Indicator may be displayed so that the player can view his or her progress and/or points awarded.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Additionally, the play of the game will also be influenced by the particular response chosen. In a given scenario, there may be more than one interaction between the player and the NPC where each interaction opportunity allows the player to choose a response from a given set of possible responses. Positive and/or negative feedback may be given to the player depending on the response choices made and the type of feedback given may also have an impact on the game world. For example, positive feedback will sustain over time whereas negative feedback may produce quick results for the problem at hand, but will be unsustainable in the long run.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Background narratives will be provided for several of the key NPC advisors in the game who manage the resources in the scenarios. These background narratives will assist the player in understanding the NPC's beliefs and thereby enabling the player to use this knowledge to adapt his leadership skills and strategy accordingly. In other aspects of certain embodiments, the game will provide a location accessible by the player within which the player will be able to read or listen to material discussing leadership lessons applicable to the player's current quest. Portions of the leadership material may be locked until the player has achieved certain predefined goals within the game.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Furthermore, certain embodiments include a review of the player's progress by the ruler of the realm (a NPC). The ruler may choose, based on the player's performance in the game to that point, to coach the player and/or provide guidance on leadership decision-making or how to approach a particular in-game problem. Thus, the ruler's feedback manages the player who manages the NPCs in the various game scenarios thereby creating a feedback loop. A leadership meter may be provided to indicate how well the player is leading the NPCs.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In other embodiments, secondary gameplay may provide the player with mini-games designed to provide small boosts to the resources of a population area (village, town, city, region, kingdom, etc.) and may or may not provide a boost to the player's leadership score.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Upon completion of certain quests and scenarios, the player will reach the end of the game and may be awarded a token on a Leaderboard to signify the level of leadership skills exhibited during the game. In an embodiment, the Leaderboard may be sharable with other players. Since each player's final score is based on the player's experiences and reactions chosen during the game, and since there are multiple branching dialog sequences, the player will be enticed to play the game numerous times to maximize his or her final score. In a further embodiment, an animation replay will allow the player to view key decisions made throughout the game so that the player can choose a new strategy the next time through. In yet a further embodiment, a player may opt to choose a character with one of a preselected specific leadership profile so that the character's tendencies must be taken into account during NPC interactions.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In a particular embodiment, the player must apply the concepts of a leadership methodology in interacting with NPCs (i.e., PCS events) to determine how well the current population area performs which will factor into the player's leadership score. The overall game may include multiple story zones each with its own specific NPC with which the player will interact while in that zone. Each zone will have multiple PCS events and one or more side quests or mini-games. For each of these PCS events and/or side quests, the player's character in the game may typically be placed in a separate scenario and/or map from the overall game map. For each PCS event, there will be an introduction to the dialog for the player and during the interaction with the NPC, the player will be presented with two or more options for responding. The player must choose what he/she determines to be the most appropriate response. Each PCS event will require multiple dialog responses, so to optimize his/her score the player must succeed multiple times. Branching dialog flow allows the player to reach a particular outcome (i.e., the end of the PCS event) via different paths where each path may have a different number of NPC interactions/dialogs. Each PCS event may have multiple outcomes, such as one or more of a praise outcome, a coach outcome, or a scold outcome. Each of the outcomes has a score value associated with it where the particular score for an outcome depends on the PCS event and may be predetermined. For example, a particular PCS event may have a coach outcome for which the player is awarded two points, a scold outcome for which the player is awarded one point, and a praise outcome for which the player is awarded zero points. Another PCS event may award the player two points for reaching the praise outcome, one point for reaching the scold outcome, and zero points for reaching the coach outcome. In another embodiment, the points awarded for any two outcomes may be the same. A content of a subsequent dialog presented to the player by the NPC will depend on the player's chosen response to the previous dialog within the PCS event. As PCS events are completed, new quests will become available, some may be secondary quests and some may be primary quests (i.e., PCS events). Each of the primary quests must be completed for the player to advance to the next story zone. Some secondary quests may be pass/fail or yes/no events.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In an embodiment, an exemplary flow of events in a narrative-driven role playing game as described herein may proceed as follows, where those of skill in the art will readily understand that this is not the only possible flow of events. The player's character is placed on the game map; the player undertakes a quest (typically the player chooses amongst available quests) in which the player's character is taken from the map and placed in a situation set-up scenario where a NPC begins a dialog and a PCS event or pass/fail or yes/no event is undertaken (if so chosen by the player); the player enters responses to the NPC's questions/dialog inputs; an outcome is reached to the event; the player's score is computed based on the player's responses; the outcome of the event is displayed to the player; the game map is updated, if applicable (e.g., based on the outcome attained, a new area/level/zone may be unlocked and available to the player); and the player's character is again placed on the game map.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In an embodiment, for each PCS event, pass/fail, or yes/no event the player is awarded a quantifiable amount of points (as discussed above), which may be referred to as Leadership Influence (“LI”). In a particular embodiment, LI points are not lost once they are awarded and a State of the Kingdom metric may be determined and may be based on the ratio of LI points awarded to the total amount of LI points possible (or on a percentage basis). In a further particular embodiment, the State of the Kingdom may be based on the LI ratio and/or percentage metric such as: 0-20% is “unrest”; 20-40% is “sad”, 40-60% is “neutral”; 60-80% is “happy”; and 80-100% is “ecstatic”. Those of skill in the art will readily understand that the aforementioned figures are exemplary only. Unlockable character buffs may also be awarded, to be used at the player's discretion, based on the State of the Kingdom metric. Exemplary buffs may include: removing the worst answer from possible answers for the player to choose from in PCS events; automatically selecting the correct/best answer; and an automatic return to the game map. In some embodiment, LI points are only awarded for primary quests (i.e., PCS events).</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">With attention drawn to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary overall map schematic <b>100</b> is presented according to an embodiment of the present subject matter. In this particular embodiment, there are five “zones” through which the player must proceed to get from the starting point <b>111</b> to the finishing point <b>155</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, these zones may correspond to the size of a settlement that the player has a leadership role over, such as a village, town, city, region, and kingdom, respectively. While in each particular zone, the player may interact with a specific NPC for that zone. Additionally, the PCS events and/or side quests may become increasingly more difficult as the zone numbers increase. Typically, at the beginning of a game, only a portion of Zone <b>1</b> is visible to the player. For example, in an embodiment, only PCS event <b>111</b> may be initially visible to the player.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In the exemplary embodiment displayed in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the PCS events are placed along the horizontal line and are annotated with a number of LI points available for that particular PCS event. For example, PCS event <b>111</b> is worth a maximum of 2 points and side quest <b>114</b> is worth no LI points (although completing the side quest may result in useful information being imparted to the player). In other embodiments, the side quests may include LI points. The side quests may be hidden from the player until the player successfully completes the previously-adjoining PCS event or side quest (as shown by the dotted line arrows in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). For example, in Zone <b>5</b>, side quest <b>156</b> may not be visible to the player until PCS event <b>153</b> has been successfully completed, i.e., the player finishes all of the dialog events for PCS event <b>153</b>. It is contemplated in some embodiments that the player need not attain a score of 2 LI points in PCS event <b>153</b> in order to have the game reveal side quest <b>156</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">PCS events <b>121</b>, <b>131</b>, <b>141</b>, and <b>151</b> are shared between two zones and upon completion of, for example, PCS event <b>121</b> portions or all of Zone <b>2</b> may become visible to the player.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Now turning to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a computer-implemented method <b>200</b> for a narrative-driven role playing game for teaching leadership skills is presented. Likewise, <figref>FIG. 2</figref> may represent executable instructions for a narrative-driven role playing game for teaching leadership skills where the executable instructions may be stored on a non-transitory machine-readable medium.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">At block <b>201</b> a game engine may provide multiple zones where a first zone includes a first non-player character (“NPC”) for interacting with a player character (“Character”) controlled by a player of the narrative-driven role playing game, and where the first zone includes one or more first quests, such as a PCS event and/or a side quest, such as a pass/fail or yes/no event. At least one of the first quests is locked and not initially selectable by the player. Upon the player's completion of a predetermined one or ones of the first quests allows for the Character to proceed to a second one of the zones.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">At block <b>202</b>, the Character is entered, via the game engine, into the first zone. At block <b>203</b>, the player selects a first one of non-locked first quests. At block <b>204</b>, the Character, via the game engine, is placed in the selected first quest. At block <b>205</b>, the player interacts in the selected first quest with the first NPC in a first set of narrative-driven dialogs. At least one of the first set of narrative-driven dialogs comprises a scenario/interaction which provides leadership training or leadership skills development for the player. In an embodiment, each of the narrative-driven dialogs has a branching dialog tree. A first dialog of the first set of dialogs is presented to the player and includes a predetermined initial input by the first NPC and a first set of predetermined response options. In an embodiment, the first set of predetermined response options equals three. In a further embodiment, the response options include a praise response, a coach response, and a scold response. The player selects one of the first predetermined response options and, based on the first predetermined response option selected by the player in the first dialog, a second dialog of the first set of dialogs is presented to the player. The second dialog includes a second input by the first NPC.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">At block <b>206</b>, the player navigates through the various narrative-driven dialogs until he/she attains one of a predetermined number of first outcomes. In an embodiment, the number of first outcomes equals three. The outcome attained by the player is based on one or more responses selected by the player in the first set of narrative-driven dialogs. At block <b>207</b>, the game engine determines a first quest score for the selected first quest where the first quest score is based on the first outcome attained. In an embodiment, the first quest score is a first predetermined score awarded to the player if the player attains a first one of the first outcomes, a second predetermined score if the player attains a second one of the first outcomes, or a third predetermined score if the player attains a third one of the first outcomes. In a further embodiment, the first, second, and third predetermined scores are different. In a still further embodiment, two of the first, second, and third predetermined scores are the same. In yet a further embodiment, the score awarded to the player depends on the path the player took through the narrative-driven branching dialog tree. In still yet a further embodiment, at least one of the first, second, and third predetermined scores is independent of the path the player took through the branching dialog tree. It is also contemplated by the present disclosure that one or more of the first quests is a non-scoring quest.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In an embodiment, one of the branching dialog trees in the first set of narrative-driven dialogs includes a first path having a first number of NPC interactions for attaining a first of the predetermined number of outcomes and a second path having a second number of NPC interactions for attaining the first of the predetermined number of outcomes.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">At block <b>208</b>, the Character is placed, via the game engine, back into the first zone. At block <b>209</b>, the game engine displays to the player an effect to the first zone based on the attained first outcome. For example, the effect to the first zone may include, but is not limited to, unlocking a locked first quest, displaying additional available quests, etc. At block <b>210</b> the player selects a second one of the non-locked first quests, which may be one of the newly-unlocked quests.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">At block <b>211</b>, the Character is placed, via the game engine, into a second one of the multiple zones once the player has completed the requisite number of first quests. At block <b>212</b>, the game engine determines an aggregate score for the player based on completed selected first quests and, at block <b>213</b>, the game engine displays to the player an indication of the aggregate score, which may be a number, letter, symbol, icon, etc., or combination thereof. In an embodiment, the aggregate score is determined based on a ratio of a total score received by or awarded to the player for completed selected quests to a total possible score for the completed selected quests.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In a further embodiment, at block <b>214</b>, the game engine unlocks a game feature if the player's aggregate score is greater than a predetermined threshold. The game feature may include, as a non-limiting example, one or more buffs for use by the player in a player-selected quest. Exemplary buffs include, but are not limited to, removing one of the first set of predetermined response options for one of the dialogs in the first set of dialogs, automatically selecting one of the first set of predetermined response options for one of the dialogs in the first set of dialogs; and placing the Character, via the game engine, into the first zone to thereby avoid the remainder of the PCS event or secondary/side quest.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In an embodiment, the second one of the multiple zones includes a second NPC for interacting with the Character controlled by the player, and the second zone includes one or more second quests at least one of which is locked and not initially selectable by the player. The completion of a predetermined one or ones of the one or more second quests allows for the Character to proceed to a third one of the multiple of zones.</p>

      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">At block <b>316</b> the player selects, via the game engine, a first one of the non-locked second quests. At block <b>317</b>, the Character, via the game engine, is placed in the selected second quest. At block <b>318</b>, the player interacts in the selected second quest with the second NPC in a second set of narrative-driven dialogs. At least one of the second set of narrative-driven dialogs comprises a scenario/interaction which provides leadership training or leadership skills development for the player. In an embodiment, each of the second set of narrative-driven dialogs has a branching dialog tree. A first dialog of the second set of dialogs is presented to the player and includes a predetermined initial input by the second NPC and a second set of predetermined response options. In an embodiment, the response options include a praise response, a coach response, and a scold response. The player selects one of the second predetermined response options and, based on the selected second predetermined response option, a second dialog of the second set of dialogs is presented to the player. The second dialog includes a second input by the second NPC. In an embodiment, the first and second NPCs are the same.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">At block <b>319</b>, the player navigates through the various narrative-driven dialogs until he/she attains one of a predetermined number of second outcomes. In an embodiment, the number of second outcomes equals three. The outcome attained by the player is based on one or more responses selected by the player in the second set of narrative-driven dialogs.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">At block <b>320</b>, the game engine determines a second quest score for the selected second quest where the second quest score is based on the second outcome attained. In an embodiment, the second quest score is a first predetermined score awarded to the player if the player attains a first one of the second outcomes, a second predetermined score if the player attains a second one of the second outcomes, or a third predetermined score if the player attains a third one of the second outcomes. These scores may be the same or different than the scores described above for the first quest score. In a further embodiment, the first, second, and third predetermined scores are different. In a still further embodiment, two of the first, second, and third predetermined scores are the same. In yet a further embodiment, the score awarded to the player depends on the path the player took through the narrative-driven branching dialog tree. In still yet a further embodiment, at least one of the first, second, and third predetermined scores is independent of the path the player took through the branching dialog tree. It is also contemplated by the present disclosure that one or more of the second quests is a non-scoring quest.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In an embodiment, one of the branching dialog trees in the second set of narrative-driven dialogs includes a first path having a first number of second NPC interactions for attaining a first of the predetermined number of outcomes and a second path having a second number of second NPC interactions for attaining the first of the predetermined number of outcomes.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> depicts an exemplary branching dialog tree <b>600</b> of a narrative-driven dialog (e.g., a first set of dialogs) for one or more PCS events according to an embodiment of the present subject matter. The narrative-driven dialog begins with a first dialog (blocks <b>601</b>, <b>601</b>C, <b>601</b>P, and <b>601</b>S) and ends with one of three (in this particular embodiment) outcomes (blocks <b>610</b>, <b>620</b>, and <b>630</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The narrative-driven dialog begins at a first dialog where a NPC presents to the player a predetermined initial input at block <b>601</b> (“NPC <b>16</b>”) along with a first set of predetermined response options at blocks <b>601</b>C, <b>601</b>P, and <b>601</b>S, which represent, respectively, a coach response (“C16”), a praise response (“P16”), and a scold response (“S16”). In an embodiment, the particular response chosen by the player (for any of the dialogs) may also have an effect on one or more subsequent dialogs in the branching dialog tree <b>600</b>, such as, but not limited to, the NPC input at in a subsequent dialog and/or the number of and/or contents of choices for the predetermined response options presented to the player.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">After the player chooses one of the C16, P16, or S16 responses, the game engine continues the branching dialog tree <b>600</b> by presenting to the player a second dialog by the NPC (typically, but not necessarily, the same NPC as in the first dialog) at block <b>602</b> (“NPC26”) along with a second set of predetermined response options represented by blocks <b>602</b>C, <b>602</b>P, and <b>602</b>S (“C26”, “P26”, and “S26”, respectively). In this particular embodiment, if the player chooses either the C26 or P26 response, the player will be presented with a third dialog by the NPC at block <b>603</b> (“NPC36”) along with predetermined response options represented by blocks <b>603</b>C (“C36”), <b>603</b>P (“P36”), and <b>603</b>S (“S36”).

In the event that the third dialog is presented to the player and the player chooses the P36 response, the player will be presented with a sixth dialog by the NPC at block <b>606</b> (“NPC66”) along with predetermined response options represented by blocks <b>604</b>P (“P46”), and <b>604</b>S (“S46”). In the event that the third dialog is presented to the player and the player chooses the S36 response, the game engine will present to the player the scold outcome at block <b>630</b> (“O36”). As discussed above, the game engine may then determine a score for the player for this first set of dialogs, may place the Character back into the appropriate zone, and may also display to the player an effect to that zone based on the O36 outcome. The particular outcome achieved by the player may also have an effect on a branching dialog tree of one or more subsequent narrative-driven dialogs, such as, but not limited to, the NPC input at one or more dialogs in a subsequent branching dialog and/or the number of and/or contents of choices for the predetermined response options presented to the player.</p>

In the event that the fourth dialog is presented to the player and the player chooses the S36 response, the game engine will present to the player the scold outcome at block <b>630</b> (“O36”).</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">In the event that the fifth dialog is presented to the player and the player chooses the C46 response, the game engine will present to the player the coach outcome at block <b>610</b> (“016”). In the event that the fifth dialog is presented to the player and the player chooses the P46 response, the game engine will present to the player the praise outcome at block <b>620</b> (“O26”). In the event that the fifth dialog is presented to the player and the player chooses the S46 response, the game engine will present to the player the scold outcome at block <b>630</b> (“O36”). As discussed above, the game engine may then determine a score for the player for this first set of dialogs, based on the outcome achieved by the player, may place the Character back into the appropriate zone, and may also display to the player an effect to that zone based on the outcome achieved. The particular outcome achieved by the player may also have an effect on a branching dialog tree of one or more subsequent narrative-driven dialogs, such as, but not limited to, the NPC input at one or more dialogs in a subsequent branching dialog and/or the number of and/or contents of choices for the predetermined response options presented to the player.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">In the event that the sixth dialog is presented to the player and the player chooses the P46 response, the game engine will present to the player the praise outcome at block <b>620</b> (“O26”).
