      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="2">Description the Background Art</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Since inkjet recording is advantageous as image forming method in comparison with other recording methods in that the process is simple, full colorization is easy, and images having high resolution can be obtained by a simple structure, the inkjet recording has been diffusing. In inkjet recording, inkjet recording devices form images on recording media, typically paper, by firing a small amount of ink to deposit it on the recording medium. The utilization of inkjet recording spreads to printers or printing for personal use or industrial use.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The main stream of the ink is an aqueous ink using hydrosoluble dyes as colorants. However, the dye inks are inherently inferior in weathering property and water resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Therefore, pigment inks using pigments instead of hydrosoluble dyes have been researched. However, the pigment inks are inferior to dye inks with regard to coloring, ejection stability of ink, and storage stability. In addition, as the technologies for producing quality images by printers for office use are improved, the pigment ink is required to have the same image density as the dye ink.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">However, the pigment ink involves a problem that when plain paper is used, the pigment density on the surface of the paper lowers because the pigment permeates into paper. In attempts to increase the drying speed of an ink attached to a recording medium as a measure for high speed performance, a permeating agent is added to the ink to permeate water into the recording medium for quick drying but the permeating property of the pigment is also improved, thereby further lowering the image density.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">According to the present disclosure, an improved ink for inkjet recording is provided which contains water, an organic solvent, pigment; and a compound represented by the following Chemical formula 1:</p>

      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0020">The ink for inkjet recording of 1 mentioned above is described in detail. Since the following 2 to 9 are contained in the embodiments of the present invention, these are also described.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0021">2. The ink for inkjet recording according to 1 mentioned above, satisfying one of the following I to III:</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0022">I. the pigment which is dispersed by a dispersant having one or more kinds of hydrophilic group;</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0023">II. the pigment which is covered with a resin having one or more kinds of hydrophilic group; and</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0024">III. the pigment to which one or more kinds of hydrophilic group, an atomic group having one or more kinds of hydrophilic group, or a resin having one or more kinds of hydrophilic group is bonded.</p>

      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0027">5. The ink for inkjet recording according to any one of 1 to 4 mentioned above, wherein M<sup>+</sup>'s each, independently represent protons, cations of alkali metals, ammonium ions, or organic ammonium ions.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0028">6. The ink for inkjet recording according to any one of 1 to 5 mentioned above, wherein the compound represented by Chemical formula 1 accounts for 0.1% by weight to 15.0% by weight in the ink for ink for inkjet recording.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0029">7. The ink for inkjet recording according to any one of 1 to 6 mentioned above, wherein pH of the ink for inkjet recording ranges from 7.0 to 10.0 at 25Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0030">8. An ink container including: a container to accommodate the ink for inkjet recording of any one of 1 to 7 mentioned above.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0031">9. An inkjet recording device including: the ink container of 8 mentioned above.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0032">In general, chelator compounds or salts thereof dissolve a calcium salt such as calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate, which are little soluble.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0033">Therefore, by adding a chelator compound to an ink, the elution amount of calcium ion from paper can be increased when the ink is deposited on the paper.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0034">However, typical chelators have extremely strong affinity with calcium ions so that the calcium ions eluted strongly bond with chelator compounds. Therefore, pigments do not agglomerate even when the dispersability of the pigments is lowered as a result of reaction with functional groups (hydrophilic groups) that disperse the pigments, so that the image density is not improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0035">As a result of an investigation to solve this problem, it was found that, by using the compound represented by Chemical formula 1 as an additive of an ink, both an increase of elution amount of calcium ion from paper and reactivity of hydrophilic functional groups that disperse eluted calcium ions and pigments were secured.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0036">Consequently, it was found that the image density becomes high and the occurrence of strike-through is reduced even for plain paper having a low content ratio of hydrosoluble multivalent metal salts or only little-soluble metal salts.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0037">Furthermore, it was also found that ejection reliability is high because pigments agglomerate as a result of reaction between ink and paper without causing agglomeration of the pigments prior to ejection of the ink and the pigments dried at nozzles do not easily agglomerate.</p>

It is preferable to use an acidic carbon black having a pH of 6 or less, in particular 4 or less, for an aqueous pigment ink. Acidic carbon black is obtained by moderately oxidizing carbon black for color such as furness black or channel black by an oxidization method using a typical oxidizing agent (such as nitric acid, ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and nitrogen oxide,) or a surface reforming method such as plasma treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0122">Specific examples of such acidic carbon black available on market include, but are not limited to, MA100, 2400B, and MA8 (all manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation) and ColorBlack FW200 (manufactured by Degussa AG). To oxidize the thus-obtained acidic carbon black, a hypohalous acid salt is used. To be specific, sodium hypochlorite and otassium sodium hypochlorite are used. Sodium hypochlorite is particularly preferable in terms of reactivity. Oxidation of acidic carbon black is generally conducted by placing acidic carbon black and a hypohalous acid salt (for example, sodium hypochlorite) having an effective halogen concentration of from 10% to 30% to the mass of the carbon black in water followed by stirring for five hours or more, preferably about 10 to about 15 hours at 50Â° C. or higher, preferably from 95Â° C. to 105Â° C.

The thus-obtained surface reforming pigment can be used for various purposes such as ink, inkjet ink, paint, toner, plastic, and rubber.

When the amount of ink remaining in the sub-tank <b>135</b> is detected to be approaching to empty, a predetermined amount of the ink is replenished to the sub tank <b>135</b> from the ink container <b>200</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0246">In this inkjet recording device, it is possible to dissemble the chassis of the ink container <b>200</b> and replace the ink accommodating unit therein when the ink is used up in the ink container <b>200</b>. In addition, the ink container <b>200</b> stably supplies the ink even when the ink container <b>200</b> is placed on its side and installed by front loading.</p>
      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0247">Therefore, even when the upside of the inkjet recording device <b>101</b> is blocked, for example, it is placed in a rack or something is placed on the upper surface of the inkjet recording device <b>101</b>, the ink container <b>200</b> is easily exchanged.</p>

      <p id="p-00243-en" num="0251">On the recorded matter of the present disclosure, information or an image is recorded on a recording medium by using the ink of the present disclosure. The recorded matter of the present disclosure can be manufactured by a process of discharging an ink from an inkjet head to record on a recording medium.</p>
      <p id="p-00244-en" num="0252">There is no specific limit to the selection of the recording medium, which can be selected to a particular application. For examples, plain paper, coated paper for printing, gloss paper, special paper, cloth, film, and transparent sheets can be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00245-en" num="0253">These may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof. Of these, plain paper or coted paper for printing is preferable. It is particularly preferable that the ink of the present disclosure is used for paper having an eluted amount of calcium ion of from 1.0Ã10<sup>â4 </sup>to 5.0Ã10<sup>â4 </sup>(g/g). Plain paper is advantageous because it is inexpensive. Moreover, coated paper for printing is relatively inexpensive to gloss paper and advantageous in that smooth images with gloss are printed. However, plain paper and coated paper for printing are not dried well. For this reason, in general, they are not practically suitable for inkjet printing. However, according to the ink of the present disclosure, drying property is improved so that such recording media can be suitably used.</p>
      <p id="p-00246-en" num="0254">The recorded matter of the present disclosure is of high quality blur-free image and excellent in stability over time so that it can be suitably used for various purposes such as references, on which texts, images, etc. are recorded.</p>

      <p id="p-00248-en" num="0256">Next, the present disclosure is described in detail with reference to Examples and Comparative Examples but not limited thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00249-en" num="0257">The weight average molecular weight and viscosity of the resins in Examples were measured as follows.</p>
      <p id="p-00250-en" num="0258">Weight Average Molecular Weight of Resin</p>
      <p id="p-00251-en" num="0259">The weight average molecular weight of a resin was measured by the following method. The weight average molecular weight was measured according to GPC method using a column constant temperature tank (CTO-20A, manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation), a detector (RID-10A, manufactured by SHIMADZU CORPORATION), an eluent flowing path pump (LC-20AD, manufactured by SHIMADZU Corporation), a deflating equipment (Degasser DGU-20A, manufactured by SHIMADZU COPORATION), and an autosampler (SIL-20A, manufactured by SHIMADZU COPORATION). The column used was formed by connecting an aqueous SEC column TSKgel G3000 PWXL (elimination limit molecule quantity: 2Ã10<sup>5</sup>), TSKgel G5000 PWXL (elimination limit molecule quantity: 2.5Ã10<sup>5</sup>), and TSKgel G6000 PWXL (elimination limit molecule quantity: 5Ã10<sup>5</sup>) (all manufactured by TOSOH CORPORATION). A sample was adjusted to be 2 g/100 ml by an eluent and used for measurement. An aqueous solution adjusted to have 0.5 mol/L of each of acetic acid and sodium acetate were used as the eluent. The column temperature was 40Â° C. and the flowing speed is 1.0 m/L.</p>
      <p id="p-00252-en" num="0260">Viscosity of Resin</p>
      <p id="p-00253-en" num="0261">With regard to the synthesized resin, the viscosity of 10% by weight aqueous solution thereof was measured at 25Â° C. by using a rotation viscometer (Viscometer RE550L, Cone plate type, manufactured by TOM SANGYO CO., LTD.). To be specific, 1.1 mL of the resin was taken and placed in a sample cup of the viscometer. This was mounted to the viscometer and thereafter stood still for one minute. Thereafter, the rotor of the viscometer was rotated to read the value one minute later. The number of rotation at the time of viscosity measuring was controlled to be constant in the torque range of from 40% to 80%.</p>

      <p id="p-00278-en" num="0278">500 parts of a solvent 1-methoxy-2-propanol, 30 parts of phosmer M represented by Chemical structure 4 illustrated below (manufactured by Uni-Chemical Co., Ltd.), 10 parts of diacetone acrylamide (manufactured by Nihon Kasei CO., LTD.), 60 parts of 1-vinyl naphthalene (manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), and 4 parts of a polymerization initiator (azobis isobutylonitrile) were charged in a flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, and a nitrogen-introducing tube followed by heating to 65Â° C. for polymerization in nitrogen atmosphere for 15 hours. Thereafter, after distilling away about a half of the solvent, the resultant was charged into a large quantity of methanol to precipitate Resin 2. Furthermore, the precipitated Resin 2 having an acid group was dried. The resin 2 having an acid group had a weight average molecular weight of 30,000. While diluting the thus-obtained polymer with water, potassium hydroxide was added to achieve 100% acid neutralization. Thereafter, the concentration of the resultant was adjusted with water in such a manner that the concentration of the solid portion was 10% by weight. As a result, the Resin 2 was synthesized, in which the phosphoric acid group was 100% neutralized. The viscosity of 10% by weight aqueous solution of the obtained resin at 25Â° C. was 2.8 mPaÂ·s.</p>

The Phosmer M (manufactured by Uni-Chemical Co., Ltd.) represented by Chemical structure 4 was stirred with acidic Amberlite resin washed with DMSO to remove impurities for 14 hours to be dissolved in DMSO (7% solid portion). Butyl acrylate and nitrophenyl acrylamide were dissolved in this solution with a mass ratio of the monomers of 28.7% by weight of phosmer M, 68.3% by weight of butyl acrylate, and 3% by weight of nitrophenyl acrylamide. A flask equipped with a heating mantle controlled by thermocouple thermostat, a dripping funnel, and frosted glass joint with a barrier membrane cap on was filled with one tenth of the total amount of the DMSO solution of the monomer. The rest (=nine tenths) of the DMSO solution of the monomer was placed in the dripping funnel. A hypodermic syringe was filled with DMSO solution of 10% by weight 4,4â²-azobis cyano valeric acid (ACVA) containing ACVA accounting for 3% by weight to the total amount of the monomer contained in the total amount of the initially prepared DMSO solution of the monomer. The reaction mixture was heated to 105Â° C. and one tenth of the 10 by weight ACVA solution was added to the reaction mixture. The DMSO solution of the monomer in the dripping funnel and the rest (nine tenths) of the 10% by weight ACVA solution were added every half an hour for five hours. Thereafter, the temperature was maintained at 105Â° C. for one hour followed by cooling down. The thus-obtained resin (containing repeating units having phosphoric acid group) was precipitated in 5% by weight acetic acid water and the precipitation was extracted. The solid portion was washed with distilled water twice. The viscosity of 10% by weight aqueous solution of the obtained resin was 1.9 mPaÂ·s. The resin was purged in tetrahydrofuran solution (10% solid portion) by nitrogen to be hydrogenerated. 2.5 g of 10% supported palladium activated carbon was added to the solution to hydrogenerate the mixture at 45 psi for 3 to 4 hours by Parr device. The thus-obtained resin was used as was for preparation for reformed pigments.</p>

The mixture was stirred with a propeller blade and a rotor stator and heated to 55Â° C. 0.25 g of sodium nitrite was dissolved in 16 g of water in another container. 0.35 g of methanesulfonic acid was added to the stirred mixture and the sodium nitrite solution was dripped thereto in five minutes. The mixture was maintained by stirring for two hours at 55Â° C. Next, the resultant mixture was added to and stirred in a polyethylene container having 800 mL of THF by a hand method. The thus-obtained solid portion was collected by centrifugal followed by washing with THF twice. The solid portion was dispersed in 500 mL of water having a pH of 9 for 30 minutes by using a sonic probe. The thus-produced dispersion material was filtered with a sieve having an opening size of 20 micron and diafiltrated by the amount (10 times: about 5 litter) of water for size classification. Thus, a self-dispersion pigment dispersion element 3-1 having a phosphoric acid group as hydrophilic group with a pigment concentration of 16% was obtained.</p>

When an obtained slurry had a pH of 4 or higher, 20 mmol of nitric acid was added. 30 minutes later, 20 mmol of sodium nitrite dissolved in a minute amount of deionized highly pure water was slowly added to the mixture. Furthermore, the temperature was raised to 60Â° C. while being stirred to conduct reaction for one hour. A reformed pigment can be produced in which the compound represented by Chemical structure 5 illustrated below is added to the carbon black. Thereafter, by adjusting the pH to be 10 by NaOH aqueous solution, a dispersion element of reformed pigment was obtained 30 minutes later. A dispersion element containing a pigment bonded with at least one geminal-bisphosphonic acid group or a sodium salt of geminal bisphosphonic acid and deionized highly pure water were subject to ultrafiltration using a dialysis membrane followed by ultrasonic wave dispersion to obtain Pigment dispersion element 3-3 of self dispersion type having a bisphosphonic acid group as a hydrophilic group with a pigment concentration of 16%.</p>

When this was dissolved, 100 g of 1-aminobenzene-3,4,5-tricarboxylic acid was added and dissolved. After neutralization heat ceased, the reaction result was cooled down to 10Â° C. The dripping funnel was filled with 40.23 g of methacryloyl chloride. While this was maintained below 15Â° C., the liquid was dripped to the reaction container in 15 minutes. 40 g of sodium hydroxide was dissolved in 150 g of water in another container. This solution was added to the reaction mixture 20 minutes after the addition of methacryloyl chloride was complete. After the reaction product was cooled down to 10Â° C., 40 g of methacryloyl chloride was dripped from the dripping funnel in 15 minutes while the temperature was maintained below 15Â° C. 20 minutes after the dripping was complete, the reaction mixture was acidized to pH 3 by strong chloric acid. The thus-produced solid portion was extracted by vacuum filtration followed by washing with ethanol and dried at 60Â° C. for 14 hours in a vacuum oven. Synthesis of Resin</p>
      <p id="p-00321-en" num="0317">A copolymer was prepared by using a semi-continuous supplying method. The monomer of acrylamide-benzene tricarboxylic acid was stirred with acidic Amberlite resin washed with DMSO to remove impurities for 14 hours to be dissolved in DMSO (7% solid portion). Butyl acrylate and nitrophenyl acryl amide were dissolved in this solution with a mass ratio of the monomers of 28.7% by weight of monomer of acrylamide-benzene tricarboxylic acid, 68.3% by weight of butyl acrylate, and 3% by weight of nitrophenyl acrylamide. A small quantity (3% by weight based of the total monomer supply amount) of mesitylene was added to obtain internal reference material of NMR analysis. A flask equipped with a heating mantle controlled by thermocouple thermostat, a dripping funnel, and frosted glass joint with a barrier membrane cap on was filled with one tenth of the total amount of the DMSO solution of the monomer.

      <p id="p-00334-en" num="0325">An inkjet printer (IPSIO GXe 5500, manufactured by Ricoh Company LTD.) was used to eject ink in such a manner that the same amount of the ink was ejected and attached to a recording medium by fluctuating the drive voltage of piezoelectric elements to conduct the following printing evaluation.</p>
      <p id="p-00335-en" num="0326">Image Density and Strike-through</p>
      <p id="p-00336-en" num="0327">A chart having general symbols of 64 point JIS X 0208 (1997), 2223 formed by Microsoft Word 2003 was printed on MyPaper (manufactured by Ricoh Company Ltd.) by using each ink and thereafter the colors of the symbol portions were measured for evaluating the image density. The printing mode was: âPlain PaperâCleanâ by a driver installed in the printer. The image density of each color was evaluated according to the following criteria. For evaluation, the four measuring points per color per chart were measured once and the average of the four points were determined as the measuring results. Incidentally, the symbols of JIS X 0208 (1997), 2223 had squares for the exterior and the inside thereof was entirely painted by ink</p>
