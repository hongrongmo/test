      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Bioprinting (e.g., organ printing) is an area of research and engineering that involves printing devices, such as modified ink-jet printers, that deposit biological materials. The technology involves the rapid creation and release of liquid droplets comprising cells followed by their precise deposition on a substrate. Tissues and organs engineered using basic cellular materials by means of bioprinting represent a promising alternative to donor-derived tissues and organs used today in standard transplantation approaches.</p>

      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Provided herein are methods for forming three-dimensional tissues in vivo. In one embodiment, provided herein is a method for forming a three-dimensional tissue in vivo, comprising depositing on a surface that is in or on a subject at least one composition that comprises cells. In another embodiment, provided herein is a method for forming a three-dimensional tissue in vivo, comprising depositing on a surface that is in or on a subject at least one composition that comprises cells and at least one composition that comprises an extracellular matrix (ECM). In another embodiment, provided herein is a method for forming a three-dimensional tissue in vivo, comprising depositing on a surface that is in or on a subject at least one composition that comprises cells, at least one composition that comprises an extracellular matrix (ECM), and at least one other additional components. Cells that may be used in accordance with the methods described herein are described in Section 4.1.1, below. Tissues and Organs onto which cells, ECM, and/or other additional components can be deposited in accordance with the methods described herein are described in Section 4.1.2, below. ECM that may be used in accordance with the methods described herein is described in Section 4.1.3, below. Surfaces onto which cells, ECM, and/or additional components may be deposited in accordance with the methods described herein are described in Section 4.1.4, below.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In one embodiment, the cells and ECM used in the methods for forming three-dimensional tissues in vivo described herein are deposited as part of the same composition. In another embodiment, the cells and ECM used in the methods for forming three-dimensional tissues in vivo described herein are deposited as part of different compositions. In a specific embodiment, the ECM used in the methods for forming three-dimensional tissues in vivo described herein comprises flowable ECM. In another specific embodiment, the cells and ECM used in the methods for forming three-dimensional tissues in vivo described herein are deposited as part of different compositions, for example, wherein the ECM is deposited separate from, e.g., before, the deposition of the cells, and/or wherein the ECM is dehydrated prior to the deposition of the cells.

In a specific embodiment, the surface comprises a synthetic material, e.g., a synthetic polymer. In another specific embodiment, the synthetic polymer is PCL.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In certain embodiments, the cells and ECM (e.g., a flowable ECM) are not deposited concurrently, but are deposited in layers. In a specific embodiment, a layer of cells is deposited on a surface in or on a subject, followed by the deposition of a layer of ECM on the surface in or on the subject. In another specific embodiment, a layer of ECM is deposited on a surface in or on a subject, followed by the deposition of a layer of cells on the surface in or on the subject. In certain embodiments, multiple layers of ECM can be deposited on a surface in or on a subject followed by the deposition of multiple layers of cells on the surface in or on the subject, and vice versa. Likewise, additional components that are deposited concurrently with, before, or after the deposition of cells and/or ECM may be layered among cells and ECM in accordance with the methods described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In certain embodiments, the cells and ECM (e.g., a flowable ECM) are deposited such that the surface in or on a subject being deposited on is wholly covered by both cells and ECM. In other embodiments, the cells and ECM (e.g., a flowable ECM) are deposited such that the surface in or on a subject being deposited on is partially covered by both cells and ECM.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In certain embodiments, the cells and ECM (e.g., a flowable ECM) are deposited such that the surface in or on a subject being deposited on is covered by cells in specific, desired areas; and covered by ECM in specific, desired areas, wherein such specific areas may or may not overlap.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">In certain embodiments, the cells and ECM (e.g., a flowable ECM) may be deposited/printed onto a surface three dimensionally. As used herein âthree-dimensional printingâ or âthree-dimensional depositionâ refers to the process of printing/depositing such that, e.g., the print heads of a bioprinter move below, above, and around a three-dimensional surface (e.g., an organ or bone in a subject), e.g., the printer heads are mechanically controlled so as to rotate along a specified path. As used herein, three-dimensional printing and three-dimensional deposition is in contrast to standard methods of bioprinting that are known in the art, where the printing is performed by starting to build tissue on a flat/planar/two-dimensional surface.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">4.1 Bioprinting</heading>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">âBioprinting,â as used herein, generally refers to the deposition of living cells, as well as other components (e.g., a flowable ECM; synthetic matrices) onto a surface using standard or modified printing technology, e.g., ink jet printing technology. Basic methods of depositing cells onto surfaces, and of bioprinting cells, including cells in combination with hydrogels, are described in Warren et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,986,739, Boland et al. U.S. Pat. No. 7,051,654, Yoo et al. US 2009/0208466 and Xu et al. US 2009/0208577, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated by reference herein their entirety. Additionally, bioprinters suitable for the methods described herein are commercially available, e.g., the 3D-Bioplotterâ¢ from Envisiontec GmbH (Gladbeck, Germany); and the NovoGen MMX Bioprinterâ¢ from Organovo (San Diego, Calif.).</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The bioprinter used in the methods described herein may include mechanisms and/or software that enables control of the temperature, humidity, shear force, speed of printing, and/or firing frequency, by modifications of, e.g., the printer driver software and/or the physical makeup of the printer. In certain embodiments, the bioprinter software and/or hardware preferably may be constructed and/or set to maintain a cell temperature of about 37Â° C. during printing.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In certain embodiments, the inkjet printing device may include a two-dimensional or three-dimensional printer. In certain embodiments, the bioprinter comprises a DC solenoid inkjet valve, one or more reservoir for containing one or more types of cells, e.g., cells in a flowable composition, and/or ECM (e.g., a flowable ECM) prior to printing, e.g., connected to the inkjet valve. The bioprinter may have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more reservoirs, e.g., one for each cell type or each ECM used to construct the tissues and organs described herein. The cells may be delivered from the reservoir to the inkjet valve by air pressure, mechanical pressure, or by other means. Typically, the bioprinter, e.g., the print heads in the bioprinter, is/are computer-controlled such that the one or more cell types, and said ECM, are deposited in a predetermined pattern. Said predetermined pattern can be a pattern that recreates or recapitulates the natural arrangement of said one or more types of cells in an organ or tissue from which the cells are derived or obtained, or a pattern that is different from the natural arrangement of said one or more types of cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In certain embodiments, the bioprinter used in the methods provided herein may be a thermal bubble inkjet printer, see, e.g., Niklasen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,537,567, or a piezoelectric crystal vibration print head, e.g., using frequencies up to 30 kHz and power sources ranging from 12 to 100 Watts. Bioprinter print head nozzles, in some embodiments, are each independently between 0.05 and 200 micrometers in diameter, or between 0.5 and 100 micrometers in diameter, or between 10 and 70 micrometers in diameter, or between 20 and 60 micrometers in diameter. In further embodiments, the nozzles are each independently about 40 or 50 micrometers in diameter. Multiple nozzles with the same or different diameters may be used. In some embodiments the nozzles have a circular opening; in other embodiments, other suitable shapes may be used, e.g., oval, square, rectangle, etc., without departing from the spirit of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In certain embodiments, the bioprinter used in accordance with the methods described herein comprises a plurality of print heads and/or a plurality of print jets, wherein said plurality of print heads or print jets may, in certain embodiments, be separately controllable. In certain embodiments, each of said print heads or print jets operates independently from the remaining said print heads or print jets. In certain embodiments, at least one of said plurality of print heads or plurality of print jets may print compositions comprising cells, and at least one of said plurality of print heads or plurality of print jets may print compositions comprising ECM. In certain embodiments, at least one of said plurality of print heads or plurality of print jets may print compositions comprising cells, at least one of said plurality of print heads or plurality of print jets may print compositions comprising ECM, and at least one of said plurality of print heads or plurality of print jets may print compositions comprising an additional component.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In certain embodiments, one or more print heads or print jets of a bioprinter used in accordance with the methods described herein may be modified so that it is suitable for printing on certain surface. For example, a print head or print jet may be modified by attaching it to a certain surgical instrument, e.g., a laparoscope. In accordance with such embodiments, the surgical instrument may be fitted with one or more other components that aid in the printing procedure, e.g., a camera.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In certain embodiments, an anatomical image of the tissue or organ to be printed on may be constructed using software, e.g., a computer-aided design (CAD) software program. In accordance with such embodiments, programs can be generated that allow for three-dimensional printing on a three-dimensional surface that is representative of the structure of the tissue or organ to be printed on. For example, if it is desired to print on a bone, an anatomical image of the bone may be constructed and a program may be generated that directs the printer heads of the bioprinter to rotate around the three-dimensional bone inside the subject surface during printing.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In certain embodiments, the surface of the tissue or organ to be printed on is scanned in or on said the subject so as to form a surface map, and said surface map is used to guide the depositing of the cells, ECM, and/or any additional components to be printed. Such scanning may comprise, without limitation, the use of a laser, electron beam, magnetic resonance imaging, microwave, or computed tomography. The scan of said surface may comprise a resolution of least 1000, 100, 10, 1, or 0.1 microns.</p>

Exemplary cell types that can be used in accordance with such methods are provided in Section 4.1.1, below. ECM, including flowable ECM, is described in Section 4.1.3, below.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In other embodiments, the methods of bioprinting provided herein comprise the deposition of multiple (e.g., two, three, four, five or more) cell types and flowable ECM on a surface in or on a subject. In a specific embodiment, the multiple cell types are deposited as part of the same composition, i.e., the source of the cells is a single composition that comprises the multiple cell types. In another specific embodiment, the multiple cell types are deposited as part of different compositions, i.e., the source of the cells are distinct compositions that comprise the multiple cell types. In another specific embodiment, a portion of the multiple cell types are deposited as part of one composition (e.g., two or more cell types are in a single composition) and another portion of the multiple types are deposited as a different composition (e.g., one or more cell types are in a single composition). Exemplary cell types that can be used in accordance with such methods are provided in Section 4.1.2, below.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In a specific embodiment, the cells to be deposited and the flowable ECM are deposited on a surface in or on a subject together (e.g., simultaneously) as part of the same composition. In another specific embodiment, the cells to be deposited and the flowable ECM are deposited on a surface in or on a subject together as part of different compositions. In another specific embodiment, the cells to be deposited and the flowable ECM are deposited on a surface in or on a subject separately (e.g., at different times).</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In certain embodiments, the cells and flowable ECM are deposited on a surface in or on a subject with one or more additional components. In one embodiment, the one or more additional components are formulated in the same composition as the cells. In another embodiment, the one or more additional components are formulated in the same composition as the ECM. In another embodiment, the one or more additional components are formulated in the same composition as the cells and the ECM (i.e., a single composition comprises the cells, the flowable ECM, and the one or more additional components). In another embodiment, the one or more additional components are formulated in a composition that is separate from the compositions comprising the cells and/or ECM, and is deposited concurrently with, before, or after the deposition of the cells and/or ECM on a surface in or on a subject. In a specific embodiment, the one or more additional components promote the survival, differentiation, proliferation, etc. of the cell(s). In another specific embodiment, the one or more additional components comprise a cross-linker (see Section 4.1.3.2). In another specific embodiment, the one or more additional components comprise a hydrogel. In another specific embodiment, the one or more additional components comprise a synthetic polymer.</p>

It also will be recognized by those of skill in the art that the printing may be simultaneous or sequential, or any combination thereof and that some of the components (e.g., cells, flowable ECM, or additional components) may be printed in the form of a first pattern and some of the components may be printed in the form of a second pattern, and so on. The particular combination and manner of printing will depend upon the particular tissue or organ in a subject that is being printed on.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In certain embodiments, the cells, ECM, and/or any other materials (e.g., synthetic matrices, e.g., PCL) may be bioprinted in a specified pattern so as to yield a desired result. For example, bioprinted materials (e.g., cells, ECM, matrices, and other components described herein) may be bioprinted in layers at varying angles so as to generate specific desirable patterns, such as three-dimensional structures having specific pore sizes. In a specific embodiment, bioprinted materials (e.g., cells, ECM, matrices, and other components described herein) are printed in a criss-cross fashion so as to generate a bioprinted structure with pores of desired sizes that appear box-like. In another specific embodiment, bioprinted materials (e.g., cells, ECM, matrices, and other components described herein) are printed angles, so as to generate pores of desired sizes that appear triangular or diamond-like. For example, bioprinted materials (e.g., cells, ECM, matrices, and other components described herein) at angles of specific degrees, e.g., 30 degree angles, 45 degree angles, 60 degree angles, in order to generate desired patterns. In accordance with such methods of printing, bioprinted structures having desirable qualities, e.g., the ability to foster cellular growth and proliferation, can be generated. See Example 1, below. In a specific embodiment, matrices, e.g., synthetic matrices are bioprinted in specific patterns that are conducive to supporting the growth and proliferation of cells on said bioprinted matrices.

      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0194">This example demonstrates that synthetic material can be bioprinted to produce scaffolds of controlled fiber diameter and pore size, and that such scaffolds provide a suitable substrate for the application of extracellular matrix (ECM). This example further demonstrates that scaffolds comprising bioprinted synthetic material and ECM (hybrid scaffolds) represent a suitable substrate for the attachment and growth of cells, including placental cells, such as placental stem cells.</p>
      <heading id="h-00021-en" level="1">5.1.1 Methods</heading>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0195">To fabricate hybrid scaffolds comprising synthetic material and ECM, polycaprolactone (PCL) (Mn 45,000, Sigma) was first printed into scaffolds (54Ã54'0.64 mm) using a bioprinter (EnvisionTEC, Gladbeck, Germany). The printing conditions were as follows: temperature at 90Â° C., printing pressure 3-5.5 bar, printing speed 2-6 mm/s, with suitable size needles. ECM was isolated from human placenta as previously described (see, e.g., Bhatia M B, Wounds 20, 29, 2008). Isolated ECM was applied to both sides of the bioprinted PCL scaffolds and allowed to dry (dehydrate) so as to generate hybrid scaffolds comprising PCL and ECM. The resultant hybrid PCL-ECM scaffolds were punched into 10 mm diameter disks, pre-wet with media overnight, and seeded with placental stem cells prepared in accordance with the methods described herein (see, e.g., Section 4.1.1) at 12,500 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. The cells were cultured over an 8-day time period. Calcein staining and MTS proliferation assays were performed in accordance with standard protocols at different time points (n=<b>3</b>) to determine cell viability and proliferation.</p>
      <heading id="h-00022-en" level="1">5.1.2 Results</heading>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0196">By optimizing printing conditions, PCL scaffolds of different fiber sizes, pore sizes and pore structures were generated (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>). The printed fibers formed a stable network for the generation of hybrid scaffolds comprising PCL and ECM. Further, the printing of varying fiber sizes and pore structures made it possible to make hybrid scaffolds comprising various properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0197">Dehydration of ECM on both sides of the bioprinted PCL scaffolds resulted in the generation of hybrid scaffolds. Good integration was seen between the PCL and ECM; no separation between the PCL and ECM was noticed when the hybrid scaffolds were manipulated by processing or culturing of the scaffolds, which included rehydration (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0198">The placental stem cells spread over the surface of the hybrid scaffolds over time, and covered the majority of the surface of the hybrid scaffolds by day 6 of culture. The MTS cell proliferation assay demonstrated that cell number significantly increased over time (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). In addition, the placental stem cells seeded on the hybrid scaffolds demonstrated good viability over the 8 day culture period, as indicated by calcein staining (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>). Together, these data indicate that PCL-ECM hybrid scaffolds support cellular attachment, survival, and growth.</p>

      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0199">This example demonstrates that hybrid scaffolds comprising ECM and synthetic material (PCL) can be generated by methods that comprise bioprinting, and that cells not only attach to such scaffolds, but survive and proliferate when cultured on such scaffolds.</p>

As demonstrated by this Example, the bioprinted cells not only survive the bioprinting process, but proliferate over time in culture with the hybrid scaffolds.</p>
      <heading id="h-00026-en" level="1">5.2.1 Methods</heading>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0201">ECM was prepared as described in Example 1 and mixed with 0.5% alginate hydrogel containing 1 million/ml placental stem cells. Next, PCL and the cell-containing ECM were bioprinted, in layers, to generate a hybrid scaffold comprising PCL and ECM. In each layer of the scaffold, PCL was first printed, then the ECM/cell component was printed to fill the gaps in between the PCL lines. Two or five of such layers were printed and crosslinked with CaCl<sub>2 </sub>solution to generate the hybrid scaffolds. The bioprinted, cell-containing scaffolds (cells/ECM/PCL) were cultured for seven days, and cell proliferation and survival were assessed at various time points via calcein staining and an MTS cell proliferation assay.</p>
      <heading id="h-00027-en" level="1">5.2.2 Results</heading>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0202">The bioprinted scaffolds maintained an intact structure throughout the duration of cell culture (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>). PCL provided a good structural support for the ECM hydrogels, which allowed for the generation of three-dimensional constructs. Following bioprinting and throughout culture, the cells were well-distributed throughout the three-dimensional constructs; cells were found throughout the depth of the scaffolds during culture (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00203-en" num="0203">The placental stem cells survived the bioprinting process and continued to proliferate in the three-dimensional bioprinted hybrid scaffolds throughout culture, as evidenced by calcein staining (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>). As shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, most of the cells were found to spread throughout the ECM in the hybrid scaffolds, indicating that the ECM enhanced cell attachment and spreading in the ECM hydrogel. This was confirmed by comparing the location of cells in alginate alone with that of the cells in the scaffolds. Additionally, as shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, an MTS cell proliferation assay demonstrated increases in cell number for both the 2-layer and 5-layer scaffolds, indicating that these hybrid scaffolds supported cell growth.</p>
      <heading id="h-00028-en" level="1">5.2.3 Conclusion</heading>
      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0204">This example demonstrates that hybrid scaffolds comprising ECM and synthetic material (PCL) can be generated by methods that comprise simultaneous bioprinting of ECM and PCL. Also demonstrated by this Example is the fact that cells can be bioprinted along with the components of the hybrid scaffold (ECM and PCL), and that the cells survive the bioprinting process. Further, the cells bioprinted along with the components of the hybrid scaffold proliferate when cultured on such scaffolds and intersperse throughout the scaffolds better than when cultured in cellular matrix (alginate) alone.</p>

The scaffolds then were cultured in DMEM medium containing 15% fetal calf serum in a cell culture incubator in 6 well plates (3 to 5 ml of medium per well). At different time points, the scaffolds were harvested for calcein staining and MTS proliferation assays, to characterize cell viability and cell proliferation, respectively. <figref>FIG. 10</figref> shows the structure of the bio-printed scaffolds.</p>
      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0207">Calcein staining demonstrated that the Î²-TC-6 cells survived the printing process and remained viable during culture. A cross-sectional view of the scaffolds showed that the cells distributed evenly throughout the scaffolds, and remained alive in each layer (see <figref>FIG. 10</figref>). The MTS assay confirmed that the insulin producing Î²-TC-6 cells remained viable for up to 3 weeks, with the overall number of viable cells remaining constant (see <figref>FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00208-en" num="0208">To determine whether the Î²-TC-6 cells could function in the bioprinted scaffold, insulin production by the cells was measured. To measure insulin production, the bio-printed scaffolds were exposed to fresh growth medium (3 ml/well in a 6-well plate) for 2 hours and aliquots of the supernatant from each scaffold were measured for insulin concentration using a mouse insulin ELISA kit (Millipore). The highest level of insulin produced was detected at day 0 (see <figref>FIG. 12</figref>). The levels of secreted insulin decreased in culture afterwards (day-3 and day-6) but remained stable from day 3 to day 6 in the culture (see <figref>FIG. 12</figref>). Thus, the Î²-TC-6 cells maintained the ability to produce and secrete insulin after being bioprinted.</p>
      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0209">A key function of insulin producing cells in the pancreas is to produce insulin in response to increased glucose levels in the blood. It was thus examined whether the bioprinted scaffolds comprising PCL, ECM, and Î²-TC-6 cells retained this function by exposing the scaffolds to a glucose surge challenge (see <figref>FIG. 13</figref>). One scaffold (âAâ of <figref>FIG. 13</figref>) was exposed to glucose starvation conditions (IMDM medium without glucose, 10% FCS) for two days and then challenged with an insulin producing condition (50 mM glucose/1 mM IBMX). As controls, bioprinted scaffolds were maintained in normal culture medium with steady glucose levels (âBâ and âCâ of <figref>FIG. 13</figref>). In the controls, the medium was changed at the same time that the challenge with an insulin producing condition was performed for the test scaffold (i.e., A of <figref>FIG. 13</figref>). The supernatant from each culture (A, B, and C) was sampled every half hour and the insulin concentration from each supernatant was measured by ELISA. <figref>FIG. 13</figref> shows the levels of insulin production from each culture at the different time points and demonstrates that the bioprinted scaffold exposed to glucose starvation conditions followed by challenge with an insulin producing condition (i.e., A of <figref>FIG. 13</figref>) produced greater than 80-fold more insulin after 3 hours after challenge as compared to its level of insulin production at 0.5 hours post-challenge, while the controls (i.e., B and C of <figref>FIG. 13</figref>) produced much less insulin (only approximately 2-fold more insulin after 3 hours following media change as compared to the level of insulin production at 0.5 hour post-media change).</p>
      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0210">This Example demonstrates that bioprinted scaffolds comprising synthetic material, cells, and ECM can be generated and that the cells of the bioprinted scaffolds remain both viable and functional.</p>
