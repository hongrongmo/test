      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Dry adhesives allow for firm attachment onto a substrate and easy detachment from the substrate. Dry adhesives continue to have certain improved properties as compared to other categories of adhesives, such as hot melt adhesives, solvent based adhesives, polymer dispersion adhesives, chemically curing adhesives, and pressure sensitive adhesives. PCT Publication No. WO 2014/025793 discloses certain advances made in the manufacture of dry adhesives.

      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Embodiments of the invention are based, at least in part, on the discovery of a dry adhesive formed by mechanically interlocking a first plurality of substantially aligned fiber segments with a second plurality of substantially aligned fiber segments. In one or more embodiments, a first plurality of substantially aligned fibers comprises the first plurality of substantially aligned fiber segments and a second plurality of substantially aligned fibers comprises the second plurality of substantially aligned fiber segments. In one or more embodiments, a single plurality of substantially aligned fibers is provided, where the plurality has a first end region and a second end region, where the first end region and the second end region are mechanically interlocked. In one or more embodiments, a first plurality of aligned fibers is mechanically interlocked with a second plurality of aligned fibers. In certain advantageous embodiments, a dry adhesive is formed using a semi-batch or a continuous process. In one or more embodiments, the fibers are formed by an electrospinning process. A dry adhesive having substantially aligned polymeric nanofibers and one or more methods of making will now be described in greater detail. It should be noted that the specific materials and the specific process conditions disclosed in the following disclosures are given only as examples within the scope of the invention, and this invention should not be limited to these materials or process conditions as such.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a first fiber mat, generally indicated by the numeral <b>12</b>, includes a plurality of substantially aligned fibers <b>14</b> on a face stock <b>16</b>. A second fiber mat, generally indicated by the numeral <b>18</b>, includes a plurality of substantially aligned fibers <b>20</b> on a face stock <b>22</b>. Although first fiber mat <b>12</b> and second fiber mat <b>18</b> are shown with face stock <b>16</b> and face stock <b>22</b>, it should be appreciated that first fiber mat <b>12</b> and second fiber mat <b>18</b> can also be made only from substantially aligned fibers <b>14</b> and substantially aligned fibers <b>20</b>, respectively. Face stock <b>16</b> and face stock <b>22</b> may be provided to give additional support to substantially aligned fibers <b>14</b> and substantially aligned fibers <b>20</b>, respectively. To form mechanical interlocking between substantially aligned fibers <b>14</b> and substantially aligned fibers <b>20</b>, first fiber mat <b>12</b> is brought into intimate contact with second fiber mat <b>18</b>, as represented by arrow A.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, substantially aligned fibers <b>14</b> of first fiber mat <b>12</b> are mechanically interlocked with substantially aligned fibers <b>20</b> of second fiber mat <b>18</b>. The mechanical interlock occurs at a mechanical interlock region, generally indicated by the numeral <b>24</b>. It should be appreciated that <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is not fully representative of mechanical interlocking as defined herein, because it does not show the fibers interlocked with a void space. It should be appreciated that <figref>FIG. 4</figref> and <figref>FIG. 9</figref> show schematic representations of mechanical interlock as defined herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> and <figref>FIG. 3</figref> are representative of one or more embodiments where a first plurality of fibers and a second plurality of fibers are brought together by mechanical interlocking. <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is representative of one or more embodiments where a plurality of fibers has a first end region and a second end region, where the first end region and second end region are mechanically interlocked. For <figref>FIGS. 2-4</figref>, it can be said that a first plurality of fiber segments and a second plurality of fiber segments are mechanically interlocked.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, a fiber mat, generally indicated by the numeral <b>26</b>, includes a plurality of substantially aligned fibers <b>28</b>. In one or more embodiments, fiber mat <b>26</b> includes a face stock. In one or more embodiments, fiber mat <b>26</b> is devoid of a face stock. In one or more embodiments, fiber mat <b>26</b> consists only of substantially aligned fibers <b>28</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Fiber mat <b>26</b> includes a first end region, generally indicated by the numeral <b>30</b>, terminating at end <b>32</b>, and a second end region, generally indicated by the numeral <b>34</b>, terminating at end <b>36</b>. Fiber mat <b>26</b> can then be manipulated, such as by wrapping around, to bring first end region <b>30</b> into intimate contact with second end region <b>34</b>. This intimate contact allows the fibers of first end region <b>30</b> to enter the void spaces of second end region <b>34</b>, and the fibers of second end region <b>34</b> to enter the void spaces of first end region <b>30</b>, as to form a mechanical interlock region, generally indicated by the numeral <b>38</b>. Opening, generally indicated by the numeral <b>40</b>, formed by fiber mat <b>26</b> can contain one or more objects.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, a first fiber mat, generally indicated by the numeral <b>12</b>â², includes a plurality of substantially aligned fibers <b>14</b>â² having void spaces <b>15</b> therebetween. A second fiber mat, generally indicated by the numeral <b>18</b>â², includes a plurality of substantially aligned fibers <b>20</b>â² having void spaces <b>17</b> therebetween. To form mechanical interlocking between substantially aligned fibers <b>14</b>â² and substantially aligned fibers <b>20</b>â², first fiber mat <b>12</b>â² is brought into intimate contact with second fiber mat <b>18</b>â², as represented by the arrow provided. Substantially aligned fibers <b>14</b>â² of first fiber mat <b>12</b>â² are mechanically interlocked with substantially aligned fibers <b>20</b>â² of second fiber mat <b>18</b>â² based on substantially aligned fibers <b>14</b>â² entering void spaces <b>17</b> between substantially aligned fibers <b>20</b>â². Similarly, substantially aligned fibers <b>20</b>â² enter void spaces <b>15</b> between substantially aligned fibers <b>14</b>â². The mechanical interlock occurs at a mechanical interlock region, generally indicated by the numeral <b>24</b>â².</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">As used herein, dry adhesive or adhesion can be generally defined as attaching one substance to another substance. As used herein, adhesive or dry adhesive can be generally defined as attaching one substrate to another substrate, or as attaching one plurality of fiber segments or fibers with another plurality of fibers or fiber segments. As suggested herein, adhesion can be achieved by mechanical interlock, which can also be described as mechanical adhesion.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The fibers described herein, which can also be referred to as aligned nanofibers, can be formed by electrospinning a spinnable liquid. Once received by an electrospinning collection surface, the fibers can also be described as an electrospun non-woven or a fiber mat. As will be further described below, viscoelastic properties of the fibers can be adjusted based on the use of various polymers, solvents, and additives. The viscoelasticity of the nanofibers can be finely tuned to enhance the intimate contacts between nanofibers and their derived mechanical interlocks.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">It should be appreciated that the use of the term alignment or substantially aligned is meant to describe the fibers as extending in a common direction. It should be appreciated that the alignment is general in nature and not absolutely perfect alignment as the collection of nanofibers on the collecting surface exhibiting a minute degree of instability. Thus, the alignment of nanofibers can also be referred to as being substantially aligned or generally aligned. Exemplary alignment is shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. Electrospun fibers having general alignment exhibit significant improvement in adhesion strength compared to randomly orientated fiber mats, particularly those mats having a high degree of porosity. The porosity of a fiber mat provided herein is substantially reduced at least due to the alignment of the fibers.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In one or more embodiments of the present invention, specific electrospinning apparatuses are used to encourage the formation of non-woven fabrics having aligned nanofibers. The nanofibers can be aligned using a rotating mandrel or a parallel electrodes collector. The rotating collector is typically cylindrically shaped, although any shapes known in the art can be utilized. The rotating mandrel can be a drum or a disc. The collected fibers tend to be drawn, stretched, and aligned in the direction of rotation. In one or more embodiments, a more helical winding of the nanofibers is achieved to create a non-woven with aligned fibers in a helical arrangement. It can be said that the nanofibers are aligned to be substantially parallel with other nanofibers. The collected fibers are understood as being aligned as opposed to randomly collected.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The alignment of the fibers can be induced by a rotating drum where the degree of fiber alignment improves with the rotational speed. Randomly oriented fibers are obtained on the drum at take-up velocity (TUV) lower than the fiber TUV. At higher TUV, the fibers extend before being collected on the drum due to a centrifugal force which is developed on the surface of the rotating drum.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Electrospinning is preferably employed to create non-woven fabrics of nanofibers that can serve as dry adhesives. Electrospinning processes are generally well known by those skilled in the art. It is preferred that syringe-less or nozzle-less electrospinning processes are used to form dry adhesives of the present invention. One or more aspects of an electrospinning process may be disclosed by U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,585,437; 8,157,554; 8,231,822; and 8,573,959, which are incorporated herein by reference. One or more aspects of an electrospinning process may be disclosed by PCT Publication No. WO 2014/025793, which is incorporated herein by reference, although certain embodiments of WO 2014/025793 disclose the use of a syringe or spinning nozzle, which is not preferred in the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">A syringe-less or nozzle-less electrospinning process can generally include a container for a polymer solution having at least one polymer solution inlet and at least one polymer solution outlet. The at least one polymer solution inlet and outlet serve to provide circulation of the polymer solution and to maintain the constant height of its level in the container. An air supply can be provided to supply air to the space between a charged electrode and a counter electrode.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The charged electrode is partially immersed in the polymer solution. By rotating the charged electrode, the part of its circumference that is immersed in the polymer solution draws the polymer solution from the container into the space between the charged electrode and the counter electrode, where an electric field is formed. The nanofibers then form on the surface of the counter electrode support material. The formed nanofibers are attracted to the counter electrode based on the effects of the electric field, and consequently they are deposited on the surface of the counter electrode support material, such as a roller. The surface of the counter electrode support material can include a collection material thereon, such as a face stock, for receiving the nanofibers. The thickness of the layer of nanofibers can be controlled by maintaining the counter electrode support material in a collecting position for a predetermined time period. The thickness of the layer of nanofibers can also be controlled using the velocity of an associated reeling device and unreeling device.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, an electrospinning apparatus for creating non-woven fabrics with aligned nanofibers is shown and designated by the numeral <b>50</b>. Apparatus <b>50</b> includes a container <b>52</b> holding a spinnable solution <b>54</b> for electrospinning. A roller <b>56</b> comprises a charged electrode and is partially immersed in spinnable solution <b>54</b>. Roller <b>56</b> can include a multitude of protrusions (not shown), which can become coated with spinnable solution <b>54</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">A second roller <b>58</b> comprises a counter electrode and is positioned proximate to roller <b>56</b>. Second roller <b>58</b> provides a peripheral collecting surface <b>60</b> that can have a face stock positioned therearound. Second roller <b>58</b> can be provided as a drum collector, where the designation as a drum collector typically relates to the collector having a collecting surface that is of a more substantial axial length, whereas designation as a disc collector typically relates to the collector having a very narrow collecting surface, i.e., a more sharp edge.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Roller <b>56</b> comprising the charged electrode is allowed to rotate, as indicated by the provided arrow, such that the portion of its circumference that is immersed in spinnable solution <b>54</b> is able to draw spinnable solution <b>54</b> from container <b>52</b>. Upon rotation of roller <b>56</b>, spinnable solution <b>54</b> is drawn into a space between the charged electrode and the counter electrode, that is, between roller <b>56</b> and second roller <b>58</b>, where an electric field is formed. The formed nanofibers are attracted to the counter electrode based on the effects of the electric field, and consequently they are deposited on surface <b>60</b> of second roller <b>58</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Second roller <b>58</b> is also rotatable, as indicated by the provided arrow, as to allow multiple layers of nanofibers to be collected thereon. Surface <b>60</b> of second roller <b>58</b> can include a collection material thereon, such as a face stock, for receiving the nanofibers. The thickness of the layer of nanofibers can be controlled by allowing the electrospinning to occur for a predetermined time period or for a predetermined amount of rotations of second roller <b>58</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Roller <b>56</b> and second roller <b>58</b> can rotate either in the same direction or in opposite directions. Fiber alignment can be improved if roller <b>56</b> and second roller <b>58</b> rotate in the same direction.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Roller <b>56</b> and second roller <b>58</b> can be rotated by any known methods in the art, such as by attachment to a motor.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Based on the above, it should be appreciated that the apparatus in <figref>FIG. 5</figref> operates as a generally batch process.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, an electrospinning apparatus for creating non-woven fabrics with aligned nanofibers is shown and designated by the numeral <b>70</b>. Apparatus <b>70</b> includes a container <b>72</b> holding a spinnable solution <b>74</b> for electrospinning. An internal roller <b>76</b> comprises a charged electrode and is partially immersed in a spinnable solution <b>74</b>. Internal roller <b>76</b> can include a multitude of protrusions (not shown), which can become coated with spinnable solution <b>74</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Apparatus <b>70</b> includes a plurality of external rollers <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>81</b>, each comprising a counter electrode. External rollers <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are coupled as by way of wheel <b>82</b>. Wheel <b>82</b> is rotatable, as indicated by the provided arrow, as to move external rollers <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> to various positions. Wheel <b>82</b> may also be described as wheel-type frame <b>82</b>. External rollers <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> may be positioned equidistant with each other. That is, external roller <b>78</b> may be positioned equidistant from external roller <b>80</b> and external roller <b>81</b>. Where four external rollers are utilized, the four external rollers may be positioned equidistant from each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">An external roller in the position of external roller <b>78</b> receives a face stock <b>84</b> from a roll <b>86</b>. Roll <b>86</b> can rotate to dispense face stock <b>84</b> and external roller <b>78</b> can rotate to receive face stock <b>84</b>. It can be said that roll <b>86</b> conveys face stock <b>84</b> to external roller <b>78</b>. Once roller <b>78</b> has received sufficient face stock <b>84</b>, cutting device <b>88</b> can cut the face stock <b>84</b>. Cutting device <b>88</b> can be any known device for cutting or severing a face stock.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">After roller <b>78</b> receives a predetermined amount of face stock <b>84</b>, it is allowed to rotate to the position of external roller <b>81</b>. Once in that position, internal roller <b>76</b> is allowed to rotate, such that the portion of its circumference that is immersed in polymer solution <b>74</b> is able to draw polymer solution <b>74</b> from container <b>72</b>. Upon rotation of roller <b>76</b>, polymer solution <b>74</b> is drawn into a space between the charged electrode and the counter electrode, that is, between roller <b>76</b> and external roller <b>81</b>, where an electric field is formed. The formed nanofibers are attracted to the counter electrode based on the effects of the electric field, and consequently they are deposited on the surface of the roller positioned as at external roller <b>81</b>. External roller <b>81</b> is also rotatable as to allow multiple layers of nanofibers to be collected thereon. The surface of external roller <b>81</b> includes face stock <b>84</b> as a collection material for receiving the nanofibers. The thickness of the layer of nanofibers can be controlled by allowing the electrospinning to occur for a predetermined time period or for a predetermined amount of rotations of external roller <b>81</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">External rollers <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, and <b>81</b> can rotate either in the direction of the rotation of internal roller <b>76</b> or in the opposite direction of the rotation of internal roller <b>76</b>. As suggested above, fiber alignment can be improved if external rollers <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, and <b>81</b> rotate in the same direction as internal roller <b>76</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Once electrospinning has been allowed to occur for a predetermined time period, external roller <b>81</b> is allowed to rotate to the position of external roller <b>80</b>.

These properties include fiber diameter (d) and fiber surface roughness. The properties of a non-woven that is formed from the nanofibers can also be controlled in order to tailor the adhesion strength. These properties include bending stiffness (b), non-woven thickness (T), loading angle, and molecular orientation. The properties of both the fibers and the fiber mats can have an effect on the adhesion strength and friction coefficient (Î¼) of the fiber mats.</p>

      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">A fiber mat of the present invention generally has higher shear adhesion while also having generally lower normal adhesion strength. Shear adhesion is the adhesion strength measured in a direction that is coplanar with a cross section of the material, in other words, the adhesion strength measured in a direction that is generally parallel to the surface of the material. Normal adhesion strength, or normal lifting force, is the adhesion strength measured in a direction that is generally perpendicular with the surface of the material. A large difference between shear adhesion and normal adhesion is desired in order to easily switch between attachment of the adhesive and detachment. This property of the fiber mat allows the fiber mat to be removable, repositionable, and reusable.

      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">A fiber mat or dry adhesive as provided herein can be characterized by the degree of alignment of the fibers using 2-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D FFT) analysis of SEM images. 2D FFT provides a reliable and straightforward way to measure fiber alignment in electrospun fibers. 2D FFT has been used widely accepted as a standard method for evaluating alignment. A FFT frequency distribution constructs a plot of normalized intensity versus alignment angle. It can be said that an FFT analysis of a data image containing randomly aligned fibers generates an output image containing pixels distributed in a symmetrical, circular shape. This distribution occurs because the frequency at which specific pixel intensities occur in the data image is theoretically identical in any direction. In contrast, the FFT analysis of a data image containing aligned fibers results in an output image containing pixels distributed in a non-random, elliptical distribution. This distribution occurs because the pixel intensities are preferentially distributed with a specific orientation. Further information regarding FFT analysis is disclosed in the reference article âModulation of anisotropy in electrospun tissue-engineering scaffolds: Analysis of fiber alignment by the fast Fourier transformâ by Ayres et al. from Biomaterials Nov. 2006 (Online Jul. 21, 2006), which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>

The glass transition temperature can be described as the reversible transition in amorphous materials from a hard and relatively brittle state into a molten or rubber-like state. It can also be said that materials having a lower glass transition temperature are generally more âwet.â Generally, forming a fiber mat from a polymeric material that is less âwetâ will give the fiber mat improved reusability properties. Generally, forming a fiber mat from a polymeric material that is more âwetâ will give the fiber mat improved intimate contacts due to flow.

The void space can also be referred to as mating space, as the fiber segments or fibers are matingly received in the mating space and held together. It can also be said that the fiber segments or fibers are mutually complementary with the void space. For example, a first plurality of fibers can include void spaces between the fibers. To form a mechanical interlock, at least a portion of a second plurality of fibers is allowed to enter the void spaces between the fibers of the first plurality of fibers. A general schematic of mechanical interlocking is provided in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, although it should be appreciated that in the nanofiber scale, the first plurality of fiber segments or fibers is in immediate proximity with the second plurality of fiber segments or fibers upon becoming mechanically interlocked.</p>

A second fiber mat, generally indicated by the numeral <b>18</b>â³, includes a plurality of substantially aligned fibers <b>20</b>â³ having void spaces <b>17</b>â³ therebetween. To form mechanical interlocking between substantially aligned fibers <b>14</b>â³ and substantially aligned fibers <b>20</b>â³, first fiber mat <b>12</b>â³ is brought into intimate contact with second fiber mat <b>18</b>â³. Substantially aligned fibers <b>14</b>â³ of first fiber mat <b>12</b>â³ are mechanically interlocked with substantially aligned fibers <b>20</b>â³ of second fiber mat <b>18</b>â³ based on substantially aligned fibers <b>14</b>â³ entering void spaces <b>17</b>â³ between substantially aligned fibers <b>20</b>â³. Similarly, substantially aligned fibers <b>20</b>â³ enter void spaces <b>15</b>â³ between substantially aligned fibers <b>14</b>â³. The mechanical interlock occurs at a mechanical interlock region, generally indicated by the numeral <b>24</b>â³.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0115">Where one or more face stocks are described herein, suitable face stocks can include metal substrates, aluminum foil, polymer films, polyethylene terephthalate films, woven polyester fibers, paper materials, laminates, and carbon fibers. In one or more embodiments, a dry adhesive includes a release liner. In one or more embodiments, a desired face stock is chosen based on the polymer that is used to make the nanofibers.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0116">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, an applicator for applying a dry adhesive is shown and generally designated by the numeral <b>120</b>. Applicator <b>120</b> includes a handle <b>122</b> with a main arm <b>124</b> extending therefrom. Main arm <b>124</b> terminates at an end, where two holder arms <b>126</b> extend therefrom in a horseshoe-type shape. A distal end of each holder arm <b>126</b> is coupled to an internal roller <b>128</b> that carries a fiber mat roll <b>130</b> therearound.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0117">An applicator arm <b>132</b> extends from a middle portion of main arm <b>124</b>. A distal end of applicator arm <b>132</b> carries an applicator, generally indicated by the numeral <b>134</b>. Applicator <b>134</b> comprises an applicator roll <b>136</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0118">Fiber mat roll <b>130</b> comprises a length of fiber mat rolled on itself as to form a cylinder having a central hole therethrough. The central hole receives roller <b>128</b> as to position fiber mat roll <b>130</b> in applicator <b>120</b>. Fiber mat roll <b>130</b> has a fiber mat application portion <b>138</b> extending therefrom and to applicator <b>134</b>. Fiber mat application portion <b>138</b> extends underneath applicator roll <b>136</b> in order to be applied to the surface of a substrate. Advantageously, applicator roll <b>136</b> can be used to press fiber mat application portion <b>138</b> against the surface of a substrate, where the fiber mat application portion <b>138</b> will stick for reasons described herein and in PCT Publication No. WO 2014/025793, which is incorporated herein by reference. Applicator roll <b>136</b> can also be said to be used for removing air from the fiber mat application portion <b>138</b> upon being applied to the surface of a substrate. In one or more embodiments, fiber mat roll <b>130</b> comprises a release substrate (not shown) that is peeled from fiber mat application portion <b>138</b> before applying fiber mat application portion <b>138</b> to the surface of a substrate. Once all of a fiber mat roll <b>130</b> has been applied, a new fiber mat roll <b>130</b> can be supplied to applicator <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0119">Another exemplary applicator is a laminating knife as known by those skilled in the art. As suggested above, a function of an applicator is to rub out air trapped in between nanofibers, enhancing the intimate contacts between the mating faces. This is an improvement over randomly orientated fiber mats, where it is difficult or not possible to remove the air. The trapped air can then cause cracks and delamination of the adhesive from the adherend. In one or more embodiments, a dry adhesive can be said to be airtight.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0120">A dry adhesive formed as described herein may be useful in household applications, biomedical applications, aerospace applications, microelectronic fabrication, wafer fabrication, coatings, advertising, films or labels, robotics applications, textiles and apparels, automotive applications, and as adhesives. A dry adhesive may be used as a high temperature adhesive, where polymers capable of withstanding high temperature are utilized.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">Based on the mechanism of the mechanical interlock described herein, a dry adhesive as described herein can be used underwater and in aqueous environments. The mechanical interlock remains secured even in these environments.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">A method of securing a first substrate with a second substrate can include first steps of providing a first substrate having a plurality of substantially aligned fiber segments having void spaces therebetween and providing a second substrate having a plurality of substantially aligned fiber segments having void spaces therebetween. The pluralities of substantially aligned fiber segments can de directly applied to the first substrate and the second substrate. The substantially aligned fiber segments of the first substrate are allowed to become intimately positioned with the void spaces of the second substrate. The substantially aligned fiber segments of the second substrate are allowed to become intimately positioned with the void spaces of the first substrate. This forms a mechanical interlock utilizing the fiber segments of the first substrate and the fiber segments of the second substrate. The air can be removed, as by pressing or rolling out the air, as to further secure the mechanical interlock.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">In light of the foregoing, it should be appreciated that the present invention significantly advances the art by providing improved dry adhesives and associated methods of manufacture and use. While particular embodiments of the invention have been disclosed in detail herein, it should be appreciated that the invention is not limited thereto or thereby inasmuch as variations on the invention herein will be readily appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.
