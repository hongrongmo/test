      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The disclosure relates generally to medical devices. More particularly, the disclosure relates to catheters useful in delivering a medication to a bodily passage, such as a sinus cavity. The disclosure also relates to delivery systems, methods and kits.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">It is sometimes necessary or otherwise desirable to deliver a medication to a bodily passage, such as a sinus cavity. For example, when sinus cavities become infected or inflamed, delivering a medication to the affected area provides an approach to address the infection or inflammation. Conventional procedures include performing nasal rinses and using nebulizers to deliver a medication, such as therapeutic agents, into the nasal passages with hopes that some therapeutic agent will reach the infected or inflamed sinus cavity. These approaches, however, are minimally effective at delivering the medication to the sinus cavity because they rely on indirect delivery of the medication to the cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">While some methods of treatment achieve direct delivery of the medication to the cavity, these methods also have disadvantages. For example, a tube with an anchoring member at its distal end can be placed into the cavity to provide access for delivery. These devices and techniques, however, lack sufficient structure to achieve a uniform distribution of the medication throughout the cavity and placement of the tube must be done without the aid of a delivery system, which increases the complexity and time required to position the tube in the cavity. Also, the anchoring member occludes the sinus opening through which the tube has been deployed, which can block the natural outflow of material from the cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">A further alternative method of treatment involves the systemic administration of oral antibiotics and/or steroids. This approach, however, can have limited effectiveness and may lead to systemic consequences. For example, long-term use of corticosteroids has been associated with spasms of the large airways, fungus infection, decreased bone thickness, and/or growth impediments.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Therefore, a need exists for improved medical devices, methods and kits for delivering a medication to a bodily passage, such as a sinus cavity.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Various exemplary medical devices, catheters, delivery systems, and methods are described.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">An exemplary medical device for treating a sinus cavity comprises a delivery system and a catheter. The delivery system comprises a housing, a cannula, and a pusher. The housing has a housing proximal end, a housing distal end, and defines a first housing opening, a second housing opening, and a housing lumen. The housing lumen extends between the first housing opening and the second housing opening. The cannula has a cannula proximal end, a cannula distal end, and defines a first cannula opening, a second cannula opening, and a cannula lumen. The cannula lumen extends between the first cannula opening and the second cannula opening. The cannula is attached to the housing such that the housing lumen and the cannula lumen are in communication. The pusher has a pusher proximal end and a pusher distal end that is slidably disposed in the cannula lumen. The catheter has at least a portion disposed in the cannula lumen and has a catheter proximal end, a catheter distal end, and a catheter length that extends between the catheter proximal end and the catheter distal end. The catheter defines a first catheter opening, a second catheter opening, a bend, a coil, and a catheter lumen that extends between the first catheter opening and the second catheter opening. The pusher distal end is adapted to engage with the catheter proximal end to transfer axial movement to the catheter. The catheter is adapted to move between a first configuration in which the portion of the catheter that is disposed within the cannula lumen is substantially straight when disposed in the cannula lumen and a second configuration in which the catheter defines the bend and the coil along the catheter length when the catheter is free of the cannula lumen.</p>

The catheter has at least a portion disposed in the cannula lumen and has a catheter wall, a catheter proximal end, a catheter distal end, and a catheter length that extends between the catheter proximal end and the catheter distal end. The catheter defines a first catheter opening, second catheter opening, a plurality of apertures, a bend, a coil, and a catheter lumen. The first catheter opening is disposed on the catheter proximal end. The plurality of apertures is disposed along the catheter length and each aperture of the plurality of apertures extends through the catheter wall and is in communication with the catheter lumen. The coil and the plurality of apertures is disposed distal to the bend and the catheter lumen extends between the first catheter opening and the plurality of apertures. The pusher distal end is adapted to engage with the catheter proximal end to transfer axial movement to the catheter. The catheter is adapted to move between a first configuration in which the portion of the catheter that is disposed within the cannula lumen is substantially straight when disposed in the cannula lumen and a second configuration in which the catheter defines the bend and the coil along the catheter length when the catheter is free of the cannula lumen.</p>

      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a first exemplary catheter <b>10</b> having a catheter proximal end <b>12</b>, a catheter distal end <b>14</b>, and a catheter wall <b>15</b>. Catheter <b>10</b> defines a first catheter opening <b>16</b>, a second catheter opening <b>18</b>, a lumen <b>20</b>, a bend <b>22</b>, a coil <b>24</b>, and a catheter length that extends from the catheter proximal end <b>12</b> to the catheter distal end <b>14</b>. Catheter <b>10</b> is adapted to move between a first configuration in which the catheter is substantially straight (e.g., when the catheter is disposed within a delivery system) and a second configuration in which the catheter defines bend <b>22</b> and coil <b>24</b> (e.g., when the catheter is free of the delivery system). <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates catheter <b>10</b> in the second configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Catheter <b>10</b> can comprise any suitable tubular member having any suitable outside diameter and any suitable inside diameter defining a lumen, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable tubular member according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the desired bodily passage within which the catheter is intended to be used. The inventors have determined that catheters having an outside diameter between about 0.05 inches to about 0.1 inches are suitable. In addition, the inventors have determined that catheters having an outside diameter about, equal to, or substantially equal to 0.077 inches are also suitable. Furthermore, the inventors have determined that catheters having an inside diameter between about 0.025 inches to about 0.075 inches are suitable. Moreover, the inventors have determined that catheters having an inside diameter about, equal to, or substantially equal to 0.050 inches are also suitable.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Catheter <b>10</b> can be formed of any suitable flexible, or substantially flexible, material, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable material for a catheter according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the bodily passage within which the catheter is intended to be used. The material selected for a catheter need only be biocompatible, or able to be made biocompatible, and able to move between a first configuration and a second configuration, as described herein. Also, it is considered advantageous to select a material for a catheter that is relatively soft and/or supple at least because such a material allows for the catheter to be passed through tortuous bodily passages and reduces irritation when the catheter is disposed in a bodily passage. Example materials considered suitable include, but are not limited to, polymers, such as urethane, polyurethane, polyethylene, Pebax (Pebax is a registered trademark of Ato Chimie Corporation of Allee des Vosges, Courbevoie, France), silicone, and nylon.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Catheter <b>10</b> can optionally include a radiopaque marker disposed at catheter proximal end <b>12</b>, catheter distal end <b>14</b>, and/or along any portion, or the entirety, of the catheter length (e.g., at bend <b>22</b>, at coil <b>24</b>), to facilitate tracking and positioning of catheter <b>10</b> during, or subsequent to, deployment. Alternative, or in combination, with providing a radiopaque marker disposed on catheter <b>10</b>, the material forming catheter <b>10</b> can include a radiopaque filler to facilitate tracking and positioning of catheter <b>10</b>. Any suitable radiopaque material can be used, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable radiopaque material according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, such as the desired bodily passage within which a catheter is intended to be deployed. Examples of suitable radiopaque materials include, but are not limited to, cadmium, tungsten, gold, tantalum, bismuth, platinum, iridium, and rhodium. Visualization, tracking, and/or positioning of catheter <b>10</b> can be accomplished using any suitable method, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable method according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, such as the desired bodily passage within which a catheter is intended to be deployed. Example methods considered suitable to facilitate visualization, tracking, and/or positioning of a catheter include, but are not limited to, using x-ray, fluoroscopy, ultrasound, direct visualization with a scope, and magnetic resonance imaging.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The first catheter opening <b>16</b> is defined on the catheter proximal end <b>12</b> and the second catheter opening <b>18</b> is defined on the catheter distal end <b>14</b>. Each of the first catheter opening <b>16</b> and the second catheter opening <b>18</b> are in communication with lumen <b>20</b> and can have any suitable diameter. While the first catheter opening <b>16</b> and the second catheter opening <b>18</b> have been described and illustrated as defined on the catheter proximal end <b>12</b> and the catheter distal end <b>14</b>, respectively, a first catheter opening and a second catheter opening can be positioned at any suitable location along the catheter length. Skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable position for each of a first catheter opening and a second catheter opening according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the desired bodily passage within which the catheter is intended to be used. For example, either, or both of a first catheter opening and a second catheter opening can be defined along the length of a catheter between the catheter proximal end and the catheter distal end and extend through the wall of a catheter.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Lumen <b>20</b> extends between the first catheter opening <b>16</b> and the second catheter opening <b>18</b>. Lumen <b>20</b> can have any suitable inner diameter along the catheter length, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable inner diameter according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the desired bodily passage within which the catheter is intended to be used. Example inner diameters considered suitable include, but are not limited to, inner diameters that are continuous, or substantially continuous, along the catheter length, and inner diameters that vary along the catheter length.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">When in the second configuration, catheter <b>10</b> defines bend <b>22</b> and coil <b>24</b> along the catheter length. In the illustrated embodiment, bend <b>22</b> defines an angle <b>23</b> greater than 90 degrees between the portion of the catheter <b>10</b> proximal to bend <b>22</b> and the portion of the catheter distal to bend <b>22</b>. A length of catheter <b>10</b> is disposed distal to bend <b>22</b> that defines a distance between the portion of the catheter distal to bend <b>22</b> (e.g., coil <b>24</b>) and the portion of the catheter <b>10</b> proximal to bend <b>22</b> when the catheter <b>10</b> is in the second configuration. This is considered advantageous at least because it allows the catheter <b>10</b> to be positioned such that coil <b>24</b> is disposed within a first bodily passage (e.g., a sinus cavity) and the portion of the catheter proximal to bend <b>22</b> is disposed within a second, different, bodily passage (e.g., a nasal passage).</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">While catheter <b>10</b> has been described and illustrated as defining a bend <b>22</b> at a particular angle, any suitable angle can be defined by a catheter, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable angle for a bend according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the desired bodily passage within which the catheter is intended to be used. The inventors have determined that angles between about 1 degree to about 180 degrees are suitable. Also, the inventors have determined that angles between about 10 degrees and about 170 degrees are suitable. In addition, the inventors have determined that angles between about 45 degrees and about 135 degrees are suitable. Furthermore, the inventors have determined that an angle of about, equal to, or substantially equal to 90 degrees is also suitable. Moreover, the inventors have determined that an angle of about, equal to, or substantially equal to 150 degrees is also suitable.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In addition, while catheter <b>10</b> has been described and illustrated as defining a distance between the portion of the catheter distal to bend <b>22</b> (e.g., coil <b>24</b>) and the portion of the catheter <b>10</b> proximal to bend <b>22</b> when the catheter <b>10</b> is in the second configuration, other structural arrangements are considered suitable. Skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable structural arrangement for a catheter according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the desired bodily passage within which a catheter is intended to be deployed. For example, alternative to defining a distance between a portion of the catheter distal to bend and a portion of the catheter proximal to bend when the catheter is in the second configuration, the catheter can omit the inclusion of a length of catheter distal to the bend such that the portion of the catheter distal to the bend (e.g., coil <b>24</b>) overlaps, or extends over, the portion of the catheter proximal to the bend.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Catheter <b>10</b> defines coil <b>24</b> distal to bend <b>22</b>. Coil <b>24</b> advantageously provides a structure for maintaining the position of the catheter <b>10</b> within a bodily passage upon deployment, as described in more detail herein. When the catheter <b>10</b> is in the second configuration, coil <b>24</b> is free of the portion of catheter <b>10</b> disposed proximal to bend <b>22</b> such that it does not wrap around the portion of catheter <b>10</b> disposed proximal to bend <b>22</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Alternatively, or in combination with the other structural details described herein (e.g., bend, coil), a catheter can include additional structure that is capable, or adapted to, maintain the catheter within a bodily passage. Example structures considered suitable to include on a catheter include, but are not limited to, malecot structures, cuffs, one or more balloons, and any other structure considered suitable for a particular application. The additional structure can be positioned on the catheter at any suitable location, proximal to a bend, distal to a bend, at a bend, at a coil, in place of a coil, in place of a bend, between the proximal and distal end, and any other location considered suitable for a particular application. For example, if a balloon is used to maintain the position of a catheter within a bodily passage, the catheter can define a second lumen that is in communication with a chamber defined by the balloon such that fluid can be introduced into the balloon chamber to inflate the balloon.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Coil <b>24</b> can comprise any suitable length, define any suitable outside diameter, define any suitable number of coils, and extend in any suitable arrangement, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable length, outside diameter, number of coils, and arrangement for a coil according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the desired bodily passage within which the catheter is intended to be used. The inventors have determined that catheters defining a coil having an outside diameter between about 0.35 inches to about 0.85 inches are suitable. In addition, the inventors have determined that catheters defining a coil having an outside diameter about, equal to, or substantially equal to 0.59 inches are also suitable. It is considered advantageous for a catheter to define a single coil at least because this increases the manufacturability of the catheter. In addition, a catheter that defines multiple coils requires a greater catheter length and a longer delivery system than a catheter that defines a single coil.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In use, catheter <b>10</b> provides a mechanism for introducing a medication, or other material or fluid, into a bodily passage (e.g., sinus cavity). For example, subsequent to deployment, a syringe, or other structure, can be attached to the catheter proximal end <b>12</b> and used to introduce a medication or fluid through first catheter opening <b>16</b>, the catheter lumen <b>20</b>, and the second catheter opening <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Cather <b>10</b> can be formed using any suitable technique to achieve a desired structural arrangement (e.g., bend <b>22</b>, coil <b>24</b>), and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable technique to form a catheter according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the bodily passage within which the device is intended to be used. An example technique considered suitable to form a catheter includes, but is not limited to, using heat to import memory into the catheter. For example, a forming plate can be used to force the catheter into a desired shape. This can be accomplished by placing a material into the catheter lumen to prevent its collapse during formation, placing the catheter in the forming plate, and then heating the catheter to a suitable temperature. Subsequently, the catheter is cooled to room temperature and removed from the forming plate. Any suitable temperature can be used to form a catheter, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable temperature according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, such as the material that forms the catheter. For example, the inventors have determined that when a catheter is formed of urethane, suitable temperatures to achieve a desired structural arrangement include temperatures between about 108 degrees Celsius to about 158 degrees Celsius. In addition, the inventors have determined that when a catheter is formed of urethane, a suitable temperature to achieve a desired structural arrangement includes a temperature about, equal to, or substantially equal to 133 degrees Celsius.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a second exemplary catheter <b>110</b>. The catheter <b>110</b> is similar to catheter <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, and described above, except as detailed below. Reference numbers in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> refer to the same structural element or feature referenced by the same number in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, offset by 100. Thus, catheter <b>110</b> has a catheter proximal end <b>112</b>, a catheter distal end <b>114</b>, and defines a first catheter opening <b>116</b>, a second catheter opening <b>118</b>, and a lumen <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">In the illustrated embodiment, catheter <b>110</b> defines a flared catheter proximal end <b>112</b> and flared lumen <b>120</b> at the catheter proximal end <b>112</b>, a tapered catheter distal end <b>114</b>, a bend <b>122</b>, a first coil <b>124</b>, a second coil <b>126</b>, and a plurality of apertures <b>128</b>. In addition, catheter <b>110</b> includes a marker <b>130</b> disposed at bend <b>122</b>. Catheter <b>110</b> is adapted to move between a first configuration in which the catheter <b>110</b> is substantially straight (e.g., when the catheter is disposed within a delivery system) and a second configuration in which the catheter <b>110</b> defines bend <b>122</b>, first coil <b>124</b>, and second coil <b>126</b> (e.g., when the catheter is free of the delivery system). <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates catheter <b>110</b> in the second configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Including a flared catheter proximal end <b>112</b> and flared lumen <b>120</b> at the catheter proximal end <b>112</b> is considered advantageous at least because it provides a structural arrangement that allows for the introduction of another device (e.g., syringe, adaptor) into the first catheter opening <b>116</b> to pass a medication or fluid through lumen <b>120</b> and the plurality of apertures <b>128</b>. Including a tapered catheter distal end <b>114</b> is considered advantageous at least because it provides a structural arrangement that allows for the dilation of an opening of a bodily passage during deployment of the catheter <b>110</b>, ease of insertion atraumatically, and/or reduces the likelihood of the catheter distal end <b>114</b> from catching on a structure. For example, when the catheter <b>110</b> is advanced over a previously placed wire guide and into a bodily passage, providing a tapered catheter distal end <b>114</b> provides a mechanism for dilating the bodily passage and advancing past structures during deployment. Optionally, in instances where a catheter has been formed of a soft material (e.g., urethane), a stiffer material can be bonded to the softer material along a portion, or the entirety, of the catheter length to assist with dilation and positioning of the catheter within a bodily passage.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In the illustrated embodiment, catheter <b>110</b> defines bend <b>122</b> at an angle <b>123</b> equal to, substantially equal to, or about 90 degrees. It is considered advantageous for catheter <b>110</b> to define bend <b>122</b> at an angle equal to, substantially equal to, or about 90 degrees at least to provide a structural arrangement that allows catheter <b>110</b> to be held in place upon deployment. For example, when a portion, or the entirety, of catheter <b>110</b> is deployed in a sinus passage and/or sinus cavity, defining bend <b>122</b> at an angle equal to, substantially equal to, or about 90 degrees allows for a portion, or the entirety, of the catheter proximal to bend <b>122</b> to extend through the sinus passage and out of the nostril and a portion, or the entirety, of the catheter distal to bend <b>122</b> to be disposed within the sinus passage and/or sinus cavity, while preventing obstruction of the sinus passage and irritation.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">While bend <b>122</b> has been illustrated as defining a curve along the length of catheter <b>110</b>, a bend can define any suitable structure and/or feature along the length of a catheter, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable structure and/or feature to include in a catheter according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the desired bodily passage within which the catheter is to be deployed. Example structures and/or features considered suitable to include on a catheter include, but are not limited to, defining a corner at a right angle at a bend in the catheter, defining a curve at a right angle at a bend in the catheter, defining a corner at any suitable angle at a bend in the catheter, defining a curve at any suitable angle at a bend in the catheter, defining a hard corner at a right angle at a bend in the catheter such that at least one point is defined along the catheter length at the corner, and defining a hard corner at any suitable angle at a bend in the catheter such that at least one point is defined along the catheter length at the corner.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Catheter <b>110</b> defines the first coil <b>124</b> distal to bend <b>122</b>. First coil <b>124</b> advantageously provides a structural arrangement for maintaining the position of the catheter <b>110</b> within a bodily passage upon deployment, as described herein. When the catheter <b>110</b> is in the second configuration, first coil <b>124</b> is free of the portion of catheter <b>110</b> disposed proximal to bend <b>122</b> such that it does not wrap around the portion of catheter <b>110</b> disposed proximal to bend <b>122</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The plurality of apertures <b>128</b> is disposed distal to bend <b>122</b>, extend through the wall <b>115</b> of the catheter <b>110</b> and each aperture of the plurality of apertures <b>128</b> is in communication with the catheter lumen <b>120</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the a first set and a second set of the plurality of apertures <b>128</b> are disposed linearly on first coil <b>124</b>. This arrangement is considered advantageous at least because it positions the plurality of apertures <b>128</b> along the first coil <b>124</b> such that a first set of apertures from the plurality of apertures <b>128</b> is disposed on an outwardly facing side <b>121</b> of the first coil <b>124</b> and a second set of apertures from the plurality of apertures <b>128</b> is disposed on an inwardly facing side <b>119</b> of the first coil <b>124</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">While the plurality of apertures <b>128</b> has been described and illustrated as arranged linearly along the first coil <b>124</b>, any suitable arrangement of a plurality of apertures is considered suitable, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable arrangement for a plurality of apertures according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the desired amount of medication or fluid to be delivered to a bodily passage, such as a sinus cavity. Example arrangements considered suitable to arrange a plurality of apertures, or a set thereof, along a portion, or the entirety, of a catheter and/or coil include, but are not limited to, arranging the apertures circumferentially, linearly, spirally, randomly, regularly, in a grid, and/or staggered.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Also, while a plurality of apertures <b>128</b> has been described and illustrated, any suitable number of apertures can be included in a catheter and each aperture can define any suitable diameter and/or shape. Skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable number of apertures for a catheter and a suitable diameter and/or shape for each aperture according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the treatment intended to be performed. Example numbers of apertures considered suitable include one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten and any number determined suitable for a particular application. Example diameters considered suitable include, but are not limited to, diameters where at least two of the plurality of apertures <b>128</b> vary in diameter (e.g., have different diameters). Further example diameters considered suitable include, but are not limited to, diameters which are about, equal to, less than, greater than, or substantially equal to the inside diameter of the tubular member (e.g., diameter of lumen). Example shapes considered suitable to define an aperture include, but are not limited to, circular, oval, oblong, and any suitable polygonal shape. For example, when delivery of a medication or fluid at a greater flow rate is desired, a catheter can define an aperture having an oval or oblong shape which is longer on its lengthwise axis than the inside diameter of the catheter.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Catheter <b>110</b> defines the second coil <b>126</b> proximal to bend <b>122</b>. Second coil <b>124</b> is adapted to move between a first straight, or substantially straight, configuration and a second coiled configuration. <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the second coil <b>126</b> in the second coiled configuration. The second coil <b>126</b> advantageously provides a structural arrangement for maintaining a length of catheter <b>110</b> proximal to bend <b>122</b> within a bodily passage when catheter <b>110</b> is in its second configuration. For example, when the first coil <b>124</b> has been deployed in a sinus cavity and the second coil <b>126</b> has been positioned in a nasal passage, a user can place a proximal force on the catheter proximal end <b>112</b> to move the second coil <b>126</b> from its second coiled configuration to its first straight, or substantially straight, configuration such that the catheter proximal end <b>112</b> extends out of the nostril. This advantageously allows for a user to extend the catheter <b>110</b> out of the nostril to pass a medication or fluid through the lumen <b>120</b> of the catheter <b>110</b>, while allowing the second coil <b>126</b> to move back to its second coiled configuration and into the nasal passage upon the release of the proximal force on the catheter <b>110</b>.</p>

Marker <b>130</b> can be formed in any suitable manner. For example, marker <b>130</b> can be embedded within, or disposed on the inner diameter of catheter lumen <b>120</b>, and/or on the exterior surface of catheter <b>110</b>. It is considered advantageous to include marker <b>130</b> at least to assist a user in accurately placing the catheter <b>110</b> within a bodily passage. Also, marker <b>130</b> advantageously indicates the location of bend <b>122</b> during deployment of catheter <b>110</b> and provides an indication as to when coil <b>124</b> has been deployed. While a single marker <b>130</b> has been illustrated and described, a catheter can have any suitable number of markers, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable number of markers according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, such as the desired bodily passage within which the catheter is intended to be deployed.

      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Alternative to, or in combination with, using a marker <b>130</b>, a catheter can comprise a first portion having a first color (e.g., red) and a second portion having a second color (e.g., blue) that is different than the first color. The first portion having a first color and a second portion having a second color can be disposed at any suitable location along the length of a catheter. Example locations considered suitable include, but are not limited to, positioning a first portion having a first color along a portion, or the entirety, of the length of a catheter disposed proximal to a bend or coil and positioning a second portion having a second color along a portion, or the entirety, of the length of the catheter disposed distal to a bend or coil. Any suitable number of portions of a catheter can have any suitable color to assist with placement of a catheter within a bodily passage. A color can be disposed on a surface of the catheter (e.g., painted) or comprise part of the material forming a catheter.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Alternative to including a single marker, a catheter can include more than one marker or an elongated marker that extends along a portion, or the entirety, of the length of catheter disposed proximal to a bend or coil. For example, a first marker can be positioned at a bend or coil and a second marker can be positioned proximal to the first marker (e.g., on catheter proximal end, between catheter proximal end and a bend or coil) or an elongated marker can be positioned between a catheter proximal end and a bend or coil, or from a bend or coil to the catheter proximal end or a location between the bend or coil and the catheter proximal end. Inclusion of an elongated marker or more than one marker is considered advantageous at least because it provides a mechanism for indicating placement of the catheter relative to a particular portion of a bodily passage (e.g., frontal recess, marker can be disposed adjacent to the frontal recess and/or a coil can be positioned in a frontal sinus).</p>

Thus, the delivery system <b>332</b> has a housing <b>334</b>, cannula <b>336</b>, and a pusher <b>338</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">In the illustrated embodiment, housing <b>334</b> defines a slot <b>372</b>, protuberances <b>374</b>, finger flanges <b>376</b>, and grooves <b>378</b>. Pusher <b>338</b> defines a raised track <b>382</b>, protuberances <b>384</b>, and finger flange <b>386</b>. In addition, cannula <b>336</b> defines a bend <b>380</b> along the cannula length.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">Slot <b>372</b> is elongated and extends from the housing proximal end <b>340</b> towards the housing distal end <b>342</b> and through the wall <b>343</b> of the housing <b>334</b>. Slot <b>372</b> provides access to housing lumen <b>348</b>. Slot <b>372</b> can comprise any suitable length and width that allows raised track <b>382</b> to be slidably disposed within slot <b>372</b>, as described below. Skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable structural arrangement for a slot according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the structural arrangement of a pusher intended to be used with the housing.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">Each of the protuberances <b>374</b> extends into slot <b>372</b> and tapers from the distal end of the protuberance to the proximal end of the protuberance. Protuberances <b>374</b> can have any suitable length and define any suitable taper such that protuberances <b>384</b> can pass through the length of housing <b>334</b> that defines protuberances <b>374</b> in at least the distal direction. Skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable structural arrangement for the protuberances of a housing according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the structural arrangement of a pusher intended to be used with the housing.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">Each of the finger flanges <b>376</b> extends radially outward from housing <b>334</b> and defines a curve along its length. Finger flanges <b>376</b> advantageously provide structure for a user to grasp delivery system <b>332</b> and initiate axial movement between housing <b>334</b> and pusher <b>338</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">Each of the grooves <b>378</b> defines a depression that extends into the wall <b>343</b> of housing <b>334</b> and provides a mechanism for a user to place the delivery system <b>332</b> between one or more fingers such that rotation of the delivery system <b>332</b> can be achieved. While particular structural arrangements have been described and illustrated for finger flanges <b>376</b> and grooves <b>378</b>, other structural arrangements are considered suitable. Skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable structural arrangement for a finger flange and a groove according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the structural arrangement of a pusher intended to be used with the housing. Optionally, finger flanges <b>376</b> and/or grooves <b>378</b> can be omitted from delivery system <b>332</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">In the illustrated embodiment, cannula <b>336</b> has a cannula length that extends from the cannula proximal end <b>350</b> to the cannula distal end <b>352</b> and defines a bend <b>380</b> along the cannula length. Bend <b>380</b> can be disposed at any suitable angle <b>381</b> on cannula <b>336</b> and can be formed at any suitable location along the cannula length. Skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable angle and location for a bend according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the bodily passage within which a catheter is to be deployed. The inventors have determined that angles between about 1 degree to about 180 degrees are suitable. In addition, the inventors have determined that angles between about 110 degrees to about 170 degrees are suitable. Furthermore, the inventors have determined that an angle of about, equal to, or substantially equal to 150 degrees is also suitable.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">In addition, while a cannula defining a single bend has been illustrated and described, a cannula of a delivery system can define any suitable number of bends along the cannula length, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable number of bends for a cannula according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, such as the bodily passage within which a catheter is intended to be deployed. Example numbers of bends considered suitable for a cannula include, but are not limited to, one, two, three, four and any other number considered suitable for a particular application. For example, a cannula can define a proximal bend and a distal bend along the cannula length and the bends can be defined at angles that are equal to, substantially equal to, or different from one another (e.g., a distal bend that is less than a proximal bend, a distal bend that is greater than a proximal bend).</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">In the illustrated embodiment, the first portion <b>360</b> of pusher <b>338</b> defines a raised track <b>382</b>, protuberances <b>384</b>, and finger flange <b>386</b>. Raised track <b>382</b> extends radially outward from the first portion <b>360</b>, along a portion, or the entirety, of the length of pusher <b>338</b> and defines a structural arrangement that complements slot <b>372</b>. Raised track <b>382</b>, or a portion thereof, is adapted to be slidably disposed within slot <b>372</b> such that pusher <b>338</b> moves axially along the length of housing <b>334</b> when axial force is applied to pusher <b>338</b>. Raised track <b>382</b> can comprise any suitable length and width such that it can be slidably disposed within slot <b>372</b>. Skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable structural arrangement for a raised track according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the structural arrangement of a housing intended to be used with the pusher.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">Protuberances <b>384</b> are defined on the distal end of raised track <b>382</b> and each protuberance extends radially outward from raised track <b>382</b>. Each protuberance <b>384</b> tapers from the proximal end of the protuberance <b>384</b> to the distal end of the protuberance <b>384</b>. Protuberances <b>384</b> can have any suitable length and define any suitable taper such that protuberances <b>384</b> can pass through the length of housing <b>334</b> that defines protuberances <b>374</b> in at least the distal direction.

      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">Raised track <b>382</b> and protuberances <b>384</b> have a structural arrangement that complements slot <b>372</b> and protuberances <b>374</b> such that raised track <b>382</b> and protuberances <b>384</b> can be slidably disposed within slot <b>372</b>. Protuberances <b>384</b> are adapted to pass protuberances <b>374</b> in a distal direction, illustrated by arrow <b>385</b>, such that once protuberances <b>384</b> are positioned distal to protuberances <b>374</b>, the distal end of protuberances <b>374</b> and proximal end of protuberances <b>384</b> interact to limit proximal movement of pusher <b>338</b>. The distal end of slot <b>372</b> limits distal movement of pusher <b>338</b>, illustrated by arrow <b>385</b>. Thus, slot <b>372</b> advantageously provides a track for guiding proximal and distal axial movement of pusher <b>338</b> along the length of housing <b>334</b>. For example, when raised track <b>382</b> is inserted into slot <b>372</b>, the distance between each protuberance <b>374</b> across slot <b>372</b> increases from a first distance to a second, greater, distance to allow protuberances <b>384</b> to pass distally past protuberances <b>374</b>. Once protuberances <b>384</b> have past, and are positioned distal to protuberances <b>374</b>, the distance between each protuberance <b>374</b> across slot <b>372</b> returns to the first distance such that interaction (e.g., interference) between the distal end of protuberances <b>374</b> and proximal end of protuberances <b>384</b> can occur.</p>

Finger flange <b>386</b> advantageously provides a mechanism for advancing pusher <b>338</b> axially in the proximal or distal direction upon the application of force. It is considered advantageous to provide finger flange <b>386</b> along the length of pusher <b>338</b>, between the first proximal end <b>364</b> and the first distal end <b>366</b>, at least to provide additional structure to move pusher <b>338</b> in a proximal and distal direction (e.g., by a user with small hands). While a single finger flange <b>386</b> has been described and illustrated as disposed along the length of raised track <b>382</b>, any suitable number of finger flanges can be positioned at any suitable location along the length of pusher <b>338</b>, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable number of finger flanges and a suitable location to position each finger flange <b>386</b> according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the structural arrangement of a pusher intended to be used with the finger flange.

To accomplish passing an optical fiber through a catheter lumen, any of the pushers described herein can define an optical fiber lumen that extends between an opening at, or near, the proximal end of the pusher and an opening at, or near, the distal end of the pusher. The optical fiber can be introduced and passed through the optical fiber lumen of the pusher and also introduced into and/or passed through the catheter lumen.</p>
