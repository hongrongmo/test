    <heading id="h-00002-en">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">As we age, our lenses undergo physiological changes that make it more difficult to focus on near objects. That is why nearly everyone requires reading glasses, even as early as age 35-40. The ability of the eye to change focal power, also known as accommodative amplitude, decreases significantly with age. The accommodative amplitude is 20 diopters in children and young adults, but it decreases to 10 diopters by age 25 and to ≤ 1 diopter by age 60. The age-related inability to focus on near objects is called presbyopia. All of us will develop presbyopia and will use corrective lenses unless a new treatment is found.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Both presbyopia and cataract are age-related and may share common etiologies such as lens growth, oxidative stress, and/or disulfide bond formation.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">There is a need for compositions and methods for combating presbyopia and/or cataract, particularly compositions and methods that minimize toxicity to surrounding healthy tissues.</p>
    <heading id="h-00003-en">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition for ocular use comprises a lipoic acid-based active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The amount of the active agent can be, e.g., less than about 250 µM, about 5 µM to about 250 µM, or about 10 µM to about 100 µM. The pharmaceutical composition can include, e.g., an emulsifier and a buffered carrier.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The active agent can be, e.g., any one of 5-(1,2-dithiolan-3-yl)pentanoic acid; 5-(1,2-thiaselenolan-5-yl)pentanoic acid; dihydrolipoate; 5-(1,2-thiaselenolan-3-yl)pentanoic acid; 6,8-dimercaptooctanoic acid; or a salt or ester thereof. The active agent can be the R enantiomer.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In another embodiment, a method of preventing or treating oxidation damage to cells comprises administering the pharmaceutical composition either in vivo or in vitro. The cells can be ocular cells, e.g., lens cells. The compound can be administered via a topical ocular, subtenons, subconjunctival, intracameral, intravitreal, or iontophoresis route.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The method can include a step of administering a chemical energy source, e.g., glucose or NADPH, simultaneously or consecutively with the active agent. The method can include a step of applying energy, e.g., to a localized region, to facilitate breaking disulfide bonds.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The method can be used to increase or maintain accommodative amplitude, as measured in diopters, to at least 2% greater than the accommodative amplitude expected in an untreated lens of about the same age. The method can increases accommodative amplitude by at least 0.25 diopters. The method can be used to increase or maintain lens elasticity, as measured in diopters or by elasticity E, to at least 2% greater than the elasticity expected in an untreated lens of about the same age. The method can be used to decrease or maintain lens opacity to at least 2% less than the opacity expected in an untreated lens of about the same age.</p>

    <heading id="h-00005-en">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Compositions and methods are provided that can prevent, reduce, reverse, and/or slow the rate of lens growth, oxidative damage, and/or disulfide bond formation. These compositions and methods may thus effectively prevent or treat presbyopia and/or cataract.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In one embodiment, we provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising an active agent that is lipoic acid, especially alpha lipoic acid, or a derivative thereof. Preferably, the active agent is a reducing agent that is capable of reducing disulfide bonds, particularly disulfide bond formation in lens membranes and membrane associated proteins. Accordingly, particularly preferred active agents are capable of entering into the lens epithelial cells.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In one embodiment, the active agent enters the lens epithelial cells using a naturally occurring transport mechanism. For example, lipoic acid enters lens cells via specific plasma membrane symporters and antiporters. In one embodiment, the active agent is a derivative of lipoic acid that maintains the capability of utilizing the naturally occurring transport mechanism for lipoic acid.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In one embodiment, the active agent is lipoic acid, especially alpha-lipoic acid, or a derivative thereof. Lipoic acid-based active agents include, but are not limited to, 5-(1,2-dithiolan-3-yl)pentanoic acid (lipoic acid); 6,8-dimercaptooctanoic acid (dihydrolipoic acid); and dihydrolipoate.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In another embodiment, the active agent can be a seleno-substituted agent. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that including selenium in the active agent can improve redox potential compared to the same agent without selenium. The selenium derivative can thus take advantage of the intracellular redox potential of the lens. Accordingly, the active agent can be a lipoic acid derivative including selenium. In one embodiment, the active agent is a seleno-lipoic acid-based agent such as 5-(1,2-thiaselenolan-5-yl)pentanoic acid or 5-(1,2-thiaselenolan-3-yl)pentanoic acid.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In one embodiment, the active agent is 5-(1,2-dithiolan-3-yl)pentanoic acid; 6,8-dimercaptooctanoic acid; dihydrolipoate; 5-(1,2-thiaselenolan-5-yl)pentanoic acid; or 5-(1,2-thiaselenolan-3-yl)pentanoic acid. In another embodiment, the active agent is 6,8-dimercaptooctanoic acid; dihydrolipoate; 5-(1,2-thiaselenolan-5-yl)pentanoic acid; or 5-(1,2-thiaselenolan-3-yl)pentanoic acid. In another embodiment, the active agent is 6,8-dimercaptooctanoic acid or dihydrolipoate. In yet another embodiment, the active agent is 5-(1,2-dithiolan-3-yl)pentanoic acid.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The active agent can also be in a salt or ester form.</p>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The active agent can be administered as a racemate or as an enantiomer. Lipoic acid and its derivatives are preferably administered to include the R form. Synthetic methods to yield a racemate may be less expensive than stereo-specific processes including isolation/purification steps. On the other hand, administering a single enantiomer can lower the therapeutically effective amount, thus decreasing any toxicity effects of the active agent.</p>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">As the agents described herein may have therapeutic uses as described in further detail below, it is preferable to select an active agent with low toxicity. Additional acceptable lipoic acid derivatives can be selected by in vitro toxicology testing. See Example 1.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The agents described herein can be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to provide pharmaceutical compositions. The pharmaceutical composition may also contain one or more excipients as is well known in the art of pharmaceutical formulary. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is formulated for ocular use. That is, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or other excipients are selected to be compatible with, and suitable for, ocular use. Such carriers and excipients are well known in the art. The excipients may also be selected and/or formulated to improve the solubility of the agent. For example, the pharmaceutical composition can include one or more of emulsifiers, buffers, salts, preservatives, lubricants, polymers, solvents, and other known excipients for ocular pharmaceutical formulations. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition includes an emulsifier and a buffered carrier such as Polysorbate 80 in HBSS (Hank's Balanced Salt Solution).</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The agents can also be administered with a chemical energy source, such as portion of glucose or NADPH, to facilitate reduction. The agent and chemical energy source can be co-formulated (e.g., prepared together in a single pharmaceutical formulation) or co-administered (administered simultaneously or consecutively in any order in individual formulations).</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition contains a low dose of the active agent. In one embodiment, the concentration of a lipoic acid-based active agent in the pharmaceutical composition is about 0.0002 to 0.05 weight percent, more preferably about 0.0002 to 0.02, 0.001 to 0.02, or 0.002 to 0.02 weight percent. In another embodiment, the concentration of a lipoic acid-based active agent in the pharmaceutical composition is less than 0.05, 0.02, 0.01, 0.002, 0.001, or 0.0002 weight percent.</p>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Although lipoic acid is a naturally occurring substance in the eye, and exogenous lipoic acid has been used before in various contexts, the present inventors have surprisingly found that a dramatic reduction in formulation and dosing amounts is possible with little if any effect on efficacy. For example, previous attempts to use lipoic acid to improve accommodation required concentrations of 0.05 - 0.2 weight percent (see <patcit id="pcit-00004" dnum="US5817630A"><text>U.S. Patent 5,817,630</text></patcit>). However, the present inventors have discovered that the concentration may be lowered, in some cases lowered by orders of magnitude, with little if any decrease in efficacy. This discovery has important synthesis, formulation, and toxicity implications. Regarding the synthesis, the formulation and dosing amounts may be further reduced by isolating the R enantiomer as described above. Regarding the formulation, the dosage of the lipoic acid-based active agent can be, e.g., 0.001 to 0.02 weight percent while still maintaining equal efficacy to doses of 1 mM or greater. This demonstrated efficacy in turn reduces any concomitant toxicity, thereby achieving a more desirable safety and efficacy profile. Moreover, when the active agent is used in combination with other active components, such as, e.g., a photolabile protecting group as described in the co-pending U.S. Patent Application describing caged compounds, the ability to reduce the dose of lipoic acid also reduces the dose of the accompanying protecting group. Thus, lowering the dose of the lipoic acid-based active agent achieves a reduction in toxicity for all accompanying components.</p>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The agents described herein can be employed in a method including the step of providing a lipoic acid-based active agent to a cell, either in vitro or in vivo.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The agents described herein can be employed in a method for treating or preventing oxidation damage to cells. Such a method includes the step of administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising a lipoic acid-based active agent to a cell, either in vitro or in vivo.</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">As stated above, the agents can be delivered to cells in vitro or in vivo. In one embodiment, the cells are in vivo. In either case, the cells can be ocular cells, e.g., lens cells. In one embodiment, the agent is delivered to a lens, either in vitro or in vivo. Because oxidative damage has been implicated in other disorders including cancer, the agents may prove useful for administration to any type of cell exhibiting or prone to oxidative damage.</p>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The agents can be administered to a lens by any route of administration including, but not limited to, topical ocular, subtenons, subconjunctival, intracameral, intravitreal, or iontophoresis routes. In one embodiment, the agent can be delivered topically, e.g., via an eye drop, gel, ointment, or salve. In other embodiment, the agent can be delivered via an acute delivery system, e.g., using nanotubes, local injection, micro-injection, syringe or scleral deposition, or ultrasound. The delivery systems can be adapted to delivery the agent to a target region, e.g., an area exhibiting inelasticity, opacity, and/or proliferation. In one embodiment, the agent can be localized to the anterior central portion of the lens.</p>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The method can further include applying energy. Exemplary forms of applied energy include, but are not limited to, laser, ultrasound, tuned and focused ultrasound, particle beam, plasma beam, X-ray, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, heat, ionizing, light, magnetic, microwave, sound, electrical, femtosecond laser, and tuned femtosecond laser. Additionally or alternatively, the energy can be applied to only a localized area of the target. In some embodiment, energy is applied using an LED or laser source, which advantageously enables spatial specificity to deliver light to a localized region. Additionally or alternatively, other optical tools for creating and/or improving spatial specificity can be used with the methods described herein. The energy can be targeted to particular areas, e.g., areas exhibiting inelasticity, opacity, and/or proliferation, while leaving other areas unaffected. In one embodiment, the energy can be localized to the anterior central portion of the lens. This step can be performed as previously disclosed in co-pending <patcit id="pcit-00005" dnum="US20080139990A"><text>U.S. Publication 2008/0139990</text></patcit> or co-pending U.S. Patent Application describing caged compounds.</p>
    <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The energy can be applied within the "activation volume" to change the flexibility of the lens so that the restoring force of the lens capsule is able to form the lens to a maximal spherical shape with increased curvature. The "activation volume" would be limited only by the available dilation of the patient papillary area although a smaller area may suffice to restore accommodative amplitude.</p>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The methods preferably utilize a therapeutically effective amount of the active agent. The term "therapeutically effective amount" means an amount that is capable of preventing, reducing, reversing, and/or slowing the rate of oxidative damage. For ocular applications, a therapeutically effective amount may be determined by measuring clinical outcomes including, but not limited to, the elasticity, stiffness, viscosity, density, or opacity of a lens.</p>
    <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Lens elasticity decreases with age, and is a primary diagnostic and causative factor for presbyopia. Lens elasticity can be measured as accommodative amplitude in diopters (D). <figref>Fig. 1</figref> depicts the average elasticity in diopters of an untreated human lens as a function of age in years. The lower the value of D, the less elastic the lens. In one embodiment, the agents described herein (in the active form) can decrease and/or maintain D at a value that is greater than the D value exhibited by an untreated lens of about the same age. In other words, the agents can keep accommodative amplitude "above the line" (the solid line mean accommodative amplitude) depicted in <figref>Fig. 1</figref>. In one embodiment, D is increased and/or maintained at a value about 2, 5, 7,10,15, 25, 50, 100, 150, or 200 percent above the line. However, as individual lenses may differ with respect to average values, another embodiment provides any increase in accommodative amplitude, maintenance of accommodative amplitude, or reduction in the rate of decline of accommodative amplitude (i.e., reduction in the rate of decrease in diopters) for an individual lens compared to the accommodative amplitude of the same lens before treatment. Accordingly, in another embodiment, the methods provide an increase in accommodative amplitude of about 0.25 to about 8 diopters, or at least about 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, or 8 diopters compared to the same lens before treatment.</p>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Lens elasticity can also be measured by the unit of elasticity E. The higher the value of E, the less elastic the lens. <figref>Fig. 2</figref> depicts the average elasticity (E) of an untreated human lens as a function of age in years. In one embodiment, the agents described herein (in the active form) can decrease and/or maintain E at a value that is less than the E value exhibited by an untreated lens of about the same age. In other words, the agents can keep lens elasticity "below the line" depicted in <figref>Fig. 2</figref>. In one embodiment, E is decreased and/or maintained at a value about 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 25, 50, 100, 150, or 200 percent below the line. However, as individual lenses may differ with respect to average values, another embodiment provides any increase inelasticity, maintenance of elasticity, or reduction in the rate of decline of elasticity (i.e., reduction in the rate of increase in E value) for an individual lens compared to the elasticity of the same lens before treatment.</p>
    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Therapeutic efficacy can also be measured in terms of lens opacity. Lens opacity increases with age and is a primary diagnostic and causative factor for cataract. <figref>Fig. 3</figref> depicts the average opacity of an untreated human lens as a function of age in years. In one embodiment, the agents described herein (in the active form) can decrease and/or maintain opacity at a value that is less than the opacity value exhibited by an untreated lens of about the same age. In other words, the agents can keep lens opacity "below the line" depicted in <figref>Fig. 3</figref>. In one embodiment, lens elasticity is decreased and/or maintained at a value about 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 25, 50, 100, 150, or 200 percent below the line. However, as individual lenses may differ with respect to average values, another embodiment provides any decrease, maintenance, or reduction in the rate of increase of opacity for an individual lens compared to the opacity of the same lens before treatment.</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Therapeutic efficacy can also be measured as a reduction in the rate of cell proliferation, particularly lens epithelial cell proliferation. Thus, in some embodiments, therapeutic efficacy can be measured by cytostatic effect.</p>
    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Some agents described herein exist naturally in the untreated eye. Lipoic acid, for example, occurs naturally in eye tissue. In general, a therapeutically effective amount of the exogenously administered agent is often at least about 1 or 2 orders of magnitude larger than the natural level of the compound. In one embodiment, the dose amount of lipoic acid or a derivative thereof is about 5 µM to about 250 µM or about 10 µM to about 100 µM. In another embodiment, the dose amount of lipoic acid or derivative thereof is no more than about 250 µM, 100 µM, 50 µM, 20 µM, 10 µM. The dose amount will depend on the route of administration as well as the age and condition of the patient. Similarly, the frequency of dosing will depend on similar factors as can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
    <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Efficacy has been demonstrated in vitro for specific exemplary dosing. (See Example 2) <figref>Fig. 2</figref> shows that the inelasticity increases by a factor of nearly 20 during the critical period from age 40 to 55 years. From current data, a 10 µM dose can decrease the inelasticity over 95% within a millimeter volume element (voxel). Extrapolation of these results to a volume element in the human lens suggests that using this treatment dose on a 55 year old person with a10 kPA lens starting modulus value (see <figref>Fig. 2</figref>) could be reduced after treatment to a value of about 0.5 kPA (which then corresponds to a value typically seen with a 40 yr old person). <figref>Fig. 1</figref> permits a conversion of these modulus values to optical amplitude: accommodative amplitude is normally reduced to almost 0 above 55 years, while a person at 40-45 years still exhibits around 4-5 diopters of accommodation.</p>
    <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The methods include preventative methods that can be performed on patients of any age. The methods also include therapeutic methods that can be performed on patients of any age, particularly patients that are 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 52, 55, 57, 60, 70, 75, or 80 years of age or older.</p>
    <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Any numerical values recited herein include all values from the lower value to the upper value in increments of any measurable degree of precision. For example, if the value of a variable such as age, amount, time, percent increase/decrease and the like is 1 to 90, specifically from 20 to 80, and more specifically from 30 to 70, it is intended that values such as 15 to 85, 22 to 68, 43 to 51, 30.3 to 32, etc., are expressly enumerated in this specification. In other words, all possible combinations of numerical values between the lowest value and the highest value enumerated are to be considered to be expressly stated in this application in a similar manner.</p>

      <i>Increase in Elasticity:</i> Pairs of mouse lenses were incubated in medium 200 supplemented with an antibiotic, an antimycotic, in the presence or absence of lipoic acid (concentrations ranging from 0.5 µM to 500 µM) for 8-15 hours. Each lens was removed from medium, weighed, and photographed on a micrometer scale. A coverslip of known weight (0.17899 ± 0.00200 g) was placed on the lens, and the lens was photographed again on the micrometer scale. The diameter of each lens with and without the coverslip was determined from the photographs. The change in lens diameter produced by the force (coverslip) was computed ΔD = (D<sub>withcoverslip</sub> - D<sub>withoutcoverslip</sub>). The results (<figref>Fig. 4</figref>, ‡) indicate that lipoic acid at concentrations ≥ 9.6 µM caused a statistically significant increase in ΔD, p &lt; 0.0001.</p>
