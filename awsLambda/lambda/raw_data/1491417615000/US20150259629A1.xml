      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention is concerned with the delivery of particles comprising benefit agents and/or deposition aids, to substrates, with processes for the manufacture of said particles and the manufacture and use of formulations comprising the same. It will be specifically described herein with reference to laundry treatment compositions but has other and broader applications.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Many home care and personal care formulations seek to deliver benefit agents to substrates such as textiles, hard surfaces, hair and skin. Encapsulation of the benefit agent in particles has been proposed as a means of enhancing delivery. Encapsulation of perfumes has generated particular interest and activity in recent years.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Leakage of the benefit agent from the encapsulating particle over time is a known problem with many encapsulates. Leakage into the formulation into which the encapsulate particle has been incorporated leads to instability problems as well as performance issues. Performance issues include not only loss of perfume intensity but also loss of timing of perfume delivery.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">WO 12/085864 Discloses a population of encapsulates, the encapsulates comprising a shell and a core, said shell comprising a polyamide polymer that forms a wall that encapsulates said core, said core comprising a perfume composition. The perfume composition comprises perfume raw materials having a C log P of from 2 to 4.5; the encapsulate has a diameter of from 1 to 100 microns and a fracture strength of from 0.1 to 5 MPa.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 4,145,184 Discloses a laundry detergent composition comprising, a laundry detergent composition comprising: (a) from 2 to 95 percent of a surfactant selected from the group consisting of anionic, nonionic, ampholytic and zwitterionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof; and (b) an effective amount of a perfuming agent comprising a perfume encapsulated in water insoluble, friable microcapsules having an average size of from 5 to 300 microns. The microcapsules have a shell wall material of polyamide.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">WO 09/047745 Discloses a composition comprising an encapsulate comprising a core comprising a benefit agent and a shell that at least encapsulates said core, said encapsulate further comprising a density balancing agent, said composition being a consumer product. The encapsulate's benefit agent is selected from perfume and shell comprises polyamides.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">WO 11/056904 Discloses an encapsulate comprising a) a core, comprising perfume and b) shell comprising polyamides.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">WO 10/105922 Discloses particles comprising a waxy solid and a polymeric deposition aid having no overall cationic charge, wherein the polymeric deposition aid is partially embedded in the waxy solid.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">EP1640063 Discloses polyamide microcapsules of mean diameter 0.0001-5 mm produced by (a) preparing an aqueous phase (a1)) containing a di- and/or tri-amine (I); (b) preparing an oil phase containing an oil body (b1), dicarboxylic acid chloride (b2) and tricarboxylic acid chloride (b3) and (c) contacting (a) and (b) to form an emulsion so that polycondensation occurs at the phase boundary.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">WO 11/161265 Discloses polyurea and polyamide capsules containing fragrance oils, wherein the oils contain precursors of fragrant aldehydes that are adapted to release the aldehydes under activating conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">We have now determined that improved particles comprise a shell which comprises a polyamide (which comprises an aromatic group) and a core comprising a benefit agent and an optional deposition aid. The benefit agent comprises 70-100 wt %, by total weight of the benefit agent, of a component selected from tertiary alcohols, alpha substituted aldehydes, aliphatic and aromatic ketones and ketenes and mixtures thereof, excluding cyclic aliphatic materials containing polar functional groups; further, the perfume is substantially free from aliphatic primary alcohols and aromatic primary alcohols and contains less than 15 wt %, i.e. from 0 to &lt;15 wt %, preferably from 0 to 14 wt % of aliphatic aldehydes having a chain length of from 8 to 22, by total weight of the benefit agent. Surprisingly, by using these new particles, leakage is much reduced or avoided altogether and perfume is efficiently and timely delivered.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="2">The Particle</heading>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0019">The core is typically formed in an inner region of the particle and provides a sink for the benefit agent. The âshellâ protects the benefit agent and regulates the flow of benefit agent into and out of the core.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="2">Particle Size</heading>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0020">The person of ordinary skill in the art will know how to measure the particle size distribution of the capsules, for example, by utilising a Malvern Mastersizer 2000. Typically, the particle has an average diameter of less than 5-50 micron, preferably from 10 to 40 micron, more preferably from 25 to 35 and most preferably 30 micron.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">The Core</heading>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0021">The core comprises one or more benefit agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0022">Advantageously the benefit agent is a hydrophobic benefit agent, preferably an organoleptic benefit agent, for example a flavour or fragrance (the terms âfragranceâ and âperfumeâ are used interchangeably herein).</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0023">The benefit agent comprises from 70 to 100 wt %, preferably 70 to 90 wt %, by total weight of the benefit agent, of a component selected from tertiary alcohols, alpha substituted aldehydes, aliphatic and aromatic ketones and ketenes and mixtures thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0024">Further, the benefit agent is substantially free from i) aliphatic primary alcohols and ii) aromatic primary alcohols and preferably comprises from 0 to 15 wt % of aliphatic aldehydes having a chain length of from 8 to 22, by total weight of the benefit agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0025">As used herein, by substantially free is meant from 0 to 0.5 wt %, preferably from 0 to 0.05 wt %, more preferably from 0 to 0.005 wt %, even more preferably from 0 to 0.0005 wt %, and most preferably 0 wt % by total weight of the benefit agent. Aliphatic aldehydes having a chain length of greater than 12, preferably in the range of from 13 to 18 may be present.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">Benefit Agents:</heading>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0026">The benefit agent comprises 70-100 wt %, by total weight of the benefit agent, of a component selected from tertiary alcohols, alpha substituted aldehydes, aliphatic and aromatic ketones and ketenes and mixtures thereof, excluding cyclic aliphatic materials containing polar functional groups; and the benefit agent is substantially free from i) aliphatic primary alcohols and ii) aromatic primary alcohols and contains less than 15 wt %, i.e. from 0 to &lt;15 wt %, preferably from 0 to 14 wt % of aliphatic aldehydes having a chain length of from 8 to 22, by total weight of the benefit agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0027">Various benefit agents can be incorporated into the particles. Mixtures of benefit agents may be used. Where the end use of the particles is in connection with a surfactant-containing system, any compatible benefit agent which can provide a benefit to a substrate which is treated with a surfactant composition can be used. Preferred benefit agents are in the laundry field, for example fabric benefit agents, and benefit agents which provide a benefit to a laundry wash and/or rinse medium. In the alternative benefit agents may provide a skin or hair related benefit. Advantages of the particles of the invention in the presence of surfactant are a good retention of the benefit agent on storage of a formulation and controllable release of the benefit agent during and after product usage.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0028">Preferred examples include flavours, fragrances, enzymes, antifoams, fluorescer, shading dyes and/or pigments, conditioning agents (for example water-insoluble quaternary ammonium materials and/or silicones), sunscreens, ceramides, antioxidants, reducing agents, sequestrants, colour care additives, density matching polymers, photo-bleaches, lubricants, unsaturated oils, emollients/moisturiser and antimicrobial agents, and mixtures thereof, most preferred are fragrances and antimicrobial agents.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0029">Preferred antimicrobials include Triclosanâ¢, climbazole, octapyrox, ketoconizole, zinc pyrithione, and quaternary ammonium compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0030">Preferred sunscreens and/or skin lightening agents are vitamin B3 compounds. Suitable vitamin B3 compounds are selected from niacin, niacinamide, nicotinyl alcohol, or derivatives or salts thereof. Other vitamins which act as skin lightening agents can be advantageously included in the skin lightening composition to provide for additional skin lightening effects. These include vitamin B6, vitamin C, vitamin A or their precursors. Mixtures of the vitamins can also be employed in the composition of the invention. An especially preferred additional vitamin is vitamin B6. Other non-limiting examples of skin lightening agents useful herein include adapalene, aloe extract, ammonium lactate, arbutin, azelaic acid, butyl hydroxy anisole, butyl hydroxy toluene, citrate esters, deoxyarbutin, 1,3 diphenyl propane derivatives, 2,5 di hydroxyl benzoic acid a nd its derivatives, 2-(4-acetoxyphenyl)-1,3 dithane, 2-(4-Hydroxylphenyl)-1,3 dithane, ellagic acid, gluco pyranosyl-1-ascorbate, gluconic acid, glycolic acid, green tea extract, 4-Hydroxy-5-methyl-3[2H]-furanone, hydroquinone, 4 hydroxyanisole and its derivatives, 4-hydroxy benzoic acid derivatives, hydroxycaprylic acid, inositol ascorbate, kojic acid, lactic acid, lemon extract, linoleic acid, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, 5-octanoyl salicylic acid, 2,4 resorcinol derivatives, 3,5 resorcinol derivatives, salicylic acid, 3,4,5 trihydroxybenzyl derivatives, and mixtures thereof. Preferred sunscreens useful in the present invention are 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate, butyl methoxy dibenzoylmethane, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, octyl dimethyl-p-aminobenzoic acid and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred sunscreen is chosen from 2-ethyl hexyl-p-methoxycinnamate, 4,-t-butyl-4â²-methoxydibenzoyl-methane or mixtures thereof. Other conventional sunscreen agents that are suitable for use in the skin lightening composition of the invention include 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, octyldimethyl-p-aminobenzoic acid, digalloyltrioleate, 2,2-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, ethyl-4-(bis(hydroxypropyl))aminobenzoate, 2-ethylhexyl-2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylate, 2-ethylhexylsalicylate, glyceryl-p-aminobenzoate, 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexyl-salicylate, methylanthranilate, p-dimethyl-aminobenzoic acid or aminobenzoate, 2-ethylhexyl-p-dimethyl-amino-benzoate, 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid, 2-(p-dimethylaminophenyl)-5-sulfonic benzoxazoic acid and mixtures of these compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0031">Preferred anti-oxidants include vitamin E, retinol, antioxiants based on hydroxytoluene such as Irganoxâ¢ or commercially available antioxidants such as the Trolloxâ¢ series.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0032">Perfume and fragrance materials (which include pro-fragrances) are a particularly preferred benefit agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0033">The pro-fragrance can, for example, be a food lipid. Food lipids typically contain structural units with pronounced hydrophobicity. The majority of lipids are derived from fatty acids. In these âacylâ lipids the fatty acids are predominantly present as esters and include mono-, di-, triacyl glycerols, phospholipids, glycolipids, diol lipids, waxes, sterol esters and tocopherols. In their natural state, plant lipids comprise antioxidants to prevent their oxidation. While these may be at least in part removed during the isolation of oils from plants some antioxidants may remain. These antioxidants can be pro-fragrances. In particular, the carotenoids and related compounds including vitamin A, retinol, retinal, retinoic acid and provitamin A are capable of being converted into fragrant species including the ionones, damascones and damscenones. Preferred pro-fragrance food lipids include olive oil, palm oil, canola oil, squalene, sunflower seed oil, wheat germ oil, almond oil, coconut oil, grape seed oil, rapeseed oil, castor oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, groundnut oil, poppy seed oil, palm kernel oil, rice bran oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, pumpkin seed oil, jojoba oil and mustard seed oil. Perfume components which are odiferous materials are described in further detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0034">The perfume is typically present in an amount of from 10-85% by total weight of the particle, preferably from 15 to 75% by total weight of the particle. The perfume suitably has a molecular weight of from 50 to 500 Dalton. Pro-fragrances can be of higher molecular weight, being typically 1-10 kD.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0035">Useful components of the perfume include materials of both natural and synthetic origin. They include single compounds and mixtures. Specific examples of such components may be found in the current literature, e.g., in Fenaroli's Handbook of Flavour Ingredients, 1975, CRC Press; Synthetic Food Adjuncts, 1947 by M. B. Jacobs, edited by Van Nostrand; or Perfume and Flavour Chemicals by S. Arctander 1969, Montclair, N.J. (USA). These substances are well known to the person skilled in the art of perfuming, flavouring, and/or aromatizing consumer products, i.e., of imparting an odour and/or a flavour or taste to a consumer product traditionally perfumed or flavoured, or of modifying the odour and/or taste of said consumer product.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0036">By perfume in this context is not only meant a fully formulated product fragrance, but also selected components of that fragrance, particularly those which are prone to loss, such as the so-called âtop notesâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0037">Top notes are defined by Poucher (Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists 6(2):80 [1955]). Examples of well known top-notes include citrus oils, linalool, linalyl acetate, lavender, dihydromyrcenol, rose oxide and cis-3-hexanol. Top notes typically comprise 15-25% wt of a perfume composition and in those embodiments of the invention which contain an increased level of top-notes it is envisaged at that least 20% wt would be present within the particle.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0038">Typical perfume components which it is advantageous to employ in the embodiments of the present invention include those with a relatively low boiling point, preferably those with a boiling point of less than 300, preferably 100-250 Celsius.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0039">It is also advantageous to encapsulate perfume components which have a low Log P (i.e. those which will be partitioned into water), preferably with a Log P of less than 3.0. These materials, of relatively low boiling point and relatively low Log P have been called the âdelayed bloomingâ perfume ingredients and include the following materials:</p>

      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0041">It is commonplace for a plurality of perfume components to be present in a formulation. In the encapsulates of the present invention it is envisaged that there may be four or more, preferably five or more, more preferably six or more or even seven or more different perfume components from the list given of delayed blooming perfumes given above present in the particles.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0042">Another group of perfumes with which the present invention can be applied are the so-called âaromatherapyâ materials. These include many components also used in perfumery, including components of essential oils such as Clary Sage, Eucalyptus, Geranium, Lavender, Mace Extract, Neroli, Nutmeg, Spearmint, Sweet Violet Leaf and Valerian. By means of the present invention these materials can be transferred to textile articles that will be worn or otherwise come into contact with the human body (such as handkerchiefs and bed linen).</p>

In particularly preferred embodiments the deposition aid is substantive to proteinaceous, cellulosic, polyester, lipid or polyamide surfaces. By use of such a deposition aid, the efficiency of delivery to a specific substrate may be enhanced.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0048">Deposition aids modify the properties of the exterior of the particle. One particular benefit which can be obtained with these materials is to make the particle more substantive to a desired substrate.

      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0062">The benefit agent may be present in the reaction mixture, at a level to give the benefit agent levels in the resulting particles at the levels disclosed above, although it is also possible to form âemptyâ particles (with or without a benefit agent carrier, for example wax) and subsequently expose them to a benefit agent which can be adsorbed into the inner region.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0063">Deposition aids are generally added to the aqueous phase towards the end of the process, where, for example, further monomer(s) can be added to form further shell material and bind additional materials to the outside of the particle.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0064">Deposition aid may added at the end of the later phase (preferably after cooling), when for example, further shell forming material (for example further isocyanate and co-monomer) are also added to bind the deposition aid to the outer surface of the particle by the formation of further shell material which entraps a portion of the deposition aid and leads to a âhairyâ particle in which the âhairâ comprises the deposition aid.</p>

Many suitable surface active compounds are available and are fully described in the literature, for example, in âSurface-Active Agents and Detergentsâ, Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch. The preferred surface-active compounds that can be used are soaps and synthetic non soap anionic, and non-ionic compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0071">The compositions of the invention may contain linear alkylbenzene sulphonate, particularly linear alkylbenzene sulphonates having an alkyl chain length of from C8 to C15.

If the fabric conditioning compound is to be employed in a main wash detergent composition the compound will typically be non-ionic. For use in the rinse phase, typically they will be cationic. They may for example be used in amounts from 0.5% to 35%, preferably from 1% to 30% more preferably from 3% to 25% by weight of a fully formulated composition comprising the particles of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0076">Suitable cationic fabric softening compounds are substantially water-insoluble quaternary ammonium materials comprising a single alkyl or alkenyl long chain having an average chain length greater than or equal to C20 or, more preferably, compounds comprising a polar head group and two alkyl or alkenyl chains having an average chain length greater than or equal to C14.

      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0084">The choice of surface-active compound (surfactant), and the amount present, will depend on the intended use of the detergent composition. In fabric washing compositions, different surfactant systems may be chosen, as is well known to the skilled formulator, for hand-washing products and for products intended for use in different types of washing machine.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0085">The total amount of surfactant present will also depend on the intended end use and may, in fully formulated products, be as high as 60 wt %, for example, in a composition for washing fabrics by hand. In compositions for machine washing of fabrics, an amount of from 5 to 40 wt % is generally appropriate. Typically compositions will comprise at least 2 wt % surfactant e.g. 2-60%, preferably 15-40% most preferably 25-35%, by weight.</p>

This list is not intended to be exhaustive.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0094">Especially preferred organic builders are citrates, suitably used in fully formulated compositions in amounts of from 5 to 30 wt %, preferably from 10 to 25 wt %; and acrylic polymers, more especially acrylic/maleic copolymers, suitably used in amounts of from 0.5 to 15 wt %, preferably from 1 to 10 wt %.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0095">Builders, both inorganic and organic, are preferably present in alkali metal salt, especially sodium salt, form.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0096">Compositions comprising particles according to the invention may also suitably contain a bleach system. Fabric washing compositions may desirably contain peroxy bleach compounds, for example, inorganic persalts or organic peroxyacids, capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0097">Suitable peroxy bleach compounds include organic peroxides such as urea peroxide, and inorganic persalts such as the alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates, persilicates and persulphates. Preferred inorganic persalts are sodium perborate monohydrate and tetrahydrate, and sodium percarbonate.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0098">Especially preferred is sodium percarbonate having a protective coating against destabilisation by moisture. Sodium percarbonate having a protective coating comprising sodium metaborate and sodium silicate is disclosed in GB 2 123 044B (Kao).</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0099">The peroxy bleach compound is suitably present in a fully formulated product in an amount of from 0.1 to 35 wt %, preferably from 0.5 to 25 wt %. The peroxy bleach compound may be used in conjunction with a bleach activator (bleach precursor) to improve bleaching action at low wash temperatures. The bleach precursor is suitably present in an amount of from 0.1 to 8 wt %, preferably from 0.5 to 5 wt %.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0100">Preferred bleach precursors are peroxycarboxylic acid precursors, more especially peracetic acid precursors and pernoanoic acid precursors. Especially preferred bleach precursors suitable for use in the present invention are N,N,Nâ²,Nâ²,tetracetyl ethylenediamine (TAED) and sodium nonanoyloxybenzene sulphonate (SNOBS). The novel quaternary ammonium and phosphonium bleach precursors disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,751,015 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,818,426 (Lever Brothers Company) and EP 402 971A (Unilever), and the cationic bleach precursors disclosed in EP 284 292A and EP 303 520A (Kao) are also of interest.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0101">The bleach system can be either supplemented with or replaced by a peroxyacid. Examples of such peracids can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,686,063 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,397,501 (Unilever). A preferred example is the imido peroxycarboxylic class of peracids described in EP A 325 288, EP A 349 940, DE 382 3172 and EP 325 289. A particularly preferred example is phthalimido peroxy caproic acid (PAP). Such peracids are suitably present at 0.1-12% wt, preferably 0.5-10% wt.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0102">A bleach stabiliser (transition metal sequestrant) may also be present in fully formulated products. Suitable bleach stabilisers include ethylenediamine tetra-acetate (EDTA), the polyphosphonates such as Dequest (Trade Mark) and non phosphate stabilisers such as EDDS (ethylene diamine di succinic acid). These bleach stabilisers are also useful for stain removal especially in end-products containing low levels of bleaching species or no bleaching species.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0103">An especially preferred bleach system comprises a peroxy bleach compound (preferably sodium percarbonate optionally together with a bleach activator), and a transition metal bleach catalyst as described and claimed in EP 458 397A, EP 458 398A and EP 509 787A (Unilever).</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0104">Advantageously in the compositions of the invention benefit agents, particularly, perfume components may be employed which are sensitive to bleaches as the encapsulation of, for example, the perfume component within the particles will provide some degree of protection to the perfume component or other benefit agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0105">The fully formulated compositions may also contain one or more enzyme(s). Suitable enzymes include the proteases, amylases, cellulases, oxidases, peroxidases and lipases usable for incorporation in detergent compositions. Preferred proteolytic enzymes (proteases) are, catalytically active protein materials which degrade or alter protein types of stains when present as in fabric stains in a hydrolysis reaction. They may be of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial or yeast origin.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0106">Proteolytic enzymes or proteases of various qualities and origins and having activity in various pH ranges of from 4-12 are available and can be used in the instant invention. Examples of suitable proteolytic enzymes are the subtilisins which are obtained from particular strains of B. <i>Subtilis B. licheniformis</i>, such as the commercially available subtilisins Maxatase (Trade Mark), as supplied by Genencor International N.V., Delft, Holland, and Alcalase (Trade Mark), as supplied by Novozymes Industri A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0107">Particularly suitable is a protease obtained from a strain of <i>Bacillus </i>having maximum activity throughout the pH range of 8-12, being commercially available, e.g. from Novozymes Industri NS under the registered trade names Esperase (Trade Mark) and Savinase (Trade Mark). The preparation of these and analogous enzymes is described in GB 1 243 785. Other commercial proteases are Kazusase (Trade Mark obtainable from Showa Denko of Japan), Optimase (Trade Mark from Miles Kali Chemie, Hannover, West Germany), and Superase (Trade Mark obtainable from Pfizer of U.S.A.).</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0108">Detergency enzymes are commonly employed in fully formulated products in granular form in amounts of from about 0.1 to about 3.0 wt % on product. However, any suitable physical form of enzyme may be used. Advantageously in the compositions of the invention benefit agents, for example, perfume components, may be employed which are sensitive to enzymes as the encapsulation of the perfume component (or other benefit agent) within the particles will provide some degree of protection to the perfume component (or other benefit agent).</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0109">The compositions of the invention may contain alkali metal, preferably sodium carbonate, in order to increase detergency and ease processing. Sodium carbonate may suitably be present in fully formulated products in amounts ranging from 1 to 60 wt %, preferably from 2 to 40 wt %. However, compositions containing little or no sodium carbonate are also within the scope of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0110">The fully formulated detergent composition when diluted in the wash liquor (during a typical wash cycle) will typically give a pH of the wash liquor from 7 to 10.5 for a main wash detergent.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0111">Particulate detergent compositions are suitably prepared by spray drying a slurry of compatible heat insensitive ingredients, and then spraying on or post-dosing those ingredients unsuitable for processing via the slurry. The skilled detergent formulator will have no difficulty in deciding which ingredients should be included in the slurry and which should not. It is particularly useful to add the perfume particles of the present invention via post-dosing.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0112">Particulate detergent compositions preferably have a bulk density of at least 400 g/litre, more preferably at least 500 g/litre. Especially preferred compositions have bulk densities of at least 650 g/litre, more preferably at least 700 g/litre.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0113">Such powders may be prepared either by post tower densification of spray dried powder, or by wholly non tower methods such as dry mixing and granulation; in both cases a high-speed mixer/granulator may advantageously be used. Processes using high speed mixer/granulators are disclosed, for example, in EP 340 013A, EP 367 339A, EP 390 251A and EP 420 317A (Unilever).</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0114">Liquid detergent compositions can be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients thereof in any desired order to provide compositions containing components in the requisite concentrations. Liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in compact form which means it will contain a lower level of water compared to a conventional liquid detergent.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0115">In order that the present invention may be still further understood and carried forth into practice it will be further described with reference to the following examples:</p>

      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0118">Capsule 1X and Capsule 1Y, comprising perfume X and perfume Y respectively, were prepared using the following method:â</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0119">Step 1:âThe following liquids were prepared:â</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0120">Liquid A: 2.4 ml perfume (X or Y) and 0.27 g terephthaloyl chloride were mixed until the terephthaloyl chloride dissolved to obtain an oily liquid.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0121">Water solution B: 30 ml deionised water containing 1 wt % PVA (5-88) was prepared and the pH adjusted to desired value using 1M NaOH.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0122">Water solution C: 3.9 ml DETA was dissolved in 6 ml deionised water.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0123">Step 2:âLiquid A was then added to solution B under homogenization at 6000 rpm and the mixture emulsified for 5 min. Solution C was then added dropwise into the emulsion and homogenization was continued for 10 min. The resulting suspension of polyamide capsules, designated âCapsule1Xâ or âCapsule 1Yâ was allowed to age for 24 h to obtain the capsule slurry for use in the following examples.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0124">Note regarding the preparation of Comparative Example AZ:â</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0125">The preparation method was the same as above except that Perfume raw materials, designated âZâ in Table 2 above were used for the preparation of Liquid A.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0126">It was found, however, that the viscosity of Liquid A increased continuously during the mixing process and the final mixture became a gel. A subsequent homogenisation of gelled Liquid A with water solution B was unsuccessful. Thus, the comparative example, which comprised perfume ingredients outwith the scope of the invention, failed.</p>

      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0128">The delivery of the polyamide perfume capsules, Capsule 1X or Capsule 1Y, to fabric during a model wash procedure was assessed as follows. <ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>1. Surfactant solution was prepared by dissolving LAS (dodecylbenzenesulphonic acid sodium salt) (5.0 g) and Synperonic A7 (5.0 g) in de-ionized water to a total of 1.0 litre. The surfactant concentration of the final solution was 1.0 g/L.</li><li>2. Base buffer stock solution was prepared by dissolving sodium carbonate (7.5 g) and sodium bicarbonate (2.4 g) in de-ionized water to a total of 1.0 litre. The base buffer concentration was 0.1 M.</li><li>3. 55 ml model wash liquor (1.0 g/L surfactant, 0.01 M base buffer) containing 800 ppm polyamide capsule (Capsule 1X or Capsule 1Y) was prepared in a 60 ml bottle and a 5.0 ml aliquot taken out for absorbance recording at 400 nm. This absorbance value represents 100% capsules in the wash solution prior to the bottle wash process.</li><li>4. One piece (20Ã20 cm) of non-fluorescent knitted polyester (a total weight of 5.2 g) or three pieces (10Ã10 cm) of non-fluorescent cotton fabric (total weight 4.5 g) were then placed into the bottle and the bottle sealed.</li><li>5. The bottle was then shaken at 125 rpm at 40Â° C. for 30 min to simulate a main wash procedure.</li><li>6. The fabrics were then removed and hand wrung before a 5.0 ml aliquot of the main wash liquor was taken out for absorbance recording at 400 nm. The amount of adsorbed polyamide capsules on the fabric was determined by turbidity difference before/after the step.</li><li>7. The bottle was then thoroughly rinsed and the wrung fabrics put in and 50 ml of deionised water added. The bottle was then shaken at 40Â° C. for 10 minutes at 125 rpm to simulate a rinse procedure.</li><li>8. The fabrics were then removed and wrung by hand as before. A 5.0 ml aliquot of the rinse liquor was taken out for absorbance recording at 400 nm. The amount of loss of adsorbed polyamide capsules from fabric in rinse 1 stage could be determined according to turbidity difference. This rinse procedure was repeated and the loss amount of capsules from fabric in this second rinse determined accordingly.</li></ul></p>

              <li>1.0 g of fabric was cut from the washed sheet and immersed in 50 ml ethanol in a bottle.</li>
              <li>The remaining fabric was line-dried at room temperature for 24 hr.</li>
              <li>The bottle was then shaken at 40Â° C. for 24 hr and the perfume extracted from fabric (perfume intensity after wash) evaluated using GC-MS. A further 1.0 g of fabric was cut from the line-dried fabric sheet and the perfume extracted using the same method shown above, and the perfume intensity (after drying) was evaluated utilizing GC-MS. Perfume X was followed by its linalool and limonene components, whilst for Perfume Y, linalyl acetate, ortho-tertiary-butyl cyclohexyl acetate (OTBCA) and cyclopentadecanolid were peaks were picked out.</li>
