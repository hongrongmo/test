      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In this embodiment, the switch assembly <b>5</b> at least includes a button guide rod <b>508</b>, a guide rod control mechanism and a button guide rod sensing member <b>509</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Two button guide rods <b>508</b> are provided, and are arranged in two guide rod seats <b>507</b> respectively, and the two button guide rods <b>508</b> are each reciprocately slidable along the axe of the respective guide rod seat <b>507</b>. A radial through hole <b>507</b><i>a </i>is provided on a side wall of a guide channel of the guide rod seat <b>507</b>, and the guide channel of the guide rod seat <b>507</b> is configured to be passed through by the button guide rod <b>508</b>, and a slidable roller <b>506</b> is arranged in the radial through hole. A length of the radial through hole <b>507</b><i>a </i>is smaller than a diameter of the roller <b>506</b>, and the button guide rod <b>508</b> can be axially locked by sliding inwardly with the roller <b>506</b>. The two button guide rods <b>508</b> of the switch assembly have the same structure as well as corresponding components thereof, thus are referred to with same reference numerals.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The guide rod control mechanism includes a shifting block <b>513</b> rotatable about an axis parallel to the button guide rods <b>508</b>, the rollers <b>506</b> of the two button guide rods <b>508</b> are arranged to directly face to the shifting block <b>513</b>, the shifting block <b>513</b> is provided with two circumferential wave-shaped portions <b>513</b><i>a </i>and <b>513</b><i>b </i>corresponding to the rollers <b>506</b>, and the circumferential wave-shaped portions <b>513</b><i>a </i>and <b>513</b><i>b </i>are configured to be driven by rotation of the shifting block <b>513</b> to drive the rollers <b>506</b> to slide along the radial through holes <b>507</b><i>a. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">With the structure of the two circumferential wave-shaped portions <b>513</b><i>a, </i>the rollers <b>506</b> at two sides of the circumferential wave-shaped portions are driven to simultaneously lock the respective button guide rods <b>508</b>, to simultaneously release the respective button guide rods <b>508</b>, or to lock one of the button guide rods <b>508</b> and release the other of the button guide rods <b>508</b> at one time.
