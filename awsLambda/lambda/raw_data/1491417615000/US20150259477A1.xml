      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to an episulfide compound, which is preferably usable for optical materials such as plastic lenses, prisms, optical fibers, information storage discs, filters or the like, especially for plastic lenses.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">A plastic lens is lightweight, highly tough and easy to be dyed. Properties required of a plastic lens are low specific gravity, high transparency, and low yellow index. Optical properties required of a plastic lens are high refractive index, high Abbe number, high heat resistance, and high strength. A high refractive index allows the lens to be thinner, and a high Abbe number decreases the chromatic aberration of the lens.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Recently, many organic compounds containing sulfur atoms produced for the purpose of providing a high refractive index and a high Abbe number have been reported. Among these compounds, polyepisulfide compounds containing sulfur atoms are known to provide a good balance of the refractive index and the Abbe number (Patent Document 1). Since polyepisulfide compounds are reactive with various types of compounds, compositions of polyepisulfide compounds and various types of compounds have been proposed for the purpose of enhancing the properties (Patent Documents 2 through 5).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">However, episulfide compounds, which are highly reactive, are difficult to be stored for a long time. A technique of storing episulfide compounds in a refrigerated state (Patent Document 6) and a technique of adding an epoxy compound containing a halogen group (Patent Document 7) have been proposed.</p>

      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0075">For producing an optical material by polymerizing and curing a composition for an optical material according to the present invention, it is preferable to add a polymerization catalyst. Examples of usable polymerization catalysts include amine, phosphine, onium salt, and the like. Especially, onium salt is preferable. Preferable examples of the onium salt are quaternary ammonium salt, quaternary phosphonium salt, tertiary sulfonium salt, and secondary iodonium salt. Among these, quaternary ammonium salt and quaternary phosphonium salt, which are highly compatible with the composition for an optical material, are more preferable. Quaternary phosphonium salt is still more preferable. Further preferable example of polymerization catalysts include quaternary ammonium salts such as tetra-n-butylammoniumbromide, triethylbenzylammoniumchloride, cetyldimethylbenzylammoniumchloride, 1-n-dodecylpyridiniumchloride, and the like; and quaternary phosphonium salts such as tetra-n-butylphosphoniumbromide, tetraphenylphosphoniumbromide, and the like. Among these, tetra-n-butylammoniumbromide, triethylbenzylammoniumchloride, and tetra-n-butylphosphoniumbromide are still more preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0076">The amount of the polymerization catalyst depends on the components of the composition, the mixing ratio, and the polymerization and curing method, and thus is not uniquely defined. The amount of the polymerization catalyst is, where the total amount of the composition for an optical material is 100% by mass, usually 0.0001% by mass to 10% by mass, preferably 0.001% by mass to 5% by mass, more preferably 0.01% by mass to 1% by mass, and most preferably 0.01% by mass to 0.5% by mass. When the amount of the polymerization catalyst is larger than 10% by mass, the polymerization may advance rapidly. When the amount of the polymerization catalyst is smaller than 0.0001% by mass, the composition for an optical material is not fully cured, which may result in an insufficient heat resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0077">For producing an optical material by use of a method according to the present invention, an additive such as an ultraviolet absorber, a bluing agent, a pigment or the like may be added to the composition for an optical material in order to improve the usability of the optical material to be obtained, needless to say.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0078">Preferable examples of the ultraviolet absorber include benzotriazole compounds. Especially preferable compounds are 2-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole, 5-chloro-2-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-2-hydroxyphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole, 2-(2-hydroxy-4-octylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole, 2-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole, 2-(2-hydroxy-4-ethoxyphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole, 2-(2-hydroxy-4-butoxyphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole, 2-(2-hydroxy-4-octyloxyphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole, and 2-(2-hydroxy-5-t-octylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0079">The amount of such an ultraviolet absorber is, where the total amount of the composition for an optical material is 100% by mass, usually 0.01 to 5% by mass.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0080">For polymerizing and thus curing the composition for an optical material, an polymerization adjusting agent may be added as necessary in order to, for example, extend the pot life or disperse the polymerization heat. Examples of the polymerization adjusting agent include halides of groups XIII to XVI in the long periodic table. Preferable compounds among these are halides of silicon, germanium, tin and antimony. More preferable compounds are chlorides of germanium, tin and antimony containing an alkyl group. Still more preferable compounds are dibutyltindichloride, butyltintrichloride, dioctyltindichloride, octyltintrichloride, dibutyldichlorogermanium, butyltrichlorogermanium, diphenyldichlorogermanium, phenyltrichlorogermanium, and triphenylantimonydichloride. Dibutyltindichloride is most preferable. The polymerization adjusting agents may be used independently or as a mixture of two or more thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0081">The amount of the polymerization adjusting agent is, where the total amount of the composition for an optical material is 100% by mass, usually 0.0001 to 5.0% by mass, preferably 0.0005 to 3.0% by mass, and more preferably 0.001 to 2.0% by mass. When the amount of the polymerization adjusting agent is smaller than 0.0001% by mass, a sufficient pot life is not guaranteed for the composition for an optical material to be obtained. When the amount of the polymerization adjusting agent is larger than 5.0% by mass, the composition for an optical material is not sufficiently cured, and the heat resistance of the optical material to be obtained may be decreased.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0082">The composition for an optical material thus obtained is injected into a mold or the like and polymerized to be formed into an optical material.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0083">For injecting the composition for an optical material according to the present invention, it is preferable to remove impurities by use of a filter or the like having a pore diameter of about 0.1 to 5 Î¼m. This is preferable from the point of view of improving the quality of the optical material.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0084">The composition for an optical material according to the present invention is usually polymerized as follows. The curing time is usually 1 to 100 hours, and the curing temperature is usually â10Â° C. to 140Â° C. The polymerization is performed by a step of maintaining the composition for an optical material at a predetermined polymerization temperature for a predetermined time duration, a step of raising the temperature in the range of 0.1Â° C. to 100Â° C./h, a step of lowering the temperature in the range of 0.1Â° C. to 100Â° C./h, or a combination of these steps.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0085">It is preferable to, after the curing is finished, anneal the obtained optical material at a temperature of 50 to 150Â° C. for about 10 minutes to 5 hours. This is preferable to remove distortion of the optical material according to the present invention. The obtained optical material may be subjected to a surface treatment as necessary such as, for example, dying, hard coating, impact resistance coating, reflection prevention, anti-fogging or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0086">The optical material according to the present invention is preferably used as a lens.</p>

Then, the obtained substance was deaerated at a vacuum degree of 1.3 kPa, and injected to a mold formed of two glass plates and a tape (for a flat plate having a thickness of 3.0 mm and a â4D lens). The substance was heated at 30Â° C. for 10 hours, had the temperature raised to 100Â° C. over 10 hours at a constant rate, and then was heated at 100Â° C. for 1 hour to be polymerized and cured. After being cooled, the substance was released from the mold and annealed at 110Â° C. for 60 minutes. Thus, a molded plate (a flat plate having a thickness of 3.0 mm and a â4D lens) was obtained. The light resistance of the flat plate was evaluated (color tone measurement), and the releasability of the â4D lens was evaluated. The results are shown in Table 2.</p>
