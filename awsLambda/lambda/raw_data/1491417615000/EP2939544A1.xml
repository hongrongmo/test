    <heading id="h-00002-en">[Background of the Invention]</heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Coffee beverages contain chlorogenic acids, one of polyphenols, such as chlorogenic acid, coffeic acid and ferulic acid. The chlorogenic acids are known to have excellent physiological activities such as an antihypertensive effect. However, when green coffee beans are roasted, hydroxyhydroquinone is inevitably generated. The hydroxyhydroquinone is reported to inhibit physiological actions of chlorogenic acids. Accordingly, to sufficiently excert the physiological actions of chlorogenic acids, it is advantageous to use roasted coffee beans containing a large amount of chlorogenic acids and a reduced amount of hydroxyhydroquinone. Then, as a method for producing roasted coffee beans having a reduced amount of hydroxyhydroquinone, for example, a method in which starting material roasted coffee beans (80 to 150°C under atmospheric pressure) is subjected to a heat treatment at a temperature of 90 to 150°C under vacuum conditions of 6.7 kPa or less, is proposed (Patent Document 1).</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Coffee beverages are very popular and favorite tasty beverages and roasted coffee beans useful as a starting material for a coffee beverage having good taste and flavor have been desired. For example, as a treatment method of roasted coffee beans for reducing the content of sourness components of roasted coffee beans and improving its extraction rate, thereby successfully extracting excellent flavor intrinsic to coffee beans, a water vapor treatment method in which water vapor is supplied to roasted coffee beans under aeration, is proposed (Patent Document 2). As a method for producing roasted coffee beans, which are useful as a starting material for a coffee beverage suppressed in unpleasant taste, a method in which starting material roasted coffee beans having an L value of 30 to 50 are placed in an airtight container and the roasted coffee beans is subjected to a heat treatment at from 100 to 160°C is proposed (Patent Document 3). Similarly, a method in which the starting material roasted coffee beans having an L value of 10 to 40 are subjected to a heat treatment at from 160 to 190°C is proposed (Patent Document 4).</p>

    <heading id="h-00004-en">[Summary of the Invention]</heading>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The present invention provides a method for producing roasted coffee beans, comprising placing starting material roasted coffee beans in an airtight container and subjecting the roasted coffee beans to a heat treatment at from 100 to 160°C under humidified conditions.</p>
    <heading id="h-00005-en">[Detailed Description of the Invention]</heading>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Taste and flavor of coffee contains various elements such as bitterness, sourness and sweetness, and these elements are well balanced to produce the taste and flavor of a coffee beverage. In addition, if depth and width of taste are enhanced, the consumer will feel body. Thus, if one of these elements of the coffee taste and flavor is reduced, balance of taste and flavor is disrupted, with the result that the consumer will often feel strangeness and unpleasant taste in the taste and flavor. In addition, the body is difficultly felt from imbalanced coffee taste and flavor. Herein, the "unpleasant taste" used in the specification refers to off-taste remaining after drinking and disrupting original taste and flavor balance of roasted coffee beans.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present invention relates to a method for producing roasted coffee beans useful as a starting material for a coffee beverage having rich body, suppressed in unpleasant taste and reduced in the amount of hydroxyhydroquinone.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The present inventor surprisingly found that roasted coffee beans useful as a starting material for a coffee beverage having rich body, suppressed in unpleasant taste and reduced in the amount of hydroxyhydroquinone are obtained by subjecting roasted coffee beans placed in an airtight container to a heat treatment at a predetermined temperature under humidified conditions.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">According to the present invention, it is possible to efficiently produce roasted coffee beans useful as a starting material for a coffee beverage having rich body, suppressed in unpleasant taste and reduced in the amount of hydroxyhydroquinone, in a simple operation.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The method for producing roasted coffee beans of the present invention includes placing starting material roasted coffee beans in an airtight container and subjecting the roasted coffee beans to a heat treatment at a temperature of from 100 to 160°C under humidified conditions.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The airtight container to be used in the present invention is not particularly limited as long as it shuts out contact with ambient air; examples thereof include a retort pouch, a can and a bottle. Note that the can and bottle are preferably openable and closable by means of a stopple or a lid. Also, the shape and material for the airtight container are not particularly limited; and a pressure-resistant container made of a material which does not change in property by heating is preferable; for example, a metal container and a glass container may be mentioned.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In the production method of the present invention, the interior of an airtight container is humidified in order to subject starting material roasted coffee beans to a heat treatment under humidified conditions.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">As a humidification method, for example, a method of humidifying by adding water to the interior of an airtight container is mentioned. More specifically, a method of placing a vessel storing water in an airtight container; a method of placing a water-absorbing material in an airtight container and adding water to the water-absorbing material; a method of placing a water-absorbing material having previously-contained water in an airtight container; and a method of adding water to starting material roasted coffee beans, can be mentioned. The water-absorbing material is not particularly limited as long as it has water absorbability and does not change in property by heating; for example, cloth, nonwoven cloth and waste paper are mentioned.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">An amount of water added, in other words, a mass ratio of water to starting material roasted coffee beans, in view of reducing the amount of hydroxyhydroquinone and enhancing body, is preferably 0.001 or more, more preferably 0.002 or more, more preferably 0.003 or more, more preferably 0.004 or more, more preferably 0.006 or more, more preferably 0.008 or more and even more preferably 0.01 or more; and, in view of taste and flavor balance and sharpness of sourness, the mass ratio is preferably 0.06 or less, more preferably 0.05 or less and even more preferably 0.04 or less. The amount of water added, i.e., the mass ratio of water to starting material roasted coffee beans, preferably is from 0.001 to 0.06, more preferably from 0.002 to 0.06, more preferably from 0.003 to 0.06, more preferably from 0.004 to 0.05, more preferably from 0.006 to 0.05, more preferably from 0.008 to 0.04 and even more preferably from 0.01 to 0.04.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Examples of kinds of starting material roasted coffee beans to be used in the present invention may include <i>Coffea</i> Arabica, <i>Coffea</i> Robusta and <i>Coffea</i> Liberica. Examples of a production region of coffee beans include, but not particularly limited to, Brazil, Colombia, Tanzania, Mocha, Kilimanjaro, Mandheling, Blue Mountain and Guatemala.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The starting material roasted coffee beans can be used singly or as a mixture of two or more. If two or more of starting material roasted coffee beans are used, coffee beans not only different in kind and production region but also different in degree of roast can be used as a mixture.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The starting material roasted coffee beans having an L value higher than a desired L value of the roasted coffee beans to be obtained by the present invention are preferably used. For example, the L value of starting material roasted coffee beans is preferably higher by 1 or more than a desired L value of the roasted coffee beans, more preferably higher by from 1 to 10. More specifically, when roasted coffee beans having an L value of about 20 are desired, starting material roasted coffee beans having an L value of from 21 to 30 are preferably used. Herein, the "L value" used in the specification is defined as a lightness value of roasted coffee beans measured by a color difference meter, provided that the L value of black is regarded as 0 and the L value of white is regarded as 100. As the color difference meter, for example, spectrophotometer SE2000 (manufactured by Nippon Denshoku Industries Co., Ltd.) can be used.</p>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The L value of starting material roasted coffee beans to be used in the present invention, in view of taste and flavor, is preferably 10 or more, more preferably 12 or more and even more preferably 14 or more; and preferably 40 or less, more preferably 38 or less and even more preferably 36 or less. The L value of starting material roasted coffee beans preferably falls within the range of from 10 to 40, more preferably from 12 to 38 and even more preferably from 14 to 36. Note that when two kinds or more of starting material roasted coffee beans different in degree of roast are used, they are appropriately used in combination such that the average L value of them falls within the above range. The average L value is determined as the sum of products, which are obtained multiplying the L value of starting material roasted coffee beans to be used by the content ratio of the starting material roasted coffee beans.</p>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The starting material roasted coffee beans may be roasted green coffee beans or commercially available product.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">A method of roasting green coffee beans is not particularly limited and a known method can be appropriately selected. For example, the roasting temperature is preferably from 180 to 300°C, more preferably from 190 to 280°C and even more preferably from 200 to 280°C. The heating time can be appropriately set so as to obtain a desired degree of roast. Furthermore, examples of roasters which may be used include a roaster for roasting beans kept unmoved, a roaster for roasting beans while transferring and a roaster for roasting beans while stirring or the like. More specifically, a shelf dryer, a conveyer dryer, a rotary-drum dryer and a rotary V-type dryer or the like are mentioned. As a heating system, a direct heating system, a hot-air system, a half-hot air system, a far-infrared ray system, an infrared ray system, a microwave system and a superheated steam system are mentioned.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The starting material roasted coffee beans may be ground or not ground; however, ground starting material roasted coffee beans are preferable in view of reactivity. The size of ground starting material roasted coffee beans can be appropriately selected; however, the roasted coffee beans which pass through a 12-mesh Tyler standard sieve and do not pass through a 115-mesh Tyler standard sieve are preferable.</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">A method for placing starting material roasted coffee beans in a container is as follows. For example, if a water-absorbing material having water added thereto is placed in an airtight container, roasted coffee beans may be placed so as to be in contact with the water-absorbing material, or may be placed in the container having a partition board such as a mesh, which is provided in order to avoid contact between a water-absorbing material and starting material roasted coffee beans.</p>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">At the time of loading starting material roasted coffee beans, when starting material roasted coffee beans are placed in an airtight container, an amount of starting material roasted coffee beans to be loaded is preferably controlled such that a predetermined spatial volume can be left in the container. For example, a ratio of starting material roasted coffee beans (mass (g)) to be placed in the container relative to the internal volume (cm<sup>3</sup>) of the airtight container is preferably 0.005 g/cm<sup>3</sup> or more, more preferably 0.01 g/cm<sup>3</sup> or more and even more preferably 0.02 g/cm<sup>3</sup> or more; and preferably 0.25 g/cm<sup>3</sup> or less, more preferably 0.13 g/cm<sup>3</sup> or less, more preferably 0.1 g/cm<sup>3</sup> or less and even more preferably less than 0.05 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.

    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024"> After starting material roasted coffee beans are placed in a container, the container is sealed. At this time, for the atmosphere in the airtight container, either atmospheric air or an inert gas atmosphere such as nitrogen may be employed.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Then, the starting material roasted coffee beans placed in the airtight container is heated.</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The heating temperature is, in view of taste and flavor and reducing the amount of hydroxyhydroquinone, preferably 100°C or more, more preferably 105°C or more, more preferably 110°C or more, more preferably 115°C or more and even more preferably 120°C or more; and preferably 160°C or less, more preferably 155°C or less, more preferably 150°C or less, more preferably 145°C or less and even more preferably 140°C or less.

Such range of the heating temperature may also be from 105 to 145°C.</p>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">When starting material roasted coffee beans are heated, taking the amount of water added into consideration, the heating temperature is preferably controlled such that water vapor partial pressure derived from water, which is added to the airtight container at a heating condition and the relative humidity therein satisfy the following values.</p>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The water vapor partial pressure in the airtight container at a heating condition is, in view of reducing the amount of hydroxyhydroquinone, preferably 10 kPa or more, more preferably 14 kPa or more, more preferably 18 kPa or more, more preferably 25 kPa or more, more preferably 40 kPa or more and even more preferably 60 kPa or more; and, in view of taste and flavor, the water vapor partial pressure is preferably 300 kPa or less, more preferably 250 kPa or less, more preferably 210 kPa or less, more preferably 200 kPa or less and even more preferably 195 kPa or less.

The increase amount of the relative humidity preferably falls within the range of from 5 to 100%, more preferably from 6 to 100%, more preferably from 7 to 100%, more preferably from 10 to 95%, more preferably from 15 to 90% and even more preferably from 20 to 85%. The term "increase amount of relative humidity" used in the specification is based on a reference relative humidity, which is obtained in the airtight container when roasted coffee beans alone are placed in the airtight container and heated at the predetermined temperature without humidifying; more specifically, it refers to an amount of increase in relative humidity in an airtight container when roasted coffee beans are placed and heated at a predetermined temperature under humidified conditions, relative to the reference relative humidity. Note that since roasted coffee beans virtually contain no water and the amount of water vapor originally contained in an airtight container is reduced to extremely low amount when it is heated to a predetermined temperature, the relative humidity in the airtight container when roasted coffee beans alone are placed in the airtight container and heated at a predetermined temperature without humidifying may be regarded as virtually 0%.</p>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The heating time is, in view of taste and flavor and reducing the amount of hydroxyhydroquinone, preferably 0.5 hours or more and even more preferably 1 hour or more; and, in view of productivity, the heating time is preferably 4 hours or less, more preferably 3 hours or less and even more preferably 2 hours or less. The heating time preferably falls within the range of from 0.5 to 4 hours, more preferably from 1 to 3 hours and even more preferably from 1 to 2 hours. The heating time herein is specified as the lapse time after an airtight container is charged into a heating apparatus in the case where the heating apparatus is previously heated to a desired temperature. Alternatively, in the case where the temperature is raised after an airtight container is charged into the heating apparatus, the heating time is specified as the lapse time after the temperature reaches to a desired temperature.</p>
    <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">As the heating apparatus, for example, an autoclave and a drier to which heat can be applied may be used.</p>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">After the heat treatment, the airtight container is taken out from the heating apparatus and preferably cooled to from 0 to 100°C and more preferably to from 10 to 60°C, within 30 minutes. After cooling, the airtight container is opened and the roasted coffee beans are taken out from the container to obtain the roasted coffee beans of the present invention.</p>
    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In the roasted coffee beans thus obtained, the hydroxyhydroquinone content is sufficiently reduced compared to that usually contained in roasted coffee beans. More specifically, the content of hydroxyhydroquinone per kg of roasted coffee beans is, in view of further suppressing unpleasant taste and enhancing body, preferably 40 mg or less, more preferably 35 mg or less, more preferably 30 mg or less and even more preferably 25 mg or less.

Thereafter, the SOT can was charged into an autoclave (HI Clave, HVA-85, Hirayama Manufacturing Corporation, hereinafter the same) and a heat treatment was performed at 125°C for one hour under pressure of 0.145 MPa in terms of a gauge pressure to obtain roasted coffee beans having an L value of 16.0.</p>
    <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Subsequently, to the obtained roasted coffee beans (0.5 g), 80 g of water for extraction (a solution of 1 g of phosphoric acid and 0.03 g of 1-hydroxyethane-1,1-diphosphonic acid (HEDPO) in 1 L of ion-exchanged water) was added, and the extraction was performed by immersing for 10 minutes while maintaining the temperature of from 95 to 99°C. The supernatant was collected to obtain a coffee extract solution. The obtained coffee extract solution (1) was subjected to componential analysis. The results are shown in Table 1.</p>
    <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Furthermore, to the roasted coffee beans (5 g), 100 g of hot water (98°C) was added. The mixture was sufficiently stirred and filtrated by a commercially available coffee filter to obtain a coffee extract solution. The obtained coffee extract solution (2) was subjected to a sensory test. The results are shown in Table 1.</p>
