  <abstract id="abstr_eng" date-changed="20150910" lang="eng" format="original">
    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">In a process for producing phenol and/or cyclohexanone, cyclohexylbenzene is contacted with an oxygen-containing gas under conditions effective to produce an oxidation effluent containing cyclohexylbenzene hydroperoxide. At least a portion of the oxidation effluent containing cyclohexylbenzene hydroperoxide is then contacted with a cleavage catalyst under conditions effective to produce a cleavage effluent containing phenol and cyclohexanone. At least one of the oxidation effluent and the cleavage effluent contains a by-product comprising a mixture of isomers of phenylcyclohexanol and/or phenylcyclohexanone, in which the 2-phenyl isomer(s) is present in an amount less than 20% of the mixture. At least a portion of the at least one effluent containing the isomer mixture is contacted with a dehydration catalyst under conditions effective to convert at least a portion of the mixture to isomers of phenylcyclohexene, with very low ring rearrangement to produce 1-methylcyclopentenylbenzene and cyclopentenylmethylbenzene.</p>

      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a process for producing phenol.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Phenol is an important product in the chemical industry and is useful in, for example, the production of phenolic resins, bisphenol A, Îµ-caprolactam, adipic acid, and plasticizers.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Currently, a common route for the production of phenol is the Hock process via cumene. This is a three-step process in which the first step involves alkylation of benzene with propylene in the presence of an acidic catalyst to produce cumene. The second step is oxidation, preferably aerobic oxidation, of the cumene to the corresponding cumene hydroperoxide. The third step is the cleavage of the cumene hydroperoxide in the presence of heterogeneous or homogenous catalysts into substantially equimolar amounts of phenol and acetone. However, the world demand for phenol is growing more rapidly than that for the acetone co-product.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Thus, a process that avoids or reduces the use of propylene as a feed and coproduces higher ketones, rather than acetone, may be an attractive alternative route to the production of phenol. For example, there is a growing market for cyclohexanone, which is used as an industrial solvent, as an activator in oxidation reactions and in the production of adipic acid, cyclohexanone resins, cyclohexanone oxime, caprolactam, and nylon 6.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">It is known that phenol and cyclohexanone can be co-produced by a variation of the Hock process in which cyclohexylbenzene is oxidized to obtain cyclohexylbenzene hydroperoxide and the hydroperoxide is decomposed in the presence of an acid catalyst to the desired phenol and cyclohexanone. Although various methods are available for the production of cyclohexylbenzene, a preferred route is via benzene hydroalkylation in which benzene is contacted with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such that a portion of the benzene is converted into cyclohexene which then reacts with the remaining benzene to produce the desired cyclohexylbenzene. One such method is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,037,513, in which the catalyst comprises a molecular sieve of the MCM-22 type and at least one hydrogenation metal selected from palladium, ruthenium, nickel, cobalt, and mixtures thereof. This reference also discloses that the resultant cyclohexylbenzene can be oxidized to the corresponding hydroperoxide, which is then decomposed to the desired phenol and cyclohexanone co-product in roughly equimolar amounts.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Several technical challenges not seen in the cumene-based Hock process exist in producing phenol via cyclohexylbenzene. One such challenge is that non-negligible amounts of by-products, including phenylcyclohexanols and phenylcyclohexanones, are generated during the oxidation step. To improve process economics, it would be desirable to develop a process for converting these phenylcyclohexanols and phenylcyclohexanones to useful products. In seeking to develop such a process, the present inventors have found that phenylcyclohexanols and phenylcyclohexanones can be converted back to cyclohexylbenzene in high yield by a combination of dehydration and hydrogenation. However, investigation of this process has also demonstrated that, particularly with the 2-phenyl isomers, such as 2-phenyl-1-cyclohexanol and 2-phenyl-1-cyclohexanone, the dehydration step is accompanied by isomerization of the 2-phenylcyclohexene intermediate to 1-methylcyclopentenylbenzene and cyclopentenylmethylbenzene. On hydrogenation, these products are converted to 1-methylcyclopentylbenzene and cyclopentylmethylbenzene, which are difficult to remove from the hydrogenation effluent by either physical or chemical techniques.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">According to the present disclosure, it has now been found that, by controlling the cyclohexylbenzene oxidation step, it is possible to maintain the total amount of 2-phenyl-1-cyclohexanol and 2-phenyl-1-cyclohexanone at a level less than 20% of all phenylcyclohexanol isomers and phenylcyclohexanone isomers. One suitable mode of control is by selecting a cyclic imide as the oxidation catalyst. In this way, dehydration and hydrogenation of the phenylcyclohexanol/phenylcyclohexanone by-product leads to negligible amounts (less than 5000 ppm) of 1-methylcyclopentenylbenzene and cyclopentenylmethylbenzene, and the yield of cyclohexylbenzene in the hydrogenation step is improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In one aspect, a first aspect of the present disclosure relates to a process for producing phenol and/or cyclohexanone, the process comprising:</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In the present disclosure, a process may be described as comprising of at least one âstep.â It should be understood that each step is an action or operation that may be carried out once or multiple times in the process, in a continuous or discontinuous fashion. Unless specified to the contrary or the context clearly indicates otherwise, each step in a process may be conducted sequentially in the order as they are listed, with or without overlapping with one or more other step, or in any other order, as the case may be. In addition, some steps may be conducted simultaneously, for example, in the same reaction zone. Preferably, steps are performed in the order listed.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers in the present disclosure are to be understood as being modified by the term âaboutâ in all instances. It should also be understood that the precise numerical values used in the specification and claims constitute specific embodiments. Efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy of the data in the examples. However, it should be understood that any measured data inherently contains a certain level of error due to the limitation of the technique and equipment used for making the measurement.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">As used herein, the indefinite article âaâ or âanâ shall mean âat least oneâ unless specified to the contrary or the context clearly indicates otherwise. Thus, embodiments using âa hydrogenating metalâ include embodiments where one, two, or more hydrogenating metals are used, unless specified to the contrary or the context clearly indicates that only one hydrogenating metal is used.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">As used herein, the term âcyclohexylbenzeneâ shall mean benzene substituted by a single cyclohexyl group, unless specified to the contrary or the context clearly indicates otherwise. As used herein, the generic term âdicyclohexylbenzeneâ shall include 1,2-dicyclohexylbenzene, 1,3-dicyclohexylbenzene, 1,4-dicyclohexylbenzene, and mixtures and combinations of at least two thereof in any proportion. As used herein, the generic term âtricyclohexylbenzeneâ shall include 1,2,3-tricyclohexylbenzene, 1,2,4-tricyclohexylbenzene and 1,3,5-tricyclohexylbenzene, and combinations and mixtures thereof at any proportion. The generic term âpolycycloyhexylbenzeneâ shall include any of the dicyclohexylbenzene isomers and tricyclohexylbenzene isomers described above, and combinations and mixtures of at least two thereof in any proportion.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">As used herein, the term âeffluentâ generally means the product of a given step or operation. Thus, the effluent can be a stream of material flowing from a vessel in a continuous process or the product from a batch or semi-batch process.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">A process is described herein for producing phenol and/or cyclohexanone from cyclohexylbenzene. In the process, cyclohexylbenzene is initially oxidized to produce cyclohexylbenzene hydroperoxide, which can then be cleaved to generate the desired phenol and cyclohexanone. However, the oxidation step also produces by-products, including isomers of phenylcyclohexanol and phenylcyclohexanone, which in the present process are dehydrated to phenylcyclohexene which can then be hydrogenated back to cyclohexylbenzene for recycle to the oxidation step. By controlling the oxidation reaction so that the amount of the 2-phenyl isomers in the mixture of phenylcyclohexanol and phenylcyclohexanone isomers present in the oxidation product is maintained below 20 wt % of the mixture, it is found that the dehydration step to phenylcyclohexene is accompanied by little or no ring rearrangement to 1-methylcyclopentenylbenzene and cyclopentenylmethylbenzene.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Preferably, the process of the present disclosure forms part of an integrated process for producing phenol from benzene in which the benzene is initially alkylated or hydroalkylated to produce the cyclohexylbenzene feed to the present process. The ensuing description will therefore focus on this integrated process.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Production of Cyclohexylbenzene</heading>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The cyclohexylbenzene starting material for the present process can be produced by the alkylation of benzene with cyclohexene according to the following reaction:</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0000">
        <chemistry id="chem-00001-en" num="00001">
          <img id="img-00001-en" he="11.60mm" wi="71.80mm" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" file="US20150251997A1_00002.PNG" img-format="png" original="US20150251997A1-20150910-C00001.TIF" />
        </chemistry>
      </p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0038">The cyclohexene can be supplied to the reaction zone as a separate feed from the benzene, but normally is produced in situ by the selective hydrogenation of benzene in the presence of a bifunctional catalyst. Such a reaction is generally termed âhydroalkylationâ and may be summarized as follows:</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0000">
        <chemistry id="chem-00002-en" num="00002">
          <img id="img-00002-en" he="11.60mm" wi="66.12mm" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" file="US20150251997A1_00003.PNG" img-format="png" original="US20150251997A1-20150910-C00002.TIF" />
        </chemistry>
      </p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0039">Any commercially available benzene feed can be used in the hydroalkylation step, but preferably the benzene has a purity level of at least 99 wt %. Similarly, although the source of hydrogen is not critical, it is desirable that the hydrogen is at least 99 wt % pure.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0040">The total feed to the hydroalkylation step may contain less than 1000 ppm, such as less than 500 ppm, for example less than 100 ppm, water. In addition, the total feed may contain less than 100 ppm, such as less than 30 ppm, for example less than 3 ppm, sulfur and less than 10 ppm, such as less than 1 ppm, for example less than 0.1 ppm, nitrogen.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0041">Hydrogen can be supplied to the hydroalkylation step over a wide range of values, but is desirably arranged such that the molar ratio of hydrogen to benzene in the hydroalkylation feed is from about 0.15:1 to about 15:1, such as from about 0.4:1 to about 4:1, for example from about 0.4:1 to about 0.9:1.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0042">In addition to the benzene and hydrogen, a diluent, which is substantially inert under hydroalkylation conditions, may be supplied to the hydroalkylation reaction. The diluent may be a hydrocarbon, in which the desired cycloalkylaromatic product, in this case cyclohexylbenzene, is soluble, such as a straight chain paraffinic hydrocarbon, a branched chain paraffinic hydrocarbon, and/or a cyclic paraffinic hydrocarbon. Examples of suitable diluents are decane and cyclohexane. Cyclohexane is a particularly attractive diluent since it is an unwanted by-product of the hydroalkylation reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0043">Although the amount of diluent is not narrowly defined, advantageously the diluent is added in an amount such that the weight ratio of the diluent to the aromatic compound is at least 1:100; for example at least 1:10, but no more than 10:1, for example no more than 4:1.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0044">The hydroalkylation reaction can be conducted in a wide range of reactor configurations including fixed bed, slurry reactors, and/or catalytic distillation towers. In addition, the hydroalkylation reaction can be conducted in a single reaction zone or in a plurality of reaction zones, in which at least the hydrogen is introduced to the reaction in stages. Suitable reaction temperatures are from about 100Â° C. to about 400Â° C., such as from about 125Â° C. to about 250Â° C., while suitable reaction pressures are from about 100 kPa to about 7,000 kPa, such as from about 500 kPa to about 5,000 kPa.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0045">The catalyst employed in the hydroalkylation reaction is a bifunctional catalyst comprising a hydrogenating metal component and an alkylating solid acid component. Advantageously, the alkylating solid acid component comprises a molecular sieve of the MCM-22 type. The term âMCM-22 type materialâ (or âmaterial of the MCM-22 typeâ or âmolecular sieve of the MCM-22 typeâ), as used herein, includes one or more of: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>molecular sieves made from a common first degree crystalline building block unit cell, which unit cell has the MWW framework topology. (A unit cell is a spatial arrangement of atoms which if tiled in three-dimensional space describes the crystal structure. Such crystal structures are discussed in the âAtlas of Zeolite Framework Typesâ, Fifth Edition, 2001, the entire content of which is incorporated as reference);</li><li>molecular sieves made from a common second degree building block, being a 2-dimensional tiling of such MWW framework topology unit cells, forming a monolayer of one unit cell thickness, preferably one c-unit cell thickness;</li><li>molecular sieves made from common second degree building blocks, being layers of one or more than one unit cell thickness, wherein the layer of more than one unit cell thickness is made from stacking, packing, or binding at least two monolayers of one unit cell thickness. The stacking of such second degree building blocks can be in a regular fashion, an irregular fashion, a random fashion, or any combination thereof; and</li><li>molecular sieves made by any regular or random 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional combination of unit cells having the MWW framework topology.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0050">Molecular sieves of MCM-22 type generally have an X-ray diffraction pattern including d-spacing maxima at 12.4Â±0.25, 6.9Â±0.15, 3.57Â±0.07, and 3.42Â±0.07 Angstrom. The X-ray diffraction data used to characterize the material are obtained by standard techniques using the K-alpha doublet of copper as the incident radiation and a diffractometer equipped with a scintillation counter and associated computer as the collection system. Molecular sieves of MCM-22 type include MCM-22 (described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,954,325), PSH-3 (described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,409), SSZ-25 (described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,667), ERB-1 (described in European Patent No. 0293032), ITQ-1 (described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,077,498), ITQ-2 (described in International Patent Publication No. WO97/17290), MCM-36 (described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,250,277), MCM-49 (described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,236,575), MCM-56 (described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,697), and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the molecular sieve is selected from (a) MCM-49; (b) MCM-56; and (c) isotypes of MCM-49 and MCM-56, such as ITQ-2. Other molecular sieves, such as UZM-8 (described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,756,030) may be used alone or along with the MCM-22 type molecular sieves for the hydroalkylation reaction described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0051">Any known hydrogenating metal can be employed in the hydroalkylation catalyst, although suitable metals include palladium, ruthenium, nickel, zinc, tin, and cobalt, with palladium being particularly advantageous. Desirably, the amount of hydrogenating metal present in the catalyst is from about 0.05 wt % to about 10 wt %, such as from about 0.1 wt % to about 5.0 wt %, of the catalyst. Where the MCM-22 type molecular sieve is an aluminosilicate, the amount of hydrogenating metal present can be such that the molar ratio of the aluminum in the molecular sieve to the hydrogenating metal is from about 1.5 to about 1500, for example from about 75 to about 750, such as from about 100 to about 300.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0052">The hydrogenating metal may be directly supported on the MCM-22 type molecular sieve by, for example, impregnation or ion exchange. Preferably, at least 50 wt %, for example at least 75 wt %, and desirably substantially all of the hydrogenating metal is supported on an inorganic oxide separate from, but composited with, the molecular sieve. In particular, it is found that by supporting the hydrogenating metal on the inorganic oxide, the activity of the catalyst and its selectivity to cyclohexylbenzene and dicyclohexylbenzene are increased as compared with an equivalent catalyst in which the hydrogenating metal is supported on the molecular sieve.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0053">The inorganic oxide employed in such a composite hydroalkylation catalyst is not narrowly defined provided it is stable and inert under the conditions of the hydroalkylation reaction. Suitable inorganic oxides include oxides of Groups 2, 4, 13, and 14 of the Periodic Table of Elements, such as alumina, titania, and/or zirconia. As used herein, the numbering scheme for the Periodic Table Groups is as disclosed in Chemical and Engineering News, 63(5), 27 (1985).</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0054">The hydrogenating metal is deposited on the inorganic oxide by, e.g., impregnation, before the metal-containing inorganic oxide is composited with the molecular sieve. The catalyst composite may be produced by co-pelletization, in which a mixture of the molecular sieve and the metal-containing inorganic oxide are formed into pellets at high pressure (desirably about 350 kPa to about 350,000 kPa), or by co-extrusion, in which a slurry of the molecular sieve and the metal-containing inorganic oxide, optionally together with a separate binder, are forced through a die. If necessary, additional hydrogenating metal can subsequently be deposited on the resultant catalyst composite.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0055">Although the hydroalkylation reaction using an MCM-22 type molecular sieve catalyst is highly selective towards cyclohexylbenzene, the effluent from the hydroalkylation reaction will inevitably contain some dicyclohexylbenzene by-product. Depending on the amount of this dicyclohexylbenzene, it may be desirable to either (a) transalkylate the dicyclohexylbenzene with additional benzene or (b) dealkylate the dicyclohexylbenzene to maximize the production of the desired monoalkylated species.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0056">Transalkylation with additional benzene is desirably effected in a transalkylation reactor, separate from the hydroalkylation reactor, over a suitable transalkylation catalyst, such as a molecular sieve of the MCM-22 type, zeolite beta, MCM-68 (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,014,018), zeolite Y, and mordenite. The transalkylation reaction is desirably conducted under at least partial liquid phase conditions, which suitably include a temperature of about 100Â° C. to about 300Â° C., a pressure of about 800 kPa to about 3500 kPa, a weight hourly space velocity of about 1 hr<sup>â1 </sup>to about 10 hr<sup>â1 </sup>on total feed, and a benzene/dicyclohexylbenzene weight ratio about of 1:1 to about 5:1.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0057">Dealkylation or cracking is also desirably effected in a reactor separate from the hydroalkylation reactor, such as a reactive distillation unit, at a temperature of about 150Â° C. to about 500Â° C. and a pressure of 15 psig to 500 psig (200 kPa to 3550 kPa) over an acid catalyst such as an aluminosilicate, an aluminophosphate, a silicoaluminophosphate, amorphous silica-alumina, an acidic clay, a mixed metal oxide, such as WO<sub>x</sub>/ZrO<sub>2</sub>, phosphoric acid, sulfated zirconia and mixtures thereof. Desirably, the acid catalyst includes at least one aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate of the FAU, AEL, AFI, and MWW type. Unlike transalkylation, dealkylation can be conducted in the absence of added benzene, although it may be desirable to add benzene to the dealkylation reaction to reduce coke formation. In this case, the weight ratio of benzene to poly-alkylated aromatic compounds in the feed to the dealkylation reaction is desirably from 0 to about 0.9, such as from about 0.01 to about 0.5. Similarly, although the dealkylation reaction can be conducted in the absence of added hydrogen, hydrogen is advantageously introduced into the dealkylation reactor to assist in coke reduction. Suitable hydrogen addition rates are such that the molar ratio of hydrogen to poly-alkylated aromatic compound in the total feed to the dealkylation reactor is from about 0.01 to about 10.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0058">Another significant by-product of the hydroalkylation reaction is cyclohexane. Although a C<sub>6</sub>-rich stream comprising cyclohexane and unreacted benzene can be readily removed from the hydroalkylation reaction effluent by distillation, owing to the similarity in the boiling points of benzene and cyclohexane, the C<sub>6</sub>-rich stream is difficult to further separate by simple distillation. However, some or all of the C<sub>6</sub>-rich stream can be recycled to the hydroalkylation reactor to provide not only part of the benzene feed but also part of the diluents mentioned above.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0059">In some cases, it may be desirable to supply some of the C<sub>6</sub>-rich stream to a dehydrogenation reaction zone, where the C<sub>6</sub>-rich stream is contacted with a dehydrogenation catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions sufficient to convert at least a portion of the cyclohexane in the C<sub>6</sub>-rich stream portion to benzene, which again can be recycled to the hydroalkylation reaction. The dehydrogenation catalyst desirably comprises (a) a support; (b) a hydrogenation-dehydrogenation component; and (c) an inorganic promoter. The support (a) may be selected from the group consisting of silica, a silicate, an aluminosilicate, zirconia, and carbon nanotubes, and preferably comprises silica. Suitable hydrogenation-dehydrogenation components (b) comprise at least one metal selected from Groups 6 to 10 of the Periodic Table of Elements, such as platinum, palladium and compounds, and mixtures thereof. Desirably, the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation component is present in an amount from about 0.1 wt % to about 10 wt % of the catalyst. A suitable inorganic promoter (c) comprises at least one metal or compound thereof selected from Group 1 of the Periodic Table of Elements, such as a potassium compound. Desirably, the promoter is present in an amount from about 0.1 wt % to about 5.0 wt % of the catalyst. Suitable dehydrogenation conditions include a temperature of about 250Â° C. to about 500Â° C., a pressure of about atmospheric to about 500 psig (100 kPa to 3550 kPa), a weight hourly space velocity of about 0.2 hr<sup>â1 </sup>to 50 hr<sup>â1</sup>, and a hydrogen to hydrocarbon feed molar ratio of about 0 to about 20.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0060">Other disadvantageous impurities of the hydroalkylation reaction are bicyclohexyl (BCH) and the methylcyclopentylbenzene (MCPB) isomers which, because of the similarity in their boiling points, are difficult to separate from the desired cyclohexylbenzene by distillation. Moreover, although 1,2-methylcyclopentylbenzene (2-MCPB), and 1,3-methylcyclopentylbenzene (3-MCPB) are readily converted in the subsequent oxidation/cleavage steps to the phenol and methylcyclopentanones, which are valuable products, 1,1-methylcyclopentylbenzene (1-MCPB) is substantially inert to the oxidation step and so, if not removed, will build up in the C<sub>12 </sub>stream. Similarly, bicyclohexyl (BCH) can lead to separation problems downstream. Thus, at least a portion of the hydroalkylation reaction product may be treated with a catalyst under conditions to remove at least 1,1-methylcyclopentylbenzene and/or bicyclohexyl from the product. The catalyst can be an acid catalyst, such as an aluminosilicate zeolite, and especially faujasite and the treatment is conducted at a temperature of about 100Â° C. to about 350Â° C., such as about 130Â° C. to about 250Â° C., for a time of about 0.1 to about 3 hours, such as about 0.1 to about 1 hours. The catalytic treatment is believed to isomerize the 1,1-methylcyclopentylbenzene to the more readily oxidizable 1,2-methylcyclopentylbenzene (2-MCPB), and 1,3-methylcyclopentylbenzene (3-MCPB). The bicyclohexyl is believed to react with benzene present in the hydroalkylation reaction product to produce cyclohexane and more of the desired cyclohexylbenzene according to the following reaction:</p>

The oxidation reactor may have means to withdraw and pump a portion of its contents through a suitable cooling device and return the cooled portion to the reactor, thereby managing the exothermicity of the oxidation reaction. Alternatively, cooling coils providing indirect cooling, say by cooling water, may be operated within the oxidation reactor to remove the generated heat. Alternatively, the oxidation reactor may comprise a plurality of reactors in series, each conducting a portion of the oxidation reaction, optionally operating at different conditions selected to enhance the oxidation reaction at the pertinent conversion range of cyclohexylbenzene or oxygen, or both, in each.

The effluent from cleavage reaction may contain residual sulfuric acid cleavage catalyst in addition to the phenol and cyclohexanone products and the phenylcyclohexanol and/or phenylcyclohexanone by-products. In this case, the residual sulfuric acid in the cleavage reaction effluent may be first neutralized by treating the cleavage effluent with one or more amines or diamines to produce amine salts. The amine salts are then removed from the neutralized cleavage effluent, desirably by an initial distillation step, with the amine salts being removed as part of the heavies.

The phenylcyclohexenes (formula (F-IX), (F-X) and (F-XI) above) are thereby converted to cyclohexylbenzene, which can then be recycled to the oxidation stage to enhance the yield of phenol and cyclohexanone. On the other hand, 1-methylcyclopentenylbenzene (formula (F-XII) above) and cyclopentenylmethylbenzene (formula (F-XIII) above), if present in the feed in the hydrogenation zone, will be converted into 1-methylcyclopentylbenzene and cyclopentylmethylbenzene, respectively, causing loss of overall cyclohexylbenzene yield in the process.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0085">The dehydration and hydrogenation reactions can be conducted sequentially in separate reactors or in stacked beds in the same reactor. Alternatively, the dehydration and hydrogenation reactions can be conducted in the same reaction zone by employing a bifunctional catalyst comprising the solid acid component and the hydrogenating metal component described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0086">It may be desirable to take a vapor or liquid side draw from either the distillation column used to remove the amine salts or from the distillation column used to separate the phenylcyclohexanol and/or phenylcyclohexanone by-products and employ this side draw as a feed to the dehydration/hydrogenation reactor. This would also allow integration of the distillation columns with the dehydration/hydrogenation reactor such that the effluent from the reactor could be fed back into the distillation column(s) to remove impurities produced in the dehydration/hydrogenation reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0087">The invention will now be more particularly described with reference to the following non-limiting example.</p>
