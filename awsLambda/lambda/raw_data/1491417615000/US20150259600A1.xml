    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">There is provided a liquid crystal composition which enables a significant reduction in crystallization temperature as compared with addition of a homologue while having a similar skeleton structure, which has an excellent compatibility, and which enables an increase in the absolute value of negative dielectric anisotropy (ÎÎµ). The liquid crystal composition contains two or more compounds which each have two to four ring structures between two side chains. At least one of the ring structures is a 2,3-difluorobenzene skeleton. The two side chains are bonded to different ring structures.

      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a liquid crystal composition.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Ferroelectric liquid crystal (PLC) exhibits ferroelectricity through spontaneous polarization. It is known that liquid crystal having a permanent dipole moment in a direction vertical to the direction of the molecular long axis has a layered structure in a smectic phase, that the permanent dipole moment is not cancelled in a shift to a chiral smectic C (hereinafter referred to as SmC*) phase, in which the molecular long axis in this layered structure is tilted, even though it is averaged as a whole, and that spontaneous polarization is therefore generated with the result that the liquid crystal exhibits ferroelectricity. Application of voltage to the ferroelectric liquid crystal causes the permanent dipole moment to he oriented in the direction of the electric field and simultaneously causes the whole molecules to be aligned. The ferroelectric liquid crystal in an SmC* phase has been widely used in displays. Ferroelectric liquid crystal imparts optical activity (chirality) to smectic liquid crystal itself, such as p-decyloxybenzylidene pâ²-amino 2-methylbutyl cinnamate (DOBAMBC) of which the molecular design and synthesis were made by R. B., Meyer et al. in 1975. Even in the case where an optically active compound itself does not have liquid crystalline properties (not a liquid crystal compound), addition of the optically active compound enables generation of an SmC* phase. In such a case, a liquid crystal matrix exhibiting a non-chiral smectic C (hereinafter referred to as SmC) phase is generally used.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Among smectic phases having layered structures, in the SmC* phase, the direction of the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules has a certain tilt with respect to the layer normal. In addition, the individual layers have slight difference in the tilt angle from a layer plane (direction angle), which produces a helical structure in the molecular alignment.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Display devices using ferroelectric liquid crystal have a response speed which is at least 10 times larger than that of display devices using nematic liquid crystal. The first ferroelectric liquid crystal applied to displays is surface-stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal (SSFLC) made by Clark and Lagerwall. Ferroelectric liquid crystal has been intensively studied since this application. Besides ferroelectric liquid crystal, for instance, nematic liquid crystal is known, such as FLC (ferroelectric liquid crystal), a TM (twisted nematic) type, an STN (super twisted nematic) type, a DS (dynamic light scattering) type, a GH (guest-host) type, an IPS (in-plane switching) type, an OCB (optically compensated birefringence) type, an OCB (electrically controlled birefringence) type, a VA (vertical alignment) type, or a CSH (color super homeotropic) type.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In general, it is known that phenylpyrimidine readily exhibits a chiral smectic C phase, and phenylpyrimidine is therefore widely used in a ferroelectric liquid crystal composition. The composition containing phenylpyrimidine, however, has a problem in obtaining sufficiently high specific resistance, whereas a liquid crystal material having a high specific resistance is necessary for driving by a TFT when a ferroelectric liquid crystal composition is used, as in the case of using a nematic liquid crystal; thus, screen burn-in and flicker ate likely to be caused, which has been problematic in terms of a reduction in the reliability of LCDs. In order to produce a highly reliable LCD driven by a TFT, a nematic liquid crystal material to which a fluorine substituent has been introduced and which has a high specific resistance is widely used because it is useful for, for example, liquid crystal television sets. In regard to a smectic liquid crystal having a fluorine substituent, there has been a report in which 2,3-difluoro-1,4-phenylene derivatives and terphenyls exhibit a smectic C phase (see Hon Patent Literatures 1 and 2). In particular, 2,3-difluoro-4-alkyloxy-4â²-trans-4-alkylcyclohexyl ethyl)biphenyl does not exhibit a smectic C phase but has a high melting point (see Non Patent Literature 3).</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">A mixture of a variety of liquid crystal compounds containing highly linear liquid crystal molecules, such as 2,3-difluoro-1,4-phenylene derivatives and terphenyls, is used as a liquid crystal composition (e.g., see Patent Literature 1). Among such compounds, 2,3-difluoro-biphenyl derivatives have a problem in which birefringence În is high.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Almost all of known 2,3-difluoro-1,4-phenylene derivatives are, however, compounds having ring structures that are a trans-1,4-cyclohexylene group and a 1,4-phenylene group; unfortunately, such derivatives have a disadvantage in which they do not always have good compatibility with other liquid crystal compounds. It is therefore difficult to prepare a liquid crystal composition having a broad temperature range, particularly a liquid crystal composition which is less likely to suffer from crystal precipitation and phase separation even after being stored at low temperature for a long time; hence, there has been a need in which the melting point of a composition is decreased through an increase in solubility due to mixing of a number of various compounds with, for instance, a homologue (homologue having a difference only in the number of the carbon atoms of a side-chain alkyl group).</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">A liquid crystal compound has been studied as another technique that is different from the use of a homologue; the compound has enhanced properties specific to an n-type liquid crystal and enables expansion of the temperature range of a composition by introduction of a new skeleton structure different from a 2,3-difluoro-1,4-phenylene skeleton, such as a fluorine-substituted naphthalene structure or a tetrahydronaphthalene structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The addition of such a compound having a new skeleton structure, however, is highly restrictive in terms of, for example, compatibility with other liquid crystal compounds and effects on the physical properties and electro-optical properties of a liquid crystal composition, which has been problematic.</p>

In addition, it is necessary to polymerize the monomer into a network shape or a dispersed state in a liquid crystal phase such as a nematic phase or a smectic phase. Furthermore, in order to prevent the formation of a phase separation structure, it is preferred that the amount of a monomer be reduced for adjustment of the amount and composition of a polymer precursor so that a network polymer is formed among liquid crystal molecules in a state in which the liquid crystal molecules are aligned. In photopolymerization, it is preferred that UV exposure time, UV exposure intensity, and temperature be adjusted for formation of a network polymer, thereby eliminating defective alignment of liquid crystal molecules.</p>

The distance between the two polymerizable functional groups can be adjusted by an independent change in the carbon chain length of each of A<sup>12</sup>, A<sup>18</sup>, and A<sup>15</sup>. The compound represented by General Formula (V-c) is characterized in that the distance between polymerizable functional groups (distance between crosslinking points) is long; however, an excessive distance therebetween makes the polymerization rate extremely slow and results in an adverse effect on phase separation, and the distance between polymerizable functional groups therefore has an upper limit. The distance between two side chains A<sup>13 </sup>and A<sup>16 </sup>has an effect on the mobility of the main chain. In particular, a small distance between, the side chains A<sup>13 </sup>and A<sup>16 </sup>causes the interference between A<sup>13 </sup>and A<sup>16</sup>, which results in a reduction in the mobility. Accordingly, the distance between polymerizable functional, groups in the compound represented by General Formula (V-c) is determined by the sum total of the lengths of A<sup>12</sup>, A<sup>18</sup>, and A<sup>15</sup>; and it is preferred that the length of A<sup>15 </sup>be increased rather than those of A<sup>12 </sup>and A<sup>18</sup>.</p>

Similarly, in the case where A<sup>16 </sup>and A<sup>17 </sup>have different lengths, the side chain having a longer length is referred to as A<sup>16 </sup>(if A<sup>16 </sup>and A<sup>17 </sup>have the same length, any one of them can be referred to as A<sup>16</sup>).</p>

In the case where the side chains A<sup>14 </sup>and A<sup>17 </sup>are alkyl chains each having a short length, it is believed that they can have high mobility and inhibit an approach between adjacent main-chain moieties and that they can prevent interference between polymer main-chain moieties with the result that the mobility of the main chain is enhanced, which can prevent an increase in anchoring energy at law temperature and is effective for improving the display properties of a polymer-stabilized liquid crystal display device in a low temperature region.</p>

      <p id="p-00305-en" num="0267">For the purpose of low-voltage driving, an electrode having, for example, an IPS (in-plane switching) or FFS electrode structure can be provided to each of a pair of substrates, a confined geometry (Lee, S.-D.; <i>IDW'</i>09-<i>Proceeding of the </i>16<i>th International Display Workshots </i>1, 2009; pp. 111-112) that is a device which has a protruding electrode inside a cell and in which the distribution of electric field Intensity is less likely to be reduced inside the cell can be used, or an FFS (fringe-field switching) electrode can be provided to each of a pair of substrates.</p>
      <p id="p-00306-en" num="0268">Since an alignment state in an off-mode is similar to vertical uniaxial alignment employed in a nematic liquid crystal display device of a VA mode, an optical compensation film such as an A-plate used in a VA mode, a uniaxially stretched negative C-plate, or a biaxially stretched Z-plate can be used for improvements of contrast and a viewing angle.</p>
      <p id="p-00307-en" num="0269">In homogeneous alignment, surface-stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal (SSFLC) can be used in a display mode. In SSFLC, liquid crystal molecules are preferably aligned with the aid of a substrate subjected to a horizontal alignment treatment such that the layer normal is parallel to the surface of a substrate of a cell (homogeneous alignment); in addition, the helix in a chiral smectic C phase is preferably adjusted to be unwound owing to an effect brought about by a reduction in the thickness of a liquid crystal layer. The pitch in a chiral smectic C phase is preferably adjusted to be at least greater than or equal to the cell thickness such that the helix is unwound in a cell thickness ranging from 1.4 Î¼m to 3 Î¼m. Such adjustment for the unwinding of the helix enables liquid crystal molecules to be less likely to be tilted to the surface of a substrate, and the range of a direction angle can be restricted to be in two types, so that black-and-white binary display is enabled. It is important to select an alignment film which has a memory as a result of generation of memory (bistability) of alignment due to an effect of surface stabilization.</p>
      <p id="p-00308-en" num="0270">In order to fill the space between the substrates with liquid crystal without the occurrence of defective alignment, known vacuum injection, liquid crystal drop injection (one drop fill), or flexographic printing can be employed; it is preferred that an isotropic phase or a nematic phase be formed by heating and that phase transition be at least performed from the nematic phase to a smectic phase by slow cooling; it is preferred that the phase sequence of the liquid crystal composition be at least, from the high temperature side, an isotropic phase, a chiral nematic phase, a smectic A phase, and a chiral smectic C phase (ISO-N*-SmA-SmC*); and it is also preferred that the phase sequence be at least, from the high temperature side, an isotropic phase, a chiral nematic phase, and a chiral smectic C phase (ISO-N*-SmC*). In such a case, another phase such as a blue phase (BP) may be generated on the higher temperature side than the nematic phase; and examples of the phase sequence include a sequence of isotropic liquid, a blue phase, a chiral nematic phase, a smectic A phase, and a chiral smectic C-phase and a sequence of isotropic liquid, a blue phase, a chiral nematic phase, and a chiral smectic C-phase. In addition, liquid crystal which generates phase sequence of isotropic liquid and a chiral smectic C-phase (ISO-SmC*) can be also employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00309-en" num="0271">In order to increase the tilt angle of a liquid crystal compound, the phase sequence is preferably free from a smectic A phase, and specific examples thereof include INC (ISO-N*-SmC*) and IC (ISO-SmC*).</p>
      <p id="p-00310-en" num="0272">In the phase sequence of the liquid crystal composition, the helical pitch of a chiral nematic phase is preferably not less than 50 Î¼m at a temperature of phase transition from a chiral nematic phase to a smectic A phase or a chiral smectic C-phase in a decrease in temperature or at a temperature higher than the lower limit temperature of the chiral nematic phase by 2Â° C. in this case, since the helical pitch is sufficiently larger than the cell thickness (gap) when the liquid crystal is in a chiral nematic phase, a helical structure is not formed in the chiral nematic phase, which can give good homeotropic alignment without the occurrence of defective alignment before transition to a smectic phase; thus, further uniform alignment can be produced. In order to unwind the helical pitch in a chiral nematic phase for transition to a smectic phase, the temperature range is preferably not less than 10Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00311-en" num="0273">A narrow temperature range results in transition to a smectic phase without unwinding of the helix in some cases, which causes defective alignment. In order to unwind the helix in a chiral nematic phase, a pitch canceller having a reverse helix can be added to adjust the helix.</p>
      <p id="p-00312-en" num="0274">The liquid crystal display device may have any light source, and an LSD Is preferred because it consumes low energy. In order to further reduce power consumption, it is preferred to use flash controlling (technique of reducing light quantity or turning off light at a dark place), a multi-field driving method (technique of distinguishing driving frequency in moving picture display from that in still picture display), a technique of changing light quantity modes between indoors and outdoors or between night and day, or a technique of temporarily stopping driving by using the memory of a liquid crystal display device. A reflective display device is preferred because it can utilize exterior light sources (e.g., sunlight and indoor light) even when the apparatus does not have a light source.</p>
      <p id="p-00313-en" num="0275">The liquid crystal display device can also perform three-dimensional display by, for example, time division such as a field sequential system space division such as a polarization system, parallax barrier system, or integral imaging system; wavelength division such as a spectral system or anaglyph; or an FPS mode.</p>
      <p id="p-00314-en" num="0276">The contrast is preferably improved by flash controlling (technique of reducing light quantity or turning off light at a dark place), a device having an aperture ratio of not less than 50%, use of an alignment film which enables good alignment or use of an antiglare film, or use of a field sequential system (color-displaying system in which LEDS of RBG three colors are each sequentially lightened without use of color filters for a short time less than or equal to the temporal resolution of the human eyes for recognition of a color).</p>
      <p id="p-00315-en" num="0277">For a rapid response, it is preferred to use an over drive function (allowing the voltage for expressing a tone to be high at the time of rising and to be low at the time of falling) or to use smectic liquid crystal having negative dielectric anisotropy.</p>
      <p id="p-00316-en" num="0278">A film covering the surface of a touch panel preferably has a water and oil repellencies, antifouling properties, and fingerprint resistance in order to inhibit a decrease in display quality by being fouled. At least the electrode substrate on the pressed side is preferably a flexible substrate such as a plastic substrate or thin glass substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00317-en" num="0279">The electrode is preferably made of graphene (a sheet consisting of carbon monoatomic layer) or an organic semiconductor.</p>
      <p id="p-00318-en" num="0280">Two substrates used in a liquid crystal ceil can be made of a transparent material having flexibility, such as glass or a plastic material, and one of these substrates may be made of a non-transparent material such as silicon. The transparent substrate having a transparent electrode layer can be formed by, for example, sputtering of indium tin oxide (ITO) on a transparent plate such as a glass plate.</p>
      <p id="p-00319-en" num="0281">Color filters can be produced by, for instance, a pigment dispersion technique, a printing technique, an electrodeposition technique, or a staining technique. In production of the color filters by, for example, a pigment dispersion technique, a curable colored composition for a color filter is applied onto the transparent substrate, subjected to patterning, and then cured by being heated or irradiated with light. This process is carried out for each of three colors of red, green, and blue, thereby being able to produce the pixels of the color filters. Active elements such as a thin film transistor (TFT) using an organic semiconductor, an inorganic semiconductor, or an oxide semiconductor; a thin-film diode; a metal insulator; and a metal specific resistance element also may be provided on the resulting substrate to form the pixel electrodes.</p>
      <p id="p-00320-en" num="0282">The liquid crystal composition may be subjected to removal of impurities for an enhancement in reliability or for TFT driving or may be subjected to purification with, for instance, silica or alumina fox a further increase in specific resistance. The specific resistance of a liquid crystal composition for TFT driving is preferably not less than 10<sup>11 </sup>Î©Â·cm, more preferably not less than 10<sup>12 </sup>Î©Â·cm, and further preferably not less than 10<sup>18 </sup>Î©Â·cm. In order to prevent the effect of cations which are present as impurities in a liquid crystal composition, a cationic inclusion compound such as podand, coronand, or cryptand may be used. In TFT driving, image information is recorded at a certain time interval, and a charge is maintained between electrodes during this time to display an image. Since switching operation reduces the charge maintained between the electrodes owing to the effect of polarization reversal current caused by spontaneous polarization, an auxiliary capacitor is preferably connected to the pixel. An auxiliary capacitor that is suitable for spontaneous depolarization of liquid crystal used can be connected.</p>
      <p id="p-00321-en" num="0283">In order to maintain the performance of the liquid crystal display device even under low temperature environment, the liquid crystal composition preferably has a low-temperature storage stability. The low-temperature storage stability of the liquid crystal composition preferably enables SmC* to be maintained at 0Â° C. or less for at least 24 hours, more preferably at â20Â° C. or less for at least 500 hours, and farther preferably at â30Â° C. or less for at least 700 hours.</p>

      <p id="p-00323-en" num="0285">The liquid-crystal-supporting surfaces of substrates can be each provided with an alignment film. The alignment film can be a general alignment film, such as a polyimide film, or a photo-alignment film.</p>
      <p id="p-00324-en" num="0286">The alignment film is preferably a vertical alignment film.</p>
      <p id="p-00325-en" num="0287">The alignment film is preferably a polyimide vertical alignment film, and specific examples thereof include polyamic acids prepared by reaction of acid anhydride having a substituted long alkyl chain or alicyciic group and diamine having a substituted long alkyl chain or alicyciic group with acid dianhydride and polyimides prepared by dehydration and decyclization of such polyamic acids. A liquid crystal aligning agent composed of such polyimide, polyamide, or polyamic acid having a bulky group can be used to form a film on a substrate, thereby producing liquid crystal alignment film having vertical alignment properties.</p>
