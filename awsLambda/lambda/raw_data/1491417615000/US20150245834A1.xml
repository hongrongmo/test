      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to surgical instruments having one or more articulation portions. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a mechanism for locking the articulating portion of the surgical instrument in a plurality positions.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Background of Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Various instruments have been modified for use in closed procedures, i.e., laparoscopic, arthroscopic, endoscopic. Such instruments typically include an elongated body portion configure to extend through an opening in a patient, i.e., through an access port, and/or thorough a natural orifice, e.g., anus, mouth.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Many of these instruments adapted for use in closed procedures include an articulable tool assembly mounted on a distal end of an elongated body portion. The tool assembly is controlled remotely from the handle assembly mounted on the proximal end of the elongated body portion. An articulation mechanism mounted on the handle assembly allows for the remote articulation of the tool assembly relative to the elongated body portion. Generally, the articulation mechanism includes a lever mounted on the handle assembly that, when turned, advances or retracts an articulation linkage. The articulation link extends through the elongated body portion and is operably connected to the tool assembly. Longitudinal advancement and retraction of the articulation linkage causes articulation of the tool assembly. The tool assembly is maintained in a desired position solely through the friction between the lever and the handle. In this manner, if a clinician were to accidentally contact the tool assembly with a structure within the body with sufficient force, the force could cause the tool assembly to be deflected from the desired position.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Therefore, it would be beneficial to have an articulation mechanism configured to selectively lock the tool assembly in one or more position.</p>

      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Accordingly, a surgical instrument including a locking articulation mechanism is provided.</p>

In this configuration, locking tab <b>156</b> of lug member <b>150</b> is selectively received within central notch <b>135</b><i>a </i>of locking member <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Articulation mechanism <b>100</b> may be configured to interact with one or more computer and/or electronic components of an operating room system, or such components can be provided in the surgical device. This includes but is not limited to a sensor mechanism (not shown) of surgical device <b>10</b>. In this manner, surgical device <b>10</b> includes a structure extending through elongated shaft <b>30</b> which includes a tubular or other shaped member (not shown) that is displaced upon the engagement with the distal end of the elongated body <b>30</b> by a replaceable loading unit that has an articulatable tool assembly (not shown). Loading units with tool assemblies that do not articulate do not displace the tubular member. A sensor cap (not shown) is arranged with the tubular member so as to be displaced. The sensor cap has a portion, such as a protrusion (not shown) that is received in slot <b>113</b><i>a </i>of main shaft <b>110</b> to prevent movement of main shaft <b>110</b> unless and until the sensor cap is displaced. In this way, articulation mechanism <b>100</b> may not be moved unless an articulable tool assembly is engaged with elongated body <b>30</b> of surgical device <b>10</b>. Slot <b>113</b><i>a </i>is utilized to lock articulation mechanism <b>100</b> when a tool assembly is not loaded, to unlock articulation mechanism <b>100</b> when an articulable tool assembly is loaded, and to lock articulation mechanism <b>100</b> when a non-articulable tool assembly is loaded. For a more detailed discussion of the structure and function of the sensor mechanism, please refer to previously noted U.S. Pat. No. 5,865,361 to Milliman et al.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Turning now to <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, engagement of recesses <b>152</b><i>a </i>of engagement portion <b>152</b> of lug member <b>150</b> by a user and subsequent refraction of lug member <b>150</b> relative to second end <b>144</b><i>b </i>of elongate portion <b>144</b>, in the direction of arrow âAâ, causes retraction of locking tab <b>156</b> of lug member <b>150</b> from within central notch <b>135</b><i>a </i>of locking member <b>130</b>. In this second or unlocked position, articulation handle <b>140</b> is free to rotate relative to locking member <b>130</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, counter-clockwise rotation of articulation handle <b>140</b> relative to locking member <b>130</b>, in the direction of arrow âBâ, results in advancement of yoke <b>160</b>, and attached articulation linkage <b>50</b>, in the direction of arrow âCâ. As discussed above, articulation handle <b>140</b> is securely attached to shaft portion <b>114</b> of main shaft <b>110</b> such that rotation of articulation handle <b>140</b> turns main shaft <b>110</b>. Base portion <b>112</b> of main shaft <b>110</b> is connected to yoke <b>160</b> by cam member <b>165</b> such that the rotation of main shaft <b>110</b> in a first direction causes advancement of articulation linkage <b>50</b> while rotation of main shaft <b>110</b> in a second direction causes retraction of articulation linkage <b>50</b>. Advancement and retraction of articulation linkage <b>50</b> results in articulation of a tool assembly in respective first and second directions. The amount of rotation of articulation handle <b>140</b> is limited by the engagement of flange portion <b>146</b> of articulation handle <b>140</b> with first and second end walls <b>133</b><i>a</i>, <b>133</b><i>b </i>(<figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) of semi-circular cut-out <b>133</b> of locking member <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">With reference to <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, release of lug member <b>150</b> by the clinician permits the return of lug member <b>150</b> to an initial, non-retracted position. Lug member <b>150</b> is biased to the initial position by compression spring <b>155</b>. The return of lug member <b>150</b> to the initial position results in locking tab <b>156</b> being received within notch <b>135</b>, thereby locking articulation handle <b>140</b> relative to locking member <b>130</b>. In this manner, an articulable tool assembly (not shown) mounted on the distal end of elongate body <b>30</b> (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>) is locked in an articulated position. The tool assembly may be further articulated or returned to the initial, non-articulated position by retracting lug member <b>150</b> relative to second end <b>144</b><i>b </i>of elongated portion <b>144</b> and rotating articulation handle <b>140</b> relative to locking member <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">It will be understood that various modifications may be made to the embodiment disclosed herein. For example, with reference to <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, articulation mechanism <b>100</b> may further include a locking mechanism <b>170</b> for selectively locking lug member <b>150</b> relative to elongated portion <b>144</b> of articulation handle <b>140</b>. As shown, locking mechanism <b>170</b> includes a side mounted button <b>172</b> extending through second end <b>144</b><i>b </i>of elongated portion <b>144</b>. Button <b>172</b> is configured to selectively engage lug member <b>150</b> to prevent unlocking of articulation handle <b>140</b> relative to locking member <b>130</b>. Alternatively, articulation mechanism <b>100</b> may include a locking mechanism (not shown) that requires advancing lug member <b>150</b> relative to elongated portion <b>144</b> of articulation handle <b>140</b> prior to being able to retract lug member <b>150</b> relative thereto. Therefore, the above description should not be construed as limiting, but merely as exemplifications of particular embodiments. Those skilled in the art will envision other modifications within the scope and spirit of the claims appended hereto.</p>
