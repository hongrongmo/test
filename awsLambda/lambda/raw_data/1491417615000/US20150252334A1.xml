      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The invention relates to the fields of biochemistry, molecular biology, and molecular virology; particularly, the invention relates to a structural protein of rotavirus, VP6 protein, a method for preparing the protein, and a method for in vitro assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) containing the protein, wherein the protein and the VLPs may be useful for preventing or alleviating diarrhea caused by rotavirus infection.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Rotavirus (RV) belongs to the rotavirus genus belonging to the Reoviridae family, which is the main pathogen responsible for infant diarrhea and was found in duodenum from patients with gastroenteritis by Bishop in 1973 (Bishop, Davidson et al. 1973). Studies showed that more than 95% of children were infected with rotavirus at least once before 5 years old. According to statistics from WHO, up to 600,000 people died of rotavirus infection annually, cases of diarrhea reached up to 200 million; and in USA only, economic loss caused by rotavirus infection reached up to 100 million dollars annually (Hsu, Staat et al. 2005; Tate, Burton et al. 2011), resulting in serious financial burden and social burden.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Rotavirus is a nonenveloped RNA virus. The genome of rotavirus consists of 11 double-stranded RNA molecules which encode 6 structure proteins (VP1-VP4, VP6 and VP7) and 6 non-structure proteins (NSP1-NSP6) (Estes and Cohen 1989). Rotavirus is icosahedral, and its capsid consists of three concentric layers, i.e. the core layer consisting of VP1, VP2 and VP3, the inner capsid consisting of VP6, and the outer capsid consisting of VP4 and VP7. VP6 is a species-specific antigen, and depending on its antigenicity, rotavirus may be divided into 7 groups, i.e. rotavirus A-G, among which rotavirus A is the main pathogen responsible for diarrhea among infants and young children. The protein has a strong immunogenicity, and although it is not a neutralizing antigen, it can have a good immune protection (Sabara, Frenchick et al. 1994). VP4 and VP7 are the main neutralizing antigens, and, rotavirus A can be divided into serotype P and serotype G depending on the antigenicity of them, and can be divided into different genotypes depending on their genes. G type and P type are independent of each other and are also interacted; the common combinations include G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8] and G4P[8]; in recent years, G9P[8] and G9P[6] are more and more popular (Li, Liu et al. 2009).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">There are not specific drugs for rotavirus yet, and safe and effective vaccines are the important means for control of rotavirus infection. After years of research undergoing three phases, i.e. monovalent attenuated vaccines, polyvalent gene recombinant vaccines, and genetically engineering vaccines, there are four rotavirus vaccines appeared in the market one by one, including tetravalent human-ape gene recombinant vaccine from Wyeth, monovalent attenuated vaccine from Lanzhou Institute, pentavalent human-bovine gene recombinant vaccine from Merck, and monovalent attenuated vaccine from GSK. However, these vaccines are attenuated live vaccines which have large potential safety hazard, and the vaccines from Wyeth were recalled due to intestinal intussusception half a year after being in the market (Murphy, Gargiullo et al. 2001); although the vaccines from MERCK and GSK were demonstrated to be safe and effective by a large number of clinical tests (Bernstein, Sack et al. 1999; Vesikari, Matson et al. 2006; Linhares, Velazquez et al. 2008; Vesikari, Itzler et al. 2009; Snelling, Andrews et al. 2011), in countries and regions with a high rotavirus mortality such as Asia and Africa, the protection efficiency was much lower than that in developed countries such as Europe and America (Armah, Sow et al. 2010; Zaman, Anh et al. 2010; Madhi, Cunliffe et al. 2011). More and more evidence showed that upon vaccination with these two vaccines, shedding of virus occurred and horizontal transmission of virus might occur (Anderson 2008; Rivera, Pena et al. 2011; Yen, Jakob et al. 2011). It was also shown in some studies that serious gastroenteritis might be developed in children with immunologic deficiency after vaccination with the vaccines (Steele, Cunliffe et al. 2009; Patel, Hertel et al. 2010). The vaccines from Lanzhou Institute have been commercially available for more than 10 years, and no serious problem is found yet; however, they can only prevent serious diarrhea, and cannot prevent rotavirus infection (Fu, Wang et al. 2007). Therefore, although delightful results are obtained in studies on attenuated vaccines for rotavirus, there are also some problems and the safety and effectiveness need to be further improved. It is imperative to develop more safe and effective vaccines. Non-replicating vaccines are the main direction for studies on rotavirus vaccines now, and genetically engineering vaccines attract much attention because of the characteristics such as low cost, safety and effectiveness.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Genetically engineering vaccines mainly refer to antigens of rotavirus expressed by genetically engineering methods, which are used to immunize animal or human so as to achieve immune protection. Such vaccines include nucleic acid vaccines, synthetic peptide vaccines, recombinantly expressed antigen vaccine, and virus-like particles (VLPs) vaccines. The effectiveness and safety of VLPs vaccines now have been sufficiently demonstrated in the case of HBV, HEV and HPV vaccines, and have become a new generation of candidate vaccines with the greatest research value, as well recognized globally. The studies on RV-VLPs vaccines started in 80s of the last century, and a lot of animal experimental results showed that RV-VLP vaccines had good protective effect and could mediate a broad heterogenic protection.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">RV-VLP refers to virus-like particle consisting of structure proteins, which is similar to native virus particle in terms of shape and structure and retains the native conformation of virus particle without containing viral nucleic acids. The particles can be divided into two classes; one class is a trilayer particle consisting of VP2, VP4, VP6 and VP7, or a double-layered particle consisting of VP6 &amp; VP4, VP7, both of which can stimulate the generation of neutralizing antibodies in organisms (Crawford, Estes et al. 1999; Jiang, Estes et al. 1999); and the other class is a double-layered particle consisting of VP2 and VP6, and a monolayer particle consisting of VP6, which cannot stimulate the generation of neutralizing antibodies in organisms as they contain no neutralizing antigen, but also have a good protective effect as they can stimulate enhanced cell immunity in organisms (Coste, Sirard et al. 2000; Yuan, Geyer et al. 2000; Nguyen, Iosef et al. 2003); since variation in VP6 is relatively low, the particle can lead to a broad heterogenic protection. Relative to the first class of particles, the second class of particles have the same protective effect, but comprise less components, which greatly reduces processing difficulty and cost and thus are more favored.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The key for VP2/6-VLP vaccine development is to produce homogeneous VLP samples efficiently in a large amount. Insect baculovirus expression systems are commonly used now, and the rotavirus structure proteins VP2 and VP6 co-expressed in the system may self-assemble into VLP (Bertolotti-Ciarlet, Ciarlet et al. 2003). However, eukaryotic expression systems have the shortcomings such as high cost, long period, complex operations, and low expression level, and non-specific proteins and nucleic acids are generally encapsulated during the assembly, and thus it is difficult to achieve high-efficient and controllable assembly (Palomares and Ramirez 2009). Although there are studies on in vitro assembly of rotavirus VLP particles, the further development of RV VLP vaccines are restricted due to low yield.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Prokaryotic expression system has advantages such as low cost and simple operation. However, since prokaryotic expression system lacks specific posttranslational modifications, many proteins form inclusion bodies in prokaryotic expression. In current, there are studies showing that structure proteins of rotavirus were expressed in prokaryotic system, including VP6, VP4 and VP7, which were either expressed in inclusion bodies and unable to be renaturated effectively (Zhao, Chen et al. 2011), or expressed in a fusion form (Choi, Basu et al. 2000). Although fusion expression is favorable for the purification of desired proteins, expensive enzymes are generally required for cleavage of fusion proteins. Thus, prokaryotic expression system is not suitable for large-scale production.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Therefore, this field still demands techniques with low cost which can achieve high-efficient and controllable assembly and produce rotavirus structure proteins and virus-like particles at a large scale.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>

      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0036">Beneficial Effect of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0037">Presently, eukaryotic expression systems are used in the preparation of rotavirus VLPs, and the insect-baculovirus expression system is the most commonly used.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0038">The VP2 and VP6 proteins expressed in eukaryotic expression systems are closer to naturally occurring proteins in terms of conformation, and can self-assemble into VLPs in vivo. However, eukaryotic expression systems have the shortcomings, such as long expression period, complex operation, low expression level, non-specific encapsulation of undesired proteins and nucleic acids in assembly process, especially the formation of different types of virus-like particles during co-expression of several proteins, and difficulty in subsequent purification, and thus can hardly achieve assembly in a high efficient and controllable manner. It is quite difficult to apply a eukaryotic expression system to industrial production in a large scale.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0039">Prokaryotic expression system, especially <i>E. coli </i>expression system has advantages such as low cost, short period, and high expression level, and are the most commonly used and well established expression system for recombinant proteins. However, the rotavirus capsid protein expressed in <i>E. coli </i>expression system is generally unable to form a correct confirmation and is in a form of inclusion body, while the protein in inclusion body is difficult to be renaturated, and the efficiency is low. Thus, it is difficult to apply a prokaryotic expression system to a large-scale production. Fusion expression can accomplish soluble expression of VP6, but expensive enzymes are generally required for cleavage of a fusion protein generally. Thus, fusion expression cannot be applied to a large-scale production.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0040">In the invention, the capsid protein VP6 of rotavirus A is expressed in the <i>E. coli </i>expression system; most of nucleic acids and some undesired proteins can be removed by a pretreatment of PEI or metal ion precipitation, and the VP6 protein is still kept in supernatant in a soluble form. After salting-out and chromatographic purification, VP6 protein with a purity of above 95% can be obtained. After analysis, the protein is present in a form of trimer in the solution, i.e. retains the correct conformation of VP6 protein. The process has the advantages such as simple operation, low cost and high yield, and thus can be applied to industrial production in a large scale. The purified VP6 protein obtained by said steps can be self-assembled into a monolayer particle 6-VLP, and can also be co-assembled with VP2 in a particulate or non-particulate state to form a double-layered particle 2/6-VLP. The process is simple and controllable, and has an assembly efficiency of above 95%, significantly higher than the efficiency of self-assembly of the protein expressed in a eukaryotic cell. As verified experimentally in mice, VP6 protein and its VLPs obtained by prokaryotic expression have high immunogenicity and good protective effect, and are potential as a candidate vaccine for rotavirus.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0041">Therefore, the invention has the following advantages. The preparation method of the invention neither needs high cost and complex process (as eukaryotic expression needs), nor needs expensive enzymes, and are convenient with respect to operation and cheap with respect to cost. Moreover, the preparation method retains the correct conformation of VP6 since the purification process does not undergo drastic denaturation and renaturation. The protein may be self-assembled into 6-VLP or co-assembled with VP2 to form 2/6-VLP, has a good immunogenicity, and exhibits a good immune protection in mouse experiments. The methods of the invention for preparing VP6 protein and virus-like particles (VLPs) thereof may be applied to industrial production in a large scale. The VP6 protein and VLPs thereof of the invention may be used for preventing diarrhea caused by rotavirus infection.</p>

      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0093">The equipment was Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuger, and the methods were sedimentation velocity method and sedimentation equilibrium method. Firstly, the sedimentation coefficients of VP2 protein and VP6 protein were analyzed by sedimentation velocity method, SEDIFIT software was used to carry out C(S) analysis, and the molecular weights of VP2 protein and VP6 protein were calculated primarily. The results showed that VP2 protein and VP6 protein might be present in a form of dimer and trimer, respectively. On the basis of this, the precise molecular weights of VP2 protein and VP6 protein were further analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium method. Origin Nonlin software and SEDPHAT software were used to analyze SE. The results showed that VP2 protein and VP6 protein had a molecular weight of 204Â±5.6 KDa and 114.9Â±1.6 KDa, respectively (<figref>FIG. 3C</figref> and <figref>FIG. 3D</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0094">VP2 protein of native state is present in a form of dimer, and VP6 protein is present in a form of trimer, and their theoretic molecular weights are 205 KDa and 135 KDa, respectively. It was identified by analytic ultracentrifugation that the purified VP2 protein had a molecular weight of 204Â±5.6 KDa, which was consistent with the theoretic molecular weight. However, since SDS can interrupt hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction, VP2 in SDS-PAGE is mainly in a form of monomer. It was identified by analytic ultracentrifugation that the purified VP6 protein had a molecular weight of 114.9Â±1.6 KDa, and was present in a form of polymer in SDS-PAGE, which was between 119 and 211 KDa in size. According to the SDS-PAGE results in combination with the analytic ultracentrifugation results, the purified VP6 protein was present in a form of trimer. It was consistent with the result of size exclusion chromatography, i.e. the retention time of VP2 protein was shorter than that of VP6 protein. Accordingly, VP2 and VP6 protein obtained by prokaryotic expression retained their native confirmations. Moreover, the whole process was simple and was convenient for operation, and thus had incomparable advantages relative to eukaryotic expression.</p>

The immunization procedure was as followed: the primary immunization at Day 0, and the boosters at Day 10 and Day 20, and a final booster at Day 30 (using antigens in the same dose mixed with aluminum adjuvant by muscular injection). Peripheral venous blood was taken two weeks after the last immunization, and serum was isolated and stored for further detection. Female mice and male mice were kept in the same cage, and male mice were taken out after mating. Neonatal mice were challenged with a virus 4-6 days after birth, at a dose of 5*10<sup>6 </sup>TCID50 per neonatal mouse, wherein the virus was human rotavirus obtained by MA104 cell culture. After challenging with the virus, health condition of the neonatal mice was observed and recorded, such as diarrhea condition, and change in weight. A mouse was killed at each of 0, 24, 48 and 72 hpc, pathological changes in tissues of the mice were observed after anatomy, small intestine tissues were taken, and the virus was detected by methods such as immunohistochemistry and EIA.

Mice were scored depending on the color and shape of feces, and it was found that diarrhea was most serious in neonatal mice 24 h after challenging with virus. The results were shown in Table 5. Within 24 h after challenging with virus, obvious diarrhea symptoms developed in the control group, while no diarrhea or only mild diarrhea symptoms developed in the experimental groups. Antibodies from mother mice immunized with VP6, 6-VLP, 2/6-VLP and inactivated virus alleviated the symptoms of diarrhea in neonatal mice, there was no significant difference among antibodies from mother mice immunized with VP6, 2/6-VLP and inactivated virus with respect to immune protection (P value was 0.070 and 0.946, respectively), while immune protection of 6-VLP was significantly lower than that of RV (P=0.001) and 2/6-VLP (P&lt;0.001).</p>
