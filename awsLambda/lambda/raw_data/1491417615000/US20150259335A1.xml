      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The eye comprises several structurally and functionally distinct vascular beds, which supply ocular components critical to the maintenance of vision. These include the retinal and choroidal vasculatures, which supply the inner and outer portions of the retina, respectively, and the limbal vasculature located at the periphery of the cornea. Injuries and diseases that impair the normal structure or function of these vascular beds are among the leading causes of visual impairment and blindness. For example, diabetic retinopathy is a common disease affecting the retinal vasculature, and is a leading cause of vision loss among the working age population in the United States. Vascularization of the cornea secondary to injury or disease is yet another category of ocular vascular disease that can lead to severe impairment of vision.</p>

      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0066">Provided herein are compounds and methods of treating ocular disorders that are characterized by vascular instability, vascular leakage, and neovascularization. HPTP-Î² is a member of the receptor-like family of the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). HPTP-Î² is a transmembrane protein found primarily in endothelial cells that displays structural and functional similarity to cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). HPTP-Î² is unique among receptor-like PTPases in that it contains a single catalytic domain. One of the main functions of HPTP-Î² is to regulate Tie-2 negatively.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0067">Tie-2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase found almost exclusively in endothelial cells. The principle regulators of Tie-2 phosphorylation are Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2). Upon Ang-1 binding to Tie-2, the level of Tie-2 receptor phosphorylation increases. The duration of Tie-2 receptor phosphorylation is regulated by HPTP-Î², which cleaves off the phosphate. Tie-2 receptor phosphorylation helps maintain endothelial cell proximity; therefore, the duration of Tie-2 receptor phosphorylation is an important determinant of endothelial cell proximity For example, when severe inflammation occurs, the capillary endothelial cells separate, allowing proteins to enter the interstitial space. Separation of the capillary endothelial cells, and subsequent leak of proteins in the interstitial space, is known as vascular leak, and can lead to dangerous hypotension, edema, hemoconcentration, and hypoalbuminemia.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0068">The present disclosure relates to compositions and methods for treating conditions, such as ocular diseases, wherein neovasculatization and vascular leakage can be present. These diseases can display an elevated angiogenic response in ocular vessels. The present disclosure describes HPTP-Î² inhibitors that can provide vascular stabilization.</p>

      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0069">Compounds disclosed herein can be effective as Tie-2 activators. The compounds can effect that activity, for example, by binding to or inhibiting HPTP-Î². Such compounds can bind to HPTP-Î², for example, by mimicking the binding mechanism of a native substrate, such as a phosphorylated compound. A compound can be a phosphate mimetic or bioisostere, for example, a sulfamic acid. The compound could also be derived from an amino acid building block or comprise an amino acid backbone for efficiency and economy of synthesis.</p>

      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="2">Optical Activity.</heading>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0104">Optical activity is the ability of a chiral molecule to rotate a plane of polarized light. Molecules that can rotate a beam of light are optically active. Those that rotate light clockwise are dextrorotatory, and those that rotate light counterclockwise are levorotatory. If only one enantiomer is present in a sample, the sample is optically pure. When both enatiomers are present in equal amounts, the effects of optical rotation sum to zero. If a mixture of enantiomers is present, but one enatiomer is in excess, the sample is optically active.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0105">Optical activity can be measured using a polarimeter, which determines the specific rotation of a substance based upon the temperature, wavelength of light used, and concentration of the substance, expressed as the angle to which the material causes polarized light to rotate. A polarimeter holds a sample tube, through which light is passed via a polarizing filter. The analyzing lens is rotated such that the light is visible to the user; the amount (expressed in degrees) that the lens must be rotated to make the light visible is known as the observed rotation, and is used to calculate the specific rotation of the sample being tested.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0106">The specific rotation of a sample can be about +1Â°, about â1Â°, about +2Â°, about â2Â°, about +3Â°, about â3Â°, about +4Â°, about â4Â°, about +5Â°, about â5Â°, about +6Â°, about â6Â°, about +7Â°, about â7Â°, about +8Â°, about â8Â°, about +9Â°, about â9Â°, about +10Â°, about â10Â°, about +11Â°, about â11Â°, about +12Â°, about â12Â°, about +13Â°, about â13Â°, about +14Â°, about 14Â°, about +15Â°, about â15Â°, about +16Â°, about â16Â°, about +17Â°, about â17Â°, about +18Â°, about â18Â°, about +19Â°, about â19Â°, about +20Â°, about â20Â°, about +21Â°, about â21Â°, about +22Â°, about â22Â°, about +23Â°, about â23Â°, about +24Â°, about â24Â°, about +25Â°, about â25Â°, about +26Â°, about â26Â°, about +27Â°, about â27Â°, about +28Â°, about â28Â°, about +29Â°, about â29Â°, about +30Â°, about â30Â°, about +40Â°, about â40Â°, about +50Â°, about â50Â°, about +60Â°, about â60Â°, about +70Â°, about â70Â°, about +80Â°, about â80Â°, about +90Â°, about â90Â°, about +100Â°, about â100Â°, about +110Â°, about â110Â°, about +120Â°, about â120Â°, about +130Â°, about â130Â°, about +140Â°, about â140Â°, about +150Â°, about â150Â°, about +160Â°, about â160Â°, about +170Â°, about â170Â°, about +180Â°, about â180Â°, about +190Â°, about â190Â°, about +200Â°, about â200Â°, about +210Â°, about â210Â°, about +220Â°, about â220Â°, about +230Â°, about â230Â°, about +240Â°, about â240Â°, about +250Â°, about â250Â°, about +260Â°, about â260Â°, about +270Â°, about â270Â°, about +280Â°, about â280Â°, about +290Â°, about â290Â°, about +300Â°, about â300Â°, about +310Â°, about â310Â°, about +320Â°, about â320Â°, about +330Â°, about â330Â°, about +340Â°, about â340Â°, about +350Â°, about â350Â°, about +360Â°, or about â360Â°.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0107">Circular dichroism (CD) is the difference in absorption of left-handed circularly polarised light (L-CPL) and right-handed circularly polarised light (R-CPL), and occurs when a molecule contains one or more chiral light-absorbing groups. Optically active chiral molecules preferentially absorb one direction of the polarized light, causing differently polarized light beams to travel through an optically active medium with different velocites.</p>

      <heading id="h-00020-en" level="2">Methods.</heading>
      <p id="p-00215-en" num="0173">Disclosed herein are methods for the treatment of diseases or conditions of the eye, for example, diabetic macular edema, age-related macular degeneration (including wet form), choroidal neovascularization, diabetic retinopathy, ocular ischemia, uveitis, retinal vein occlusion (central or branch), ocular trauma, surgery induced edema, surgery induced neovascularization, cystoid macular edema, ocular ischemia, changes in central foveal thickness, and uveitis. These diseases or conditions can be characterized by changes in the ocular vasculature whether progressive or non-progressive, whether a result of an acute disease or condition, or a chronic disease or condition. In some embodiments, these diseases can be characterized by an increased level of plasma Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF).</p>
      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0174">In some embodiments, the disclosed methods relate to the administration of the HPTP-Î² inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as well as compositions comprising the HPTP-Î² inhibitor or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0175">In some embodiments, the methods of the disclosure are drawn towards co-administration of a HPTP-Î² inhibitor or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof which stabilizes the vasculature against leakage, and one or more anti-VEGF agents.</p>
      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0176">In some embodiments, the methods of the disclosure are drawn towards co-administration of a HPTP-Î² inhibitor or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof which stabilizes the vasculature against neovascularization, and one or more anti-VEGF agents.</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0177">In some embodiments, the inhibitor stabilizes the vasculature against leakage and neovascularization.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0178">In some embodiments, a human subject with at least one visually impaired eye is treated with an HPTP-Î² inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof via subcutaneous or intravitreal injection Improvement of clinical symptoms can be monitored via, for example, indirect ophthalmoscopy, fundus photography, fluorescein angiopathy, electroretinography, external eye examination, slit lamp biomicroscopy, applanation tonometry, pachymetry, optical coherence tomography and autorefaction. As described herein, the dosing can occur at any frequency determined by the administrator. After cessation of the anti-VEGF agent treatment, subsequent doses can be administered weekly or monthly, e.g., with a frequency of 2-8 weeks or 1-12 months apart depending upon the response.</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0179">One aspect of the disclosed methods relates to diseases that are a direct or indirect result of diabetes, inter alia, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy. The ocular vasculature of the diabetic becomes unstable over time leading to conditions such as non-proliferative retinopathy, macular edema, and proliferative retinopathy. As fluid leaks into the center of the macula, the part of the eye where sharp, straight-ahead vision occurs, the buildup of fluid and the associated protein begin to deposit on or under the macula. This results in swelling that causes the subject's central vision to become distorted. This condition is referred to as âmacular edema.â Another condition that can occur is non-proliferative retinopathy in which vascular changes, such as microaneurysms, outside the macular region of the eye can be observed.</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0180">These conditions can progress to diabetic proliferative retinopathy, which is characterized by increased neovascularization. These new blood vessels are fragile and are susceptible to bleeding. The result is scarring of the retina, as well as occlusion or total blockage of the light pathway through the eye due to the over formation of new blood vessels. Diabetic macular edema can begin during either the proliferative or non-proliferative stage of diabetic retinopathy.</p>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0181">Diabetic retinopathy is a common cause of vision loss in working-aged Americans. Severe vision loss can occur due to tractional retinal detachments that complicate retinal neovascularization (NV), and moderate vision loss can be caused by diabetic macular edema (DME). The pathogenesis of DME can involve hypoxia. VEGF is a hypoxia-regulated gene, and VEGF levels are increased in hypoxic or ischemic retina. Injection of VEGF into mouse eyes causes breakdown of the inner blood-retinal barrier and sustained release of VEGF in the eyes of monkeys causes macular edema.</p>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0182">The effects of VEGF on vascular endothelial cells are modulated by Tie2 receptors, which are selectively expressed on vascular endothelial cells and are required for embryonic vascular development. Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) binds Tie2 with high affinity and initiates phosphorylation and downstream signaling. Angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) binds Tie2 with high affinity, but does not stimulate phosphorylation in cultured endothelial cells. Ang2 acts as a competitive inhibitor of Ang1 and transgenic mice overexpressing Ang2 have a phenotype similar to Ang1 -deficient mice, and Ang2 is a developmentally- and hypoxia-regulated permissive factor for VEGF-induced neovascularization in the retina. Ang2 reduces stabilizing signals from the matrix making endothelial cells dependent upon VEGF and other soluble stimulators; when VEGF is high, neovascularization is stimulated and when VEGF is low, neovascularization regresses. In contrast, Ang1 increases stabilizing signals from the matrix and makes the vasculature unresponsive to soluble stimulators like VEGF.</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0183">Angiopoietin 2 binds Tie2, but does not stimulate phosphorylation and therefore acts as an antagonist under most circumstances. In the eye, Ang2 is upregulated at sites of neovascularization and acts as a permissive factor for VEGF. Increased expression of VEGF in the retina does not stimulate sprouting of neovascularization from the superficial or intermediate capillary beds of the retina or the choriocapillaris, but does stimulate sprouting from the deep capillary bed. Co-expression of VEGF and Ang2 at the surface of the retina causes sprouting of neovascularization from the superficial retinal capillaries.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0184">Macular degeneration is a condition characterized by a gradual loss or impairment of eyesight due to cell and tissue degeneration of the yellow macular region in the center of the retina. Macular degeneration is often characterized as one of two types, non-exudative (dry form) or exudative (wet form). Although both types are bilateral and progressive, each type can reflect different pathological processes. The wet form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common form of choroidal neovascularization and a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. AMD affects millions of Americans over the age of 60, and is a leading cause of new blindness among the elderly.</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0185">Choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) is a problem that is related to a wide variety of retinal diseases, and is commonly linked to AMD. With CNVM, abnormal blood vessels stemming from the choroid (the blood vessel-rich tissue layer just beneath the retina) grow up through the retinal layers. These new vessels are very fragile and break easily, causing blood and fluid to pool within the layers of the retina.</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0186">Diabetes (diabetes mellitus) is a metabolic disease caused by the inability of the pancreas to produce insulin or to use the insulin that is produced. The most common types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes (often referred to as Juvenile Onset Diabetes Mellitus) and type 2 diabetes (often referred to as Adult Onset Diabetes Mellitus). Type 1 diabetes results from the body's failure to produce insulin due to loss of insulin producing cells, and presently requires the person to inject insulin. Type 2 diabetes generally results from insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to use insulin properly.</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0187">Diabetes can be correlated to a large number of other conditions, including conditions or diseases of the eye including diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME), which are leading causes of vision loss and blindness in most developed countries. The increasing number of individuals with diabetes worldwide suggests that DR and DME continue to be major contributors to vision loss and associated functional impairment for years to come.</p>
      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0188">DR is a complication of diabetes that results from damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). In early stages, DR frequently causes no symptoms or only mild vision problems. Eventually, DR can result in blindness. DR can develop in anyone who has type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes.</p>
      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0189">At its earliest stage, non-proliferative retinopathy, microaneurysms occur in the retina's tiny blood vessels. As the disease progresses, more of these blood vessels become damaged or blocked and these areas of the retina send signals into the regional tissue to grow new blood vessels for nourishment. This stage is called proliferative retinopathy. The new blood vessels grow along the retina and along the surface of the clear, vitreous gel that fills the inside of the eye. By themselves, these blood vessels do not cause symptoms or vision loss. However, without timely treatment, these new blood vessels can leak blood (whole blood or some constituents thereof), resulting in severe vision loss and even blindness. Also, fluid can leak into the center of the macula, the part of the eye where sharp, straight-ahead vision occurs. The fluid and the associated proteins begin to deposit on or under the macula, which causesthe patient's central vision to become distorted. This condition is called macular edema, and can occur at any stage of diabetic retinopathy, but is more likely to occur as the disease progresses. About half of the people with proliferative retinopathy also have macular edema.</p>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0190">Uveitis is a condition in which the uvea becomes inflamed. The eye is shaped much like a tennis ball, hollow on the inside with three different layers of tissue surrounding a central cavity. The outermost is the sclera (white coat of the eye) and the innermost is the retina. The middle layer between the sclera and the retina is called the uvea. The uvea contains many of the blood vessels that nourish the eye. Complications of uveitis include glaucoma, cataracts or new blood vessel formation (neovascularization).</p>
      <p id="p-00233-en" num="0191">Ocular trauma is any sort of physical or chemical injury to the eye. Symptoms include redness or pain in the affected eye.</p>
      <p id="p-00234-en" num="0192">Surgery-induced edema is the development of swelling in the eye tissues following surgery on the retina or other part of the eye. Cystoid macular edema (CME) is an example of this phenomenon. CME can occur not only in people who have had cataract surgery, but also those with diabetes, retinitis pigmentosa, AMD, or conditions that cause chronic inflammation in the eye. Symptoms of CME include blurred or decreased central vision.</p>
      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0193">Ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS) encompasses the signs and symptoms that result from chronic vascular insufficiency. This condition is caused by ocular hypoperfusion due to occlusion or stenosis of the common or internal carotid arteries. OIS generally affects those between the ages of 50-80, who can also have systemic diseases such as hypertension or diabetes. Symptoms of OIS include orbital pain, vision loss, changes of the visual field, asymmetric cataract, and sluggish reaction to light.</p>
      <p id="p-00236-en" num="0194">Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the most common retinal vascular disease after diabetic retinopathy. Depending on the area of retinal venous drainage effectively occluded, the condition can be classified as central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), hemispheric retinal vein occlusion (HRVO), or branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). Each type has two subtypes. Presentation of RVO is with variable painless visual loss with any combination of fundal findings consisting of retinal vascular tortuosity, retinal hemorrhages (blot and flame shaped), cotton wool spots, optic disc swelling, and macular edema. In a CRVO, retinal hemorrhages can be found in all four quadrants of the fundus, whereas these are restricted to either the superior or inferior fundal hemisphere in a HRVO. In a BRVO, hemorrhages are largely localized to the area drained by the occluded branch retinal vein. Vision loss occurs secondary to macular edema or ischemia.</p>
      <p id="p-00237-en" num="0195">Angiogenesis, the process of creating new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, is essential to a wide range of physiological and pathological events including embryological development, menstruation, wound healing, and tumor growth. Most tumors require angiogenesis to grow and proliferate. VEGF is a major factor in angiogenesis, which can increase vessel permeability and capillary number.</p>
      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0196">Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a protein that is primarily found in endothelial cells and has functions in vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and permeabilization of blood vessels. The expression of VEGF is induced by hypoxia, activated oncogenes, and cytokines. VEGF activation not only leads to angiogenesis in normal human cells and tissues, but also angiogenesis in tumors, allowing for tumor progression and growth Inhibition of VEGF inhibits tumor growth leading to tumor regression.</p>
      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0197">A variety of retinopathies are associated with increased levels of VEGF. Ischemia in the eye leads to an induction of VEGF production due to lack of oxygen. This increase in VEGF can cause hyperproliferation of blood vessels in the retina, eventually leading to blindness. The disclosed HPTP-Î² inhibitors act to stabilize ocular vasculature and, in some embodiments, a compound of the invention can counteract the stimulation caused by VEGF and other inflammatory agents that can be present in the diseased retina.</p>

Visual acuity (VA) is acuteness or clearness of vision, which is dependent on the sharpness of the retinal focus within the eye and the sensitivity of the interpretative faculty of the brain. Visual acuity is a measure of the spatial resolution of the visual processing system. VA is tested by requiring the person whose vision is being tested to identify characters, typically numbers or letters, on a chart from a set distance. Chart characters are represented as black symbols against a white background. The distance between the person's eyes and the testing chart is set at a sufficient distance to approximate infinity in the way the lens attempts to focus. Twenty feet, or six meters, is essentially infinity from an optical perspective.</p>

      <p id="p-00308-en" num="0247">A cell-based assay of compounds A-D is described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00309-en" num="0248">Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated freshly from human placenta, grown in endothelial growth medium, and used before passage 6. To evaluate the effects of the compounds on phosphorylation of Tie2 and downstream signaling molecules, cells were serum-starved in endothelial basal medium without added growth factors for 3 hours before stimulation. Cells were treated for 10 minutes with vehicle (DMSO), or compounds A, B, C, or D in DMSO. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 5 mM benzamidine) plus complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets. Tie2 was then immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with a mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 33) and probed sequentially with mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) and anti-Tie2 (clone 33). Whole cell lysates were used to quantify phospho-AKT with the PathScan Phospho-Akt1 (Ser473) Sandwich ELISA Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative AKT phosphorylation in each experiment was quantified by OD<sub>450</sub>.</p>
      <p id="p-00310-en" num="0249">
        <figref>FIG. 44</figref> is a western blot of Tie2 immunoprecipitated from endothelial cells treated with DMSO control or the indicated compounds (D, C, B, or A), and then sequentially probed with an anti-Tie2 antibody to detect total Tie2 (lower blot) and an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to detect phosphorylated Tie2 (upper blot). The blot shows that Tie2 was immunoprecipitated at relatively equal amounts, whereas Tie2 phosphorylation differed between the treatment conditions. Treatment with compound D resulted in a substantial increase in Tie2 phosphorylation compared to the DMSO control. An increase inTie2 phosphorylation compared to the DMSO control was not detected for compounds A, B, and C.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 45</figref> represents data from an ELISA to determine Akt phosphorylation, a measure of Tie2 activation. Consistent with <figref>FIG. 44</figref>, compound D had the strongest effect on Tie2 activation, as determined by the high levels (OD<sub>450</sub>=1.2) of relative Akt phosphorylation even at the lowest dose of compound D (1 Î¼g/mL). Akt phosphorylation significantly increased (OD<sub>450</sub>=3.1) using compound D at 3 Î¼g/mL reaching a maximum of Akt phosphorylation, which did not increase further at the highest dose of compound D (10 Î¼g/mL). Compound A had a moderate effect on Akt phosphorylation and began to show effects at 3 Î¼g/mL, where Akt phosphorylation slightly increased (OD<sub>450</sub>=0.2). Akt phosphorylation further increased (OD<sub>450</sub>=0.45) when 10 Î¼g/mL of compound A was used. Compounds B and C had similar effects on Akt phosphorylation, moderately increasing Akt phosphorylation (OD<sub>450 </sub>around 0.2) most significantly when used at 10 Î¼g/mL.</p>

      <p id="p-00314-en" num="0252">To a 100 mL volumetric flask containing water (85 mL) were charged HPÎ²CD (10 g) and dextrose (1.5 g). The solution was stirred for 1 hour at 20Â° C., then the volume made up to 100 mL with additional distilled water. The resulting solution was 10% HPÎ²3CD and 1.5% dextrose.</p>
      <p id="p-00315-en" num="0253">In a similar manner, solutions comprising 15% HPÎ²CD/1.5% dextrose and 17.5% HPÎ²CD/1.5% dextrose were prepared. These stock solutions were used for the following experiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00316-en" num="0254">In a 25 mL volumetric flask was added the stock solution comprising 10% HPÎ²CD/1.5% dextrose followed by the addition of the sodium salt of compound D (550 mg). The total volume was made up to 25 mL by the addition of distilled water. The resulting solution had a nominal concentration of compound D of 20 mg/mL after applying a molecular weight correction factor.</p>
      <p id="p-00317-en" num="0255">Similarly, to a stock solution comprising 10% HPÎ²CD/1.5% dextrose was added compound D (687 mg). After dilution to 25 mL the resulting solution had a nominal concentration of compound D of 25 mg/mL after applying a molecular weight correction factor.</p>

      <p id="p-00336-en" num="0273">Described herein is a study of four human subjects with visual acuity loss due to diabetic macular edema (central retinal thickness [CRT] of more than 325 microns and best corrected visual acuity less than 70 letters) that were treated with subcutaneous injections of 5 mg of 4-{(S)-2-[(S)-2-methoxycarbonyl-amino]-3-phenylpropanamido]-2-[2-(thiophen-2-yl)thiazol-4-yl]ethyl} phenylsulfamic acid twice a day for 28 days. Improvement of visual acuity in these subjects was observed for a period of two months (days 28 through 84). At any time during the course of the study, investigators could administer additional therapy of intravitreal injection of an anti-VEGF agent, for example, ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and/or aflibercept, if considered by the investigator to be medically necessary. Retinal thickness as measured by ocular coherence tomography and best-corrected visual acuity as measured by a standard vision test (ETDRS) were assessed at regular intervals during the 28 day active treatment phase and through the 2 month post-treatment observation phase, (Screening, Day 1 [baseline], Day 7, Day 14, Day 21, Day 28, Day 42, Day 56 and Day 84). The main efficacy outcomes for the study were change in CRT and visual acuity over time with treatment.</p>
