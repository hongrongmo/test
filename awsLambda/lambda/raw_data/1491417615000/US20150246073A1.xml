      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to an enriched heterogeneous mammalian kidney-derived cell population, methods of identifying the cell population, methods for their use in the preparation of a regenerative medicine therapy, and methods for treating kidney disease by administration of the enriched heterogeneous kidney-derived cell population to a mammalian subject are provided herein.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Collagen and gelatin-based biomaterials have been successfully employed for a variety of tissue engineering applications (Rohanizadeh et al. J Mater Sci Mater Med 2008; 19: 1173-1182; Takemoto et al. Tissue Eng Part A 2008; 14: 1629-1638; Young et al. J Control Release 2005; 109: 256-274). Both of these macromolecules are characterized by excellent biocompatibility and low antigenicity (Cenni et al. J Biomater Sci Polym Ed 2000; 11: 685-699; Lee et al. Int J Pharm 2001; 221: 1-22; Waksman et al. J Immunol 1949; 63: 427-433); however, since gelatin is obtained by the hydrolysis of collagen, it has certain advantages over the latter: (a) it is readily available and easy to use; (b) offers options relative to molecular weight and bloom (i.e. control over physical properties); and (c) is more flexible towards chemical modification and more straightforward to manufacture. Moreover, from a biological standpoint, gelatin maintains cytocompatibility and cell adherence properties similar to collagen Engvall et al. Int J Cancer 1977; 20: 1-5; Kim et al. Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod 2009; 108: e94-100).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Various methods have been reported for the crosslinking of these macromolecules for the purpose of delaying their biodegradation to prolong their in vivo residence (in tissue engineering applications) or tailoring their drug releasing capacity (when used as drug carriers). Numerous methods have been published for chemical or photochemical crosslinking of collagen or gelatin (Adhirajan et al. J Microencapsul 2007; 24: 647-659; Chang et al. Macromol Biosci 2007; 7: 500-507; Gagnieu et al. Biomed Mater Eng 2007; 17: 9-18; Kimura et al. J Biomater Sci Polym Ed 2010; 21: 463-476; Ma et al. J Biomed Mater Res A 2004; 71: 334-342; Vandelli et al. Int J Pharm 2001; 215: 175-184; Vandelli et al. J Control Release 2004; 96: 67-84). The majority of these procedures are targeted to reduce the susceptibility of these biomaterials to enzymatic degradation and to extend their in viva residence time (Chang et al. supra 2007; Ma et al. supra 2004). Other crosslinking methods are typically employed to yield gelatin or collagen-based biomaterials suitable as slow release drug, protein or nucleic acid carriers (Kimura supra 2010; Vandelli supra 2004; Kommareddy et al. Nanomedicine 2007; 3: 32-42; Sehgal et al. Expert Opin Drug Deliv 2009; 6: 687-695; Sutter et al. J Control Release 2007; 119: 301-312). A widely used crosslinking agent class for collagen and gelatin as well as other tissue engineering-compatible systems is the carbodilmides (Adhirajan supra 2007; Olde Damink et al. Biomaterials 1996; 17: 765-773; Pieper et al. Biomaterials 2000; 21: 581-593; Comwell et al. Clin Podiatr Med Surg 2009; 26: 507-523). These molecules are known as zero-length crosslinkers and act by mediating the formation of amide bonds between carboxyl and primary amine functionalities present on the species to be crosslinked. In addition, carbodiimides are less cytotoxic compared to other common crosslinking agent (e.g. glutaraldehyde) (Lai et al. J Mater Sci Mater Med 2010; 21: 1899-1911). Glutaraldehylde is used as a crosslinker in Cultispherbeads. Burg U.S. Pat. No. 6,991,652 describes tissue engineering composites containing three-dimensional support constructs for cells that may be delivered to a subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Regenerative medicine technologies provide next-generation therapeutic options for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Presnell et al. WO/2010/056328 and Ilagan et al. PCT/US2011/036347 describe isolated bioactive renal cells, including tubular and erythropoietin (EPO)-producing kidney cell populations, and methods of isolating and culturing the same, as well as methods of treating a subject in need with the cell populations.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">There is a need for therapeutic formulations that are suitable for delivery of active agents, such as for example, bioactive cells in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications, to subjects in need.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The kidney is a complex organ that performs many functions to keep the blood clean and chemically balanced. In addition to removing wastes, the kidneys release three important hormones:</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">erythropoietin, or EPO, which stimulates the bone marrow to make red blood cells</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">renin, which regulates blood pressure; and</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, which helps maintain calcium for bones and for normal chemical balance in the body.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">To perform these functions the kidney comprises numerous different cell types. However, not all renal cells are required for a regenerative response and identifying the combination of cells useful in eliciting a regenerative response has been the subject of investigation. Thus, there remains a need for methods that identify a heterogeneous renal cell population, i.e. bioactive cells, that finds use in the therapeutic formulations disclosed herein.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

The present disclosure also provides therapeutically-active cell populations lacking cellular components compared to a healthy individual, which cell populations can be, in one embodiment, isolated and expanded from autologous sources in various disease states.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Although bioactive cell formulations are described herein, the present disclosure contemplates formulations containing a variety of other active agents. Other suitable active agents include, without limitation, cellular aggregates, acellular biomaterials, secreted products from bioactive cells, large and small molecule therapeutics, as well as combinations thereof. For example, one type of bioactive cells may be combined with biomaterial-based microcarriers with or without therapeutic molecules or another type of bioactive cells, unattached cells may be combined with acellular particles.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">1. DEFINITIONS</heading>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. <i>Principles of Tissue Engineering, </i>3<sup>rd </sup>Ed. (Edited by R Lanza, R Langer, &amp; J Vacanti), 2007 provides one skilled in the art with a general guide to many of the terms used in the present application. One skilled in the art will recognize many methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein, which could be used in the practice of the present invention. Indeed, the present invention is in no way limited to the methods and materials described.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The term âcell populationâ as used herein refers to a number of cells obtained by isolation directly from a suitable tissue source, usually from a mammal. The isolated cell population may be subsequently cultured in vitro. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that various methods for isolating and culturing cell populations for use with the present invention and various numbers of cells in a cell population that are suitable for use in the present invention. A cell population may be an unfractionated, heterogeneous cell population derived from an organ or tissue, e.g., the kidney. For example, a heterogeneous cell population may be isolated from a tissue biopsy or from whole organ tissue. Alternatively, the heterogeneous cell population may be derived from in vitro cultures of mammalian cells, established from tissue biopsies or whole organ tissue. An unfractionated heterogeneous cell population may also be referred to as a non-enriched cell population. In one embodiment, the cell populations contain bioactive cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The term ânative organâ shall mean the organ of a living subject. The subject may be healthy or un-healthy. An unhealthy subject may have a disease associated with that particular organ.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The term ânative kidneyâ shall mean the kidney of a living subject. The subject may be healthy or un-healthy. An unhealthy subject may have a kidney disease.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The term âregenerative effectâ shall mean an effect which provides a benefit to a native organ, such as the kidney. The effect may include, without limitation, a reduction in the degree of injury to a native organ or an improvement in, restoration of, or stabilization of a native organ function. Renal injury may be in the form of fibrosis, inflammation, glomerular hypertrophy, etc. and related to a disease associated with the native organ in the subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The term âadmixtureâ as used herein refers to a combination of two or more isolated, enriched cell populations derived from an unfractionated, heterogeneous cell population. According to certain embodiments, the cell populations are renal cell populations.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">An âenrichedâ cell population or preparation refers to a cell population derived from a starting organ cell population (e.g., an unfractionated, heterogeneous cell population) that contains a greater percentage of a specific cell type than the percentage of that cell type in the starting population. For example, a starting kidney cell population can be enriched for a first, a second, a third, a fourth, a fifth, and so on, cell population of interest. As used herein, the terms âcell populationâ, âcell preparationâ and âcell prototypeâ are used interchangeably.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In one aspect, the term âenrichedâ cell population as used herein refers to a cell population derived from a starting organ cell population (e.g., a cell suspension from a kidney biopsy or cultured mammalian kidney cells) that contains a percentage of cells capable of producing EPO that is greater than the percentage of cells capable of producing EPO in the starting population. For example, the term âB4â is a cell population derived from a starting kidney cell population that contains a greater percentage of EPO-producing cells, glomerular cells, and vascular cells as compared to the starting population. The cell populations may be enriched for one or more cell types and depleted of one or more other cell types. For example, an enriched EPO-producing cell population may be enriched for interstitial fibroblasts and depleted of tubular cells and collecting duct epithelial cells relative to the interstitial fibroblasts and tubular cells in a non-enriched cell population, i.e. the starting cell population from which the enriched cell population is derived. In all embodiments citing EPO-enriched or âB4â populations, the enriched cell populations are heterogeneous populations of cells containing cells that can produce EPO in an oxygen-regulated manner, as demonstrated by oxygen-tunable EPO expression from the endogenous native EPO gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In another aspect, an enriched renal cell population, which contains a greater percentage of a specific cell type, e.g., vascular, glomerular, or endocrine cells, than the percentage of that cell type in the starting population, may also lack or be deficient in one or more specific cell types, e.g., vascular, glomerular, or endocrine cells, as compared to a starting kidney cell population derived from a healthy individual or subject. For example, the term âB4â²,â or B4 prime,â in one aspect, is a cell population derived from a starting kidney cell population that lacks or is deficient in one or more cell types, e.g., vascular, glomerular or endocrine, depending on the disease state of the starting specimen, as compared to a healthy individual. In one embodiment, the B4â² cell population is derived from a subject having chronic kidney disease. In one embodiment, the B4â² cell population is derived from a subject having focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). In another embodiment, the B4â² cell population is derived from a subject having autoimmune glomerulonephritis. In another aspect, B4â² is a cell population derived from a starting cell population including all cell types, e.g., vascular, glomerular, or endocrine cells, which is later depleted of or made deficient in one or more cell types, e.g., vascular, glomerular, or endocrine cells. In yet another aspect, B4â² is a cell population derived from a starting cell population including all cell types, e.g., vascular, glomerular, or endocrine cells, in which one or more specific cell types e.g., vascular, glomerular, or endocrine cells, is later enriched. For example, in one embodiment, a B4â² cell population may be enriched for vascular cells but depleted of glomerular and/or endocrine cells. In another embodiment, a B4â² cell population may be enriched for glomerular cells but depleted of vascular and/or endocrine cells. In another embodiment, a B4â² cell population may be enriched for endocrine cells but depleted of vascular and/or glomerular cells. In another embodiment, a B4â² cell population may be enriched for vascular and endocrine cells but depleted of glomerular cells. In preferred embodiments, the B4â² cell population, alone or admixed with another enriched cell population, e.g., B2 and/or 83, retains therapeutic properties. A B4â² cell population, for example, is described herein in the Examples, e.g., Examples 11-13.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In another aspect, an enriched cell population may also refer to a cell population derived from a starting kidney cell population as discussed above that contains a percentage of cells expressing one or more vascular, glomerular and proximal tubular markers with some EPO-producing cells that is greater than the percentage of cells expressing one or more vascular, glomerular and proximal tubular markers with some EPO-producing cells in the starting population. For example, the term âB3â refers to a cell population derived from a starting kidney cell population that contains a greater percentage of proximal tubular cells as well as vascular and glomerular cells as compared to the starting population. In one embodiment, the B3 cell population contains a greater percentage of proximal tubular cells as compared to the starting population but a lesser percentage of proximal tubular cells as compared to the B2 cell population. In another embodiment, the B3 cell population contains a greater percentage of vascular and glomerular cells markers with some EPO-producing cells as compared to the starting population but a lesser percentage of vascular and glomerular cells markers with some EPO-producing cells as compared to the B4 cell population.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In another aspect, an enriched cell population may also refer to a cell population derived from a starting kidney cell population as discussed above that contains a percentage of cells expressing one or more tubular cell markers that is greater than the percentage of cells expressing one or more tubular cell markers in the starting population. For example, the term âB2â refers to a cell population derived from a starting kidney cell population that contains a greater percentage of tubular cells as compared to the starting population. In addition, a cell population enriched for cells that express one or more tubular cell markers (or âB2â) may contain some epithelial cells from the collecting duct system. Although the cell population enriched for cells that express one or more tubular cell markers (or âB2â) is relatively depleted of EPO-producing cells, glomerular cells, and vascular cells, the enriched population may contain a smaller percentage of these cells (EPO-producing, glomerular, and vascular) in comparison to the starting population. In general, a heterogeneous cell population is depleted of one or more cell types such that the depleted cell population contains a lesser proportion of the cell type(s) relative to the proportion of the cell type(s) contained in the heterogeneous cell population prior to depletion. The cell types that may be depleted are any type of kidney cell. For example, in certain embodiments, the cell types that may be depleted include cells with large granularity of the collecting duct and tubular system having a density of &lt;about 1.045 g/ml, referred to as âB1â. In certain other embodiments, the cell types that may be depleted include debris and small cells of low granularity and viability having a density of &gt;about 1.095 g/ml, referred to as âB5â. In some embodiments, the cell population enriched for tubular cells is relatively depleted of all of the following: âB1â, âB5â, oxygen-tunable EPO-expressing cells, glomerular cells, and vascular cells.</p>

Non-hypoxic conditions are referred to herein as normal or normoxic culture conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The term âoxygen-tunableâ as used herein refers to the ability of cells to modulate gene expression (up or down) based on the amount of oxygen available to the cells. âHypoxia-inducibleâ refers to the upregulation of gene expression in response to a reduction in oxygen tension (regardless of the pre-induction or starting oxygen tension).</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The term âbiomaterialâ as used herein refers to a natural or synthetic biocompatible material that is suitable for introduction into living tissue. A natural biomaterial is a material that is made by or originates from a living system. Synthetic biomaterials are materials which are not made by or do not originate from a living system. The biomaterials disclosed herein may be a combination of natural and synthetic biocompatible materials. As used herein, biomaterials include, for example, polymeric matrices and scaffolds. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the biomaterial(s) may be configured in various forms, for example, as porous foam, gels, liquids, beads, solids, and may comprise one or more natural or synthetic biocompatible materials.

      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The term âmodified releaseâ or the equivalent terms âcontrolled releaseâ, âdelayed releaseâ, or âslow releaseâ refer to formulations that release an active agent, such as bioactive cells, over time or at more than one point in time following administration to an individual. Modified release of an active agent, which can occur over a range of desired times, e.g., minutes, hours, days, weeks, or longer, depending upon the formulation, is in contrast to standard formulations in which substantially the entire dosage unit is available immediately after administration. For tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications, preferred modified release formulations provide for the release of an active agent at multiple time points following local administration (e.g., administration of an active agent directly to a solid organ). For example, a modified release formulation of bioactive cells would provide an initial release of cells immediately at the time of administration and a later, second release of cells at a later time. The time delay for the second release of an active agent may be minutes, hours, or days after the initial administration. In general, the period of time for delay of release corresponds to the period of time that it takes for a biomaterial carrier of the active agent to lose it structural integrity. The delayed release of an active agent begins as such integrity begins to degrade and is completed by the time integrity fails completely. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate other suitable mechanisms of release.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The term âanemiaâ as used herein refers to a deficit in red blood cell number and/or hemoglobin levels due to inadequate production of functional EPO protein by the EPO-producing cells of a subject, and/or inadequate release of EPO protein into systemic circulation, and/or the inability of erythroblasts in the bone marrow to respond to EPO protein. A subject with anemia is unable to maintain erythroid homeostasis. In general, anemia can occur with a decline or loss of kidney function (e.g., chronic renal failure), anemia associated with relative EPO deficiency, anemia associated with congestive heart failure, anemia associated with myelo-suppressive therapy such as chemotherapy or anti-viral therapy (e.g., AZT), anemia associated with non-myeloid cancers, anemia associated with viral infections such as HIV, and anemia of chronic diseases such as autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), liver disease, and multi-organ system failure.</p>

Kidney disease may originate in the kidney or may be secondary to a variety of conditions, including (but not limited to) heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, autoimmune disease, or liver disease. Kidney disease may be a condition of chronic renal failure that develops after an acute injury to the kidney. For example, injury to the kidney by ischemia and/or exposure to toxicants may cause acute renal failure; incomplete recovery after acute kidney injury may lead to the development of chronic renal failure.</p>

      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">As described in Presnell et al. WO/2010/056328, it has been found that the B2 and B4 cell preparations are capable of expressing higher molecular weight species of hyaluronic acid (HA) both in vitro and in vivo, through the actions of hyaluronic acid synthase-2 (HAS-2)âa marker that is enriched more specifically in the B2 cell population. Treatment with B2 in a 5/6 Nx model was shown to reduce fibrosis, concomitant with strong expression HAS-2 expression in vivo and the expected production of high-molecular-weight HA within the treated tissue. Notably, the 5/6 Nx model left untreated resulted in fibrosis with limited detection of HAS-2 and little production of high-molecular-weight HA. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is hypothesized that this anti-inflammatory high-molecular weight species of HA produced predominantly by B2 (and to some degree by B4) acts synergistically with the cell preparations in the reduction of renal fibrosis and in the aid of renal regeneration. Accordingly, the instant disclosure includes formulations containing the bioactive renal cells described herein along with a biomaterial comprising hyaluronic acid. Also contemplated by the instant disclosure is the provision of a biomaterial component of the regenerative stimulus via direct production or stimulation of production by the implanted cells.</p>

In one embodiment, the EPO expression is induced when the cell population is cultured under conditions where the cells are subjected to a reduction in available oxygen levels in the culture system as compared to a cell population cultured at normal atmospheric (Ë21%) levels of available oxygen. In one embodiment, EPO-producing cells cultured in lower oxygen conditions express greater levels of EPO relative to EPO-producing cells cultured at normal oxygen conditions. In general, the culturing of cells at reduced levels of available oxygen (also referred to as hypoxic culture conditions) means that the level of reduced oxygen is reduced relative to the culturing of cells at normal atmospheric levels of available oxygen (also referred to as normal or normoxic culture conditions). In one embodiment, hypoxic cell culture conditions include culturing cells at about less than 1% oxygen, about less than 2% oxygen, about less than 3% oxygen, about less than 4% oxygen, or about less than 5% oxygen.

In one embodiment, the perfusion conditions include transient, intermittent, or continuous fluid flow (perfusion). In one embodiment, the EPO expression is mechanically-induced when the media in which the cells are cultured is intermittently or continuously circulated or agitated in such a manner that dynamic forces are transferred to the cells via the flow. In one embodiment, the cells subjected to the transient, intermittent, or continuous fluid flow are cultured in such a manner that they are present as three-dimensional structures in or on a material that provides framework and/or space for such three-dimensional structures to form. In one embodiment, the cells are cultured on porous beads and subjected to intermittent or continuous fluid flow by means of a rocking platform, orbiting platform, or spinner flask. In another embodiment, the cells are cultured on three-dimensional scaffolding and placed into a device whereby the scaffold is stationary and fluid flows directionally through or across the scaffolding.

The B5 cell population is comprised of debris and small cells of low granularity and viability and having a buoyant density greater than about 1.091 g/ml.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0116">Methods of Isolating and Culturing Cell Populations</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0117">In one aspect, the formulations of the present disclosure contain cell populations that have been isolated and/or cultured from kidney tissue. Methods are provided herein for separating and isolating the renal cellular components, e.g., enriched cell populations that will be used in the formulations for therapeutic use, including the treatment of kidney disease, anemia, EPO deficiency, tubular transport deficiency, and glomerular filtration deficiency. In one embodiment, the cell populations are isolated from freshly digested, i.e., mechanically or enzymatically digested, kidney tissue or from heterogeneous in vitro cultures of mammalian kidney cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0118">The formulations may contain heterogeneous mixtures of renal cells that have been cultured in hypoxic culture conditions prior to separation on a density gradient provides for enhanced distribution and composition of cells in both B4, including B4â², and B2 and/or B3 fractions. The enrichment of oxygen-dependent cells in B4 from B2 was observed for renal cells isolated from both diseased and non-diseased kidneys. Without wishing to be bound by theory, this may be due to one or more of the following phenomena: 1) selective survival, death, or proliferation of specific cellular components during the hypoxic culture period; 2) alterations in cell granularity and/or size in response to the hypoxic culture, thereby effecting alterations in buoyant density and subsequent localization during density gradient separation; and 3) alterations in cell gene/protein expression in response to the hypoxic culture period, thereby resulting in differential characteristics of the cells within any given fraction of the gradient. Thus, in one embodiment, the formulations contain cell populations enriched for tubular cells, e.g., B2, are hypoxia-resistant.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0119">Exemplary techniques for separating and isolating the cell populations include separation on a density gradient based on the differential specific gravity of different cell types contained within the population of interest. The specific gravity of any given cell type can be influenced by the degree of granularity within the cells, the intracellular volume of water, and other factors. In one aspect, the present disclosure provides optimal gradient conditions for isolation of the cell preparations, e.g., B2 and B4, including B4â², across multiple species including, but not limited to, human, canine, and rodent. In a preferred embodiment, a density gradient is used to obtain a novel enriched population of tubular cells fraction, i.e., B2 cell population, derived from a heterogeneous population of renal cells. In one embodiment, a density gradient is used to obtain a novel enriched population of EPO-producing cells fraction, i.e., B4 cell population, derived from a heterogeneous population of renal cells. In other embodiments, a density gradient is used to obtain enriched subpopulations of tubular cells, glomerular cells, and endothelial cells of the kidney. In one embodiment, both the EPO-producing and the tubular cells are separated from the red blood cells and cellular debris. In one embodiment, the EPO-producing, glomerular, and vascular cells are separated from other cell types and from red blood cells and cellular debris, while a subpopulation of tubular cells and collecting duct cells are concomitantly separated from other cell types and from red blood cells and cellular debris. In one other embodiment, the endocrine, glomerular, and/or vascular cells are separated from other cell types and from red blood cells and cellular debris, while a subpopulation of tubular cells and collecting duct cells are concomitantly separated from other cell types and from red blood cells and cellular debris.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0120">In one aspect, the formulations of the present disclosure contain cell populations generated by using, in part, the OPTIPREPÂ® (Axis-Shield) density gradient medium, comprising 60% nonionic iodinated compound iodixanol in water, based on certain key features described below. One of skill in the art, however, will recognize that any density gradient or other means, e.g., immunological separation using cell surface markers known in the art, comprising necessary features for isolating the cell populations of the instant disclosure may be used. It should also be recognized by one skilled in the art that the same cellular features that contribute to separation of cellular subpopulations via density gradients (size and granularity) can be exploited to separate cellular subpopulations via flow cytometry (forward scatter=a reflection of size via flow cytometry, and side scatter=a reflection of granularity). Importantly, the density gradient medium should have low toxicity towards the specific cells of interest. While the density gradient medium should have low toxicity toward the specific cells of interest, the instant disclosure contemplates the use of gradient mediums which play a role in the selection process of the cells of interest. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it appears that the cell populations disclosed herein recovered by the gradient comprising iodixanol are iodixanol-resistant, as there is an appreciable loss of cells between the loading and recovery steps, suggesting that exposure to iodixanol under the conditions of the gradient leads to elimination of certain cells. The cells appearing in the specific bands after the iodixanol gradient are resistant to any untoward effects of iodixanol and/or density gradient exposure. Accordingly, the use of additional contrast media which are mild to moderate nephrotoxins in the isolation and/or selection of the cell populations for the formulations described herein is also contemplated. In addition, the density gradient medium should also not bind to proteins in human plasma or adversely affect key functions of the cells of interest.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">In another aspect, the present disclosure provides formulations containing cell populations that have been enriched and/or depleted of kidney cell types using fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS). In one embodiment, kidney cell types may be enriched and/or depleted using BD FACSAriaâ¢ or equivalent.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">In another aspect, the formulations contain cell populations that have been enriched and/or depleted of kidney cell types using magnetic cell sorting. In one embodiment, kidney cell types may be enriched and/or depleted using the Miltenyi autoMACSÂ® system or equivalent.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">In another aspect, the formulations may include renal cell populations that have been subject to three-dimensional culturing. In one aspect, the methods of culturing the cell populations are via continuous perfusion. In one embodiment, the cell populations cultured via three-dimensional culturing and continuous perfusion demonstrate greater cellularity and interconnectivity when compared to cell populations cultured statically. In another embodiment, the cell populations cultured via three dimensional culturing and continuous perfusion demonstrate greater expression of EPO, as well as enhanced expression of renal tubule-associate genes such as e-cadherin when compared to static cultures of such cell populations. In yet another embodiment, the cell populations cultured via continuous perfusion demonstrate greater levels of glucose and glutamine consumption when compared to cell populations cultured statically.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0124">As described herein, low or hypoxic oxygen conditions may be used in the methods to prepare the cell populations for the formulations provided for herein. However, the methods of preparing cell populations may be used without the step of low oxygen conditioning. In one embodiment, normoxic conditions may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other methods of isolation and culturing known in the art may be used for the cells described herein.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="1">3. BIOMATERIALS</heading>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0126">A variety of biomaterials may be combined with an active agent to provide the therapeutic formulations of the present disclosure. The biomaterials may be in any suitable shape (e.g., beads) or form (e.g., liquid, gel, etc.). As described in Bertram et al. U.S. Published Application 20070276507 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), polymeric matrices or scaffolds may be shaped into any number of desirable configurations to satisfy any number of overall system, geometry or space restrictions. In one embodiment, the matrices or scaffolds of the present disclosure may be three-dimensional and shaped to conform to the dimensions and shapes of an organ or tissue structure. For example, in the use of the polymeric scaffold for treating kidney disease, anemia, EPO deficiency, tubular transport deficiency, or glomerular filtration deficiency, a three-dimensional (3-D) matrix may be used. A variety of differently shaped 3-D scaffolds may be used. Naturally, the polymeric matrix may be shaped in different sizes and shapes to conform to differently sized patients. The polymeric matrix may also be shaped in other ways to accommodate the special needs of the patient. In another embodiment, the polymeric matrix or scaffold may be a biocompatible, porous polymeric scaffold. The scaffolds may be formed from a variety of synthetic or naturally-occurring materials including, but not limited to, open-cell polylactic acid (OPLAÂ®), cellulose ether, cellulose, cellulosic ester, fluorinated polyethylene, phenolic, poly-4-methylpentene, polyacrylonitrile, polyamide, polyamideimide, polyacrylate, polybenzoxazole, polycarbonate, polycyanoarylether, polyester, polyestercarbonate, polyether, polyetheretherketone, polyetherimide, polyetherketone, polyethersulfone, polyethylene, polyfluoroolefin, polyimide, polyolefin, polyoxadiazole, polyphenylene oxide, polyphenylene sulfide, polypropylene, polystyrene, polysulfide, polysulfone, polytetrafluoroethylene, polythioether, polytriazole, polyurethane, polyvinyl, polyvinylidene fluoride, regenerated cellulose, silicone, urea-formaldehyde, collagens, gelatin, alginate, laminins, fibronectin, silk, elastin, alginate, hyaluronic acid, agarose, or copolymers or physical blends thereof. Scaffolding configurations may range from liquid suspensions to soft porous scaffolds to rigid, shape-holding porous scaffolds. In one embodiment, the configuration is the liquid form of a solution that is capable of becoming a hydrogel.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0127">Hydrogels may be formed from a variety of polymeric materials and are useful in a variety of biomedical applications. Hydrogels can be described physically as three-dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers. Depending on the type of hydrogel, they contain varying percentages of water, but altogether do not dissolve in water. Despite their high water content, hydrogels are capable of additionally binding great volumes of liquid due to the presence of hydrophilic residues. Hydrogels swell extensively without changing their gelatinous structure. The basic physical features of hydrogel can be specifically modified, according to the properties of the polymers used and the additional special equipments of the products.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0128">Preferably, the hydrogel is made of a polymer, a biologically derived material, a synthetically derived material or combinations thereof, that is biologically inert and physiologically compatible with mammalian tissues. The hydrogel material preferably does not induce an inflammatory response. Examples of other materials which can be used to form a hydrogel include (a) modified alginates, (b) polysaccharides (e.g. gellan gum and carrageenans) which gel by exposure to monovalent cations, (c) polysaccharides (e.g., hyaluronic acid) that are very viscous liquids or are thixotropic and form a gel over time by the slow evolution of structure, (d) gelatin or collagen, and (e) polymeric hydrogel precursors (e.g., polyethylene oxide-polypropylene glycol block copolymers and proteins). U.S. Pat. No. 6,224,893 B1 provides a detailed description of the various polymers, and the chemical properties of such polymers, that are suitable for making hydrogels.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0129">Scaffolding or biomaterial characteristics may enable cells to attach and interact with the scaffolding or biomaterial material, and/or may provide porous spaces into which cells can be entrapped. In one embodiment, the porous scaffolds or biomaterials allow for the addition or deposition of one or more populations or admixtures of cells on a biomaterial configured as a porous scaffold (e.g., by attachment of the cells) and/or within the pores of the scaffold (e.g., by entrapment of the cells). In another embodiment, the scaffolds or biomaterials allow or promote for cell:cell and/or cell:biomaterial interactions within the scaffold to form constructs as described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0130">In one embodiment, the biomaterial is comprised of hyaluronic acid (HA) in hydrogel form, containing HA molecules ranging in size from 5.1 kDA to &gt;2Ã10<sup>6 </sup>kDa. In another embodiment, the biomaterial is comprised of hyaluronic acid in porous foam form, also containing HA molecules ranging in size from 5.1 kDA to &gt;2Ã10<sup>6 </sup>kDa. In yet another embodiment, the biomaterial is comprised of a poly-lactic acid (PLA)-based foam, having an open-cell structure and pore size of about 50 microns to about 300 microns. In yet another embodiment, the specific cell populations, preferentially B2 but also B4, provide directly and/or stimulate synthesis of high molecular weight Hyaluronic Acid through Hyaluronic Acid Synthase-2 (HAS-2), especially after intra-renal implantation.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0131">The biomaterials described herein may also be designed or adapted to respond to certain external conditions, e.g., in vitro or in vivo. In one embodiment, the biomaterials are temperature-sensitive (e.g., either in vitro or in vivo). In another embodiment, the biomaterials are adapted to respond to exposure to enzymatic degradation (e.g., either in vitro or in vivo). The biomaterials' response to external conditions can be fine tuned as described herein. Temperature sensitivity of the formulation described can be varied by adjusting the percentage of a biomaterial in the formulation. For example, the percentage of gelatin in a solution can be adjusted to modulate the temperature sensitivity of the gelatin in the final formulation (e.g., liquid, gel, beads, etc.). Alternatively, biomaterials may be chemically cross-linked to provide greater resistance to enzymatic degradation. For instance, a carbodiimide crosslinker may be used to chemically crosslink gelatin beads thereby providing a reduced susceptibility to endogenous enzymes.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0132">In one aspect, the response by the biomaterial to external conditions concerns the loss of structural integrity of the biomaterial. Although temperature-sensitivity and resistance to enzymatic degradation are provided above, other mechanisms exist by which the loss of material integrity may occur in different biomaterials. These mechanisms may include, but are not limited to thermodynamic (e.g., a phase transition such as melting, diffusion (e.g., diffusion of an ionic crosslinker from a biomaterial into the surrounding tissue)), chemical, enzymatic, pH (e.g., pH-sensitive liposomes), ultrasound, and photolabile (light penetration). The exact mechanism by which the biomaterial loses structural integrity will vary but typically the mechanism is triggered either at the time of implantation or post-implantation.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0133">Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other types of synthetic or naturally-occurring materials known in the art may be used to form scaffolds as described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0134">In one aspect, the constructs as described herein are made from the above-referenced scaffolds or biomaterials.</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">4. CONSTRUCTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0135">In one aspect, the disclosure provides formulations that contain implantable constructs having one or more of the cell populations described herein for the treatment of kidney disease, anemia, or EPO deficiency in a subject in need. In one embodiment, the construct is made up of a biocompatible material or biomaterial, scaffold or matrix composed of one or more synthetic or naturally-occurring biocompatible materials and one or more cell populations or admixtures of cells described herein deposited on or embedded in a surface of the scaffold by attachment and/or entrapment. In certain embodiments, the construct is made up of a biomaterial and one or more cell populations or admixtures of cells described herein coated with, deposited on, deposited in, attached to, entrapped in, embedded in, seeded, or combined with the biomaterial component(s). Any of the cell populations described herein, including enriched cell populations or admixtures thereof, may be used in combination with a matrix to form a construct.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0136">In one aspect, the formulation contains constructs that are made up of biomaterials designed or adapted to respond to external conditions as described herein. As a result, the nature of the association of the cell population with the biomaterial in a construct will change depending upon the external conditions. For example, a cell population's association with a temperature-sensitive biomaterial varies with temperature. In one embodiment, the construct contains a cell population and biomaterial having a substantially solid state at about 8Â° C. or lower and a substantially liquid state at about ambient temperature or above, wherein the cell population is suspended in the biomaterial at about 8Â° C. or lower.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0137">However, the cell population is substantially free to move throughout the volume of the biomaterial at about ambient temperature or above. Having the cell population suspended in the substantially solid phase at a lower temperature provides stability advantages for the cells, such as for anchorage-dependent cells, as compared to cells in a fluid. Moreover, having cells suspended in the substantially solid state provides one or more of the following benefits: i) prevents settling of the cells, ii) allows the cells to remain anchored to the biomaterial in a suspended state; iii) allows the cells to remain more uniformly dispersed throughout the volume of the biomaterial; iv) prevents the formation of cell aggregates; and v) provides better protection for the cells during storage and transportation of the formulation. A formulation that can retain such features leading up to the administration to a subject is advantageous at least because the overall health of the cells in the formulation will be better and a more uniform and consistent dosage of cells will be administered.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0138">In another embodiment, the deposited cell population or cellular component of the construct is a first kidney cell population enriched for oxygen-tunable EPO-producing cells. In another embodiment, the first kidney cell population contains glomerular and vascular cells in addition to the oxygen-tunable EPO-producing cells. In one embodiment, the first kidney cell population is a B4â² cell population. In one other embodiment, the deposited cell population or cellular component(s) of the construct includes both the first enriched renal cell population and a second renal cell population. In some embodiments, the second cell population is not enriched for oxygen-tunable EPO producing cells. In another embodiment, the second cell population is enriched for renal tubular cells. In another embodiment, the second cell population is enriched for renal tubular cells and contains collecting duct epithelial cells. In other embodiments, the renal tubular cells are characterized by the expression of one or more tubular cell markers that may include, without limitation, megalin, cubilin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2 (HAS2), Vitamin D3 25-Hydroxylase (CYP2D25), N-cadherin (Ncad), E-cadherin (Ecad), Aquaporin-1 (Aqp1), Aquaporin-2 (Aqp2), RAB17, member RAS oncogene family (Rab17), GATA binding protein 3 (Gata3), FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 4 (Fxyd4), solute carrier family 9 (sodium/hydrogen exchanger), member 4 (Slc9a4), aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family, member B1 (Aldh3b1), aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A3 (Aldh1a3), and Calpain-8 (Capn8).</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0139">In one embodiment, the cell populations deposited on or combined with biomaterials or scaffolds to form constructs are derived from a variety of sources, such as autologous sources. Non-autologous sources are also suitable for use, including without limitation, allogeneic, or syngeneic (autogeneic or isogeneic) sources.</p>

Multiplexed immunoassays such as those available from Rules Based Medicine or Meso Scale Discovery may also be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0148">In one aspect, a method of detecting the presence of two or more biomarkers in a heterogeneous renal cell sample is provided, the method comprising contacting the sample with an antibody directed to a biomarker under conditions permissive for binding of the antibody to its cognate ligand (i.e., biomarker), and detecting the presence of the bound antibody, e.g., by detecting whether a complex is formed between the antibody and the biomarker.

In certain embodiments, a biomarker is detected by monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0151">In one embodiment, an detectable label comprises a radioactive atom to form a radioconjugate. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugates.

      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0153">The detection can be carried out by any suitable method, for example, those based on immunofluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, fiber-optic scanning cytometry, or laser scanning cytometry.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0154">In some embodiments, the expression of a biomarker in a cell is determined by evaluating mRNA in a cell. Methods for the evaluation of mRNAs in cells are well known and include, for example, hybridization assays using complementary DNA probes (such as in situ hybridization using labeled riboprobes specific for the one or more genes, Northern blot and related techniques) and various nucleic acid amplification assays (such as RT-PCR using complementary primers specific for one or more of the genes, and other amplification type detection methods, such as, for example, branched DNA, SISBA, TMA and the like). In some embodiments, the expression of a biomarker in a test sample is compared to a reference sample. For example, the test sample may be a diseased tissue sample and the reference sample may be from normal tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0155">Samples from mammals can be conveniently assayed for mRNAs using Northern, dot blot or PCR analysis. In addition, such methods can include one or more steps that allow one to determine the levels of target mRNA in a biological sample (e.g., by simultaneously examining the levels a comparative control mRNA sequence of a âhousekeepingâ gene such as an actin family member). Optionally, the sequence of the amplified target cDNA can be determined.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0156">Optional methods include protocols which examine or detect mRNAs, such as target mRNAs, in a tissue or cell sample by microarray technologies. Using nucleic acid microarrays, test and control mRNA samples from test and control samples are reverse transcribed and labeled to generate cDNA probes. The probes are then hybridized to an array of nucleic adds immobilized on a solid support. The array is configured such that the sequence and position of each member of the array is known. For example, a selection of genes whose expression correlates with a cell population capable of eliciting a regenerative response may be arrayed on a solid support. Hybridization of a labeled probe with a particular array member indicates that the sample from which the probe was derived expresses that gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0157">According to some embodiments, presence and/or level/amount is measured by observing protein expression levels of an aforementioned gene. In certain embodiments, the method comprises contacting the biological sample with antibodies to a biomarker described herein under conditions permissive for binding of the biomarker, and detecting whether a complex is formed between the antibodies and biomarker.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0158">In certain embodiments, the presence and/or level/amount of biomarker proteins in a sample are examined using IHC and staining protocols. IHC staining of cells has been shown to be a reliable method of determining or detecting the presence of proteins in a sample. In one aspect, level of biomarker is determined using a method comprising: (a) performing IHC analysis of a sample (such as a renal cell sample) with an antibody; and b) determining level of a biomarker in the sample. In some embodiments, IHC staining intensity is determined relative to a reference value.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0159">IHC may be performed in combination with additional techniques such as morphological staining and/or fluorescence in-situ hybridization. Two general methods of IHC are available; direct and indirect assays. According to the first assay, binding of antibody to the target antigen is determined directly. This direct assay uses a labeled reagent, such as a fluorescent tag or an enzyme-labeled primary antibody, which can be visualized without further antibody interaction. In a typical indirect assay, unconjugated primary antibody binds to the antigen and then a labeled secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody. Where the secondary antibody is conjugated to an enzymatic label, a chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate is added to provide visualization of the antigen. Signal amplification occurs because several secondary antibodies may react with different epitopes on the primary antibody.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0160">The primary and/or secondary antibody used for IHC typically will be labeled with a detectable moiety. Numerous labels are available which can be generally grouped into the following categories: (a) Radioisotopes, such as <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>3</sup>H, and <sup>131</sup>I; (b) colloidal gold particles; (c) fluorescent labels including, but are not limited to, rare earth chelates (europium chelates), Texas Red, rhodamine, fluorescein, dansyl, Lissamine, umbelliferone, phycocrytherin, phycocyanin, or commercially available fluorophores such SPECTRUM ORANGE7 and SPECTRUM GREEN7 and/or derivatives of any one or more of the above; (d) various enzyme-substrate labels are available and U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149 provides a review of some of these. Examples of enzymatic labels include luciferases (e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase; U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, malate dehydrogenase, urease, peroxidase such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase, O-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases (e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), heterocyclic oxidases (such as uricase and xanthine oxidase), lactoperoxidase, microperoxidase, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0161">Examples of enzyme-substrate combinations include, for example, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with hydrogen peroxidase as a substrate; alkaline phosphatase (AP) with para-Nitrophenyl phosphate as chromogenic substrate; and Î²-D-galactosidase (Î²-D-Gal) with a chromogenic substrate (e.g., p-nitrophenyl-p-D-galactosidase) or fluorogenic substrate (e.g., 4-methylumbelliferyl-Î²-D-galactosidase). For a general review of these, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,275,149 and 4,318,980.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0162">In an exemplary method, the sample may be contacted with an antibody specific for the biomarker under conditions sufficient for an antibody-biomarker complex to form, and then detecting the complex. The presence of the biomarker may be detected in a number of ways, such as by Western blotting and ELISA procedures for assaying a wide variety of tissues and samples, including plasma or serum. A wide range of immunoassay techniques using such an assay format are available, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,016,043, 4,424,279 and 4,018,653. These include both single-site and two-site or âsandwichâ assays of the non-competitive types, as well as in the traditional competitive binding assays. These assays also include direct binding of a labeled antibody to a target biomarker.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0163">The presence and/or level/amount of a selected biomarker in a tissue or cell sample may also be examined by way of functional or activity-based assays. For instance, if the biomarker is an enzyme, one may conduct assays known in the art to determine or detect the presence of the given enzymatic activity in the tissue or cell sample.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0164">In certain embodiments, the samples are normalized for both differences in the amount of the biomarker assayed and variability in the quality of the samples used, and variability between assay runs. Such normalization may be accomplished by detecting and incorporating the level of certain normalizing biomarkers, including well known housekeeping genes, such as ACTB. Alternatively, normalization can be based on the mean or median signal of all of the assayed genes or a large subset thereof (global normalization approach). On a gene-by-gene basis, measured normalized amount of a subject tumor mRNA or protein is compared to the amount found in a reference set. Normalized expression levels for each mRNA or protein per tested tumor per subject can be expressed as a percentage of the expression level measured in the reference set. The presence and/or expression level/amount measured in a particular subject sample to be analyzed will fall at some percentile within this range, which can be determined by methods well known in the art.</p>

In one embodiment, the beads are crosslinked. Crosslinking may be achieved using any suitable crosslinking agent known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as, for example, carbodiimides; aldehydes (e.g. furfural, acrolein, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, glyceryl aldehyde), succinimide-based crosslinkers {Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3), Disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG), Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), Dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), Ethylene glycolbis(sulfosuccinimidylsuccinate), Ethylene glycolbis(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS), Bis(Sulfosuccinimidyl) glutarate (BS2G), Disuccinimidyl tartrate (DST)}; epoxides (Ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, 1,4 Butanediol diglycidyl ether); saccharides (glucose and aldose sugars); sulfonic acids and p-toluene sulfonic acid; carbonyldiimidazole; genipin; imines; ketones; diphenylphosphorylazide (DDPA); terephthaloyl chloride; cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate; microbial transglutaminase; and hydrogen peroxide. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate other suitable crosslinking agents and crosslinking methods for use in the present methods, formulations and/or treatments.</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0219">In one embodiment, the beads are carbodiimide-crosslinked beads. The carbodiimide-crosslinked beads may be crosslinked with a carbodiimide selected from the group consisting of 1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), DCC-N,Nâ²-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and N,Nâ²-Diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIPC). Beads treated with lower concentration of EDC were expected to have a higher number of free primary amines, while samples treated with high concentrations of crosslinker would have most of the primary amines engaged in amide bonds. The intensity of the orange color developed by the covalent bonding between the primary amine and picrylsulfonic acid, detectable spectrophotometrically at 335 nm, is proportional to the number of primary amines present in the sample. When normalized per milligram of protein present in the sample, an inverse correlation between the number of free amines present and the initial concentration of EDC used for crosslinking can be observed. This result is indicative of differential bead crosslinking, dictated by the amount of carbodiimide used in the reaction. In general, crosslinked beads exhibit a reduced number of free primary amines as compared to non-crosslinked beads. The number of free primary amines may be detected spectrophotometrically at about 335 nm.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0220">The crosslinked beads have a reduced susceptibility to enzymatic degradation as compared to non-crosslinked biocompatible beads, thereby providing beads with finely tunable in vivo residence times. For example, the cross-linked beads are resistant to endogenous enzymes, such as collagenases. The provision of crosslinked beads is part of a delivery system focused on the development and production of biomaterials that facilitate one or more of: (a) delivery of attached cells to the desired sites and creation of space for regeneration and ingrowth of native tissue and vascular supply; (b) ability to persist at the site long enough to allow cells to establish, function, remodel their microenvironment and secrete their own extracellular matrix (ECM); (c) promotion of integration of the transplanted cells with the surrounding tissue; (d) ability to implant cells in a substantially solid form; (e) short term structural integrity that does not provide a significant barrier to tissue ingrowth or integration of delivered cells/materials with the host tissue; (f) localized in vivo delivery in a substantially solid form thereby preventing dispersion of cells within the tissue during implantation; (g) improved stability and viability of anchorage dependent cells compared to cells suspended in a fluid; and (h) biphasic release profile when cells are delivered i) in a substantially solid form (e.g., attached to beads), and ii) in a substantially liquid form (e.g., suspended in a fluid).</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0221">In one embodiment, the present disclosure provides crosslinked beads containing gelatin. Non-crosslinked gelatin beads are not suitable for a bioactive cell formulation because they rapidly lose integrity and cells dissipate from the injection site. In contrast, highly crosslinked gelatin beads may persist too long at the injection site and may hinder the de-novo ECM secretion, cell integration and tissue regeneration. The present disclosure allows for the in vivo residence time of the crosslinked beads to be finely tuned. In order to tailor the biodegradability of biomaterials, different crosslinker concentrations of carbodiimide are used while the overall reaction conditions were kept constant for all samples. For example, the enzymatic susceptibility of carbodiimide-crosslinked beads can be finely tuned by varying the concentration of crosslinking agent from about zero to about 1M. In some embodiments, the concentration is about 5 mM, about 6 mM, about 7 mM, about 8 mM, about 9 mM, about 10 mM, about 11 mM, about 12 mM, about 13 mM, about 14 mM, about 15 mM, about 16 mM, about 17 mM, about 18 mM, about 19 mM, about 20 mM, about 21 mM, about 22 mM, about 23 mM, about 24 mM, about 25 mM, about 26 mM, about 27 mM, about 28 mM, about 29 mM, about 30 mM, about 31 mM, about 32 mM, about 33 mM, about 34 mM, about 35 mM, about 36 mM, about 37 mM, about 38 mM, about 39 mM, about 40 mM, about 41 mM, about 42 mM, about 43 mM, about 44 mM, about 45 mM, about 46 mM, about 47 mM, about 48 mM, about 49 mM, about 50 mM, about 55 mM, about 60 mM, about 65 mM, about 70 mM, about 75 mM, about 80 mM, about 85 mM, about 90 mM, about 95 mM, or about 100 mM. The crosslinker concentration may also be about 0.15 M, about 0.2 M, about 0.25 M, about 0.3 M, about 0.35 M, about 0.4 M, about 0.45 M, about 0.5 M, about 0.55 M, about 0.6 M, about 0.65 M, about 0.7 M, about 0.75 M, about 0.8 M, about 0.85 M, about 0.9 M, about 0.95 M, or about 1 M. In another embodiment, the crosslinking agent is 1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). In one embodiment, the EDC-crosslinked beads are gelatin beads.</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0222">Cross-linked beads may have certain characteristics that favor the seeding, attachment, or encapsulation. For example, the beads may have a porous surface and/or may be substantially hollow. The presence of pores provides an increased cell attachment surface allowing for a greater number of cells to attach as compared to a non-porous or smooth surface. In addition, the pore structure can support host tissue integration with the porous beads supporting the formation of de novo tissue. The beads have a size distribution that can be fitted to a Weibull plot corresponding to the general particle distribution pattern. In one embodiment, the cross-linked beads have an average diameter of less than about 120 Î¼m, about 115 Î¼m, about 110 Î¼m, about 109 Î¼m, about 108 Î¼m, about 107 Î¼m, about 106 Î¼m, about 105 Î¼m, about 104 Î¼m, about 103 Î¼m, about 102 Î¼m, about 101 Î¼m, about 100 Î¼m, about 99 Î¼m, about 98 Î¼m, about 97 Î¼m, about 96 Î¼m, about 95 Î¼m, about 94 Î¼m, about 93 Î¼m, about 92 Î¼m, about 91 Î¼m, or about 90 Î¼m. The characteristics of the cross-linked beads vary depending upon the casting process. For instance, a process in which a stream of air is used to aerosolize a liquid gelatin solution and spray it into liquid nitrogen with a thin layer chromatography reagent sprayer (ACE Glassware) is used to provide beads having the aforementioned characteristics. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that modulating the parameters of the casting process provides the opportunity to tailor different characteristics of the beads, e.g., different size distributions.</p>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0223">The cytocompatibility of the cross-linked beads is assessed in vitro prior to formulation using cell culture techniques in which beads are cultured with cells that correspond to the final bioactive cell formulation. For instance, the beads are cultured with primary renal cells prior to preparation of a bioactive renal cell formulation and live/dead cell assays are used to confirm cytocompatibility. In certain formulations, the biocompatible cross-linked beads are combined with a temperature-sensitive biomaterial in solution at about 5% (w/w) to about 15% (w/w) of the volume of the solution. The cross-linked beads may be present at about 5% (w/w), about 5.5% (w/w), about 6% (w/w), about 6.5% (w/w), about 7% (w/w), about 7.5% (w/w), about 8% (w/w), about 8.5% (w/w), about 9% (w/w), about 9.5% (w/w), about 10% (w/w), about 10.5% (w/w), about 11% (w/w), about 11.5% (w/w), about 12% (w/w), about 12.5% (w/w), about 13% (w/w), about 13.5% (w/w), about 14% (w/w), about 14.5% (w/w), or about 15% (w/w) of the volume of the solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0224">In another aspect, the present disclosure provides formulations that contain biomaterials which degrade over a period time on the order of minutes, hours, or days. This is in contrast to a large body or work focusing on the implantation of solid materials that then slowly degrade over days, weeks, or months.</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0225">In another aspect, the present disclosure provides formulations having biocompatible cross-linked beads seeded with bioactive cells together with a delivery matrix. In one embodiment, the delivery matrix has one or more of the following characteristics: biocompatibility, biodegradeable/bioresorbable, a substantially solid state prior to and during implantation into a subject, loss of structural integrity (substantially solid state) after implantation, and cytocompatible environment to support cellular viability. The delivery matrix's ability to keep implanted particles (e.g., crosslinked beads) spaced out during implantation enhances native tissue ingrowth. If the delivery matrix is absent, then compaction of cellularized beads during implantation can lead to inadequate room for sufficient tissue ingrowth. The delivery matrix facilitates implantation of solid formulations. In addition, the short duration of the structural integrity means that soon after implantation, the matrix does not provide a significant barrier to tissue ingrowth or integration of the delivered cells/materials with host tissue. The delivery matrix provides for localization of the formulation described herein since inserted of a solid unit helps prevent the delivered materials from dispersing within the tissue during implantation. For cell-based formulations, a solid delivery matrix improves stability and viability of anchorage dependent cells compared to cells suspended in a fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0226">In one embodiment, the delivery matrix is a population of biocompatible beads that is not seeded with cells. In another embodiment, the unseeded beads are dispersed throughout and in between the individual cell-seeded beads. The unseeded beads act as âspacer beadsâ between the cell-seeded beads prior to and immediately after transplantation. The spacer beads contain a temperature-sensitive biomaterial having a substantially solid state at a first temperature and a substantially liquid state at a second temperature, wherein the first temperature is lower than the second temperature. For example, the spacer beads contain a biomaterial having a substantially solid state at about ambient temperature or below and a substantially liquid state at about 37Â° C., such as that described herein. In one embodiment, the ambient temperature is about room temperature. In another embodiment, the biomaterial is a gelatin solution. The gelatin solution is present at about 4%, about 4.5%, about 5%, about 5.5%, about 6%, about 6.5%, about 7%, about 7.5%, about 8%, about 8.5%, about 9%, about 9.5%, about 10%, about 10.5%, or about 11%, (w/v). The gelatin solution may be provided in PBS, cell culture media (e.g., DMEM), or another suitable solvent.</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0227">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides formulations that contain biomaterials which are implanted in a substantially solid form (e.g., spacer beads) and then liquefy/melt or otherwise lose structural integrity following implantation into the body. This is in contrast to the significant body of work focusing on the use of materials that can be injected as a liquid, which then solidify in the body.</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0228">The temperature-sensitivity of spacer beads can be assessed in vitro prior to formulation. Spacer beads can be labeled and mixed with unlabeled non-temperature-sensitive beads. The mixture is then incubated at 37Â° C. to observe changes in physical transition. The loss of shape of the labeled temperature-sensitive beads at the higher temperature is observed over time. For example, temperature-sensitive gelatin beads may be made with Alcian blue dye to serve as a marker of physical transition. The blue gelatin beads are mixed with Cultispher S beads (white), loaded into a catheter, then extruded and incubated in 1ÃPBS, pH 7.4, at 37Â° C. The loss of shape of the blue gelatin beads is followed microscopically at different time points. Changes in the physical state of the blue gelatin beads are visible after 30 min becoming more pronounced with prolonged incubation times. The beads do not completely dissipate because of the viscosity of the material.</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0229">The bioactive cell formulations described herein may be used to prepare renal cell-based formulations for injection into the kidney. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the formulations will be suitable for many other types of bioactive cell populations. For example, the present disclosure contemplates formulations for bioactive cells for injection into any solid organ or tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0230">In one aspect, the bioactive cell formulations described herein will contain a set number of cells.

In one embodiment, the dosage of cells for a formulation described herein may be calculated based on the estimated mass or functional mass of the target organ or tissue. In certain embodiments, the bioactive cell formulations contain a dosage corresponding to a number of cells based upon the weight of the host organ that will be the subject of treatment by the formulation. For example, a bioactive renal cell formulation is based upon an average weight of about 150 grams for a human kidney. In one embodiment, the number of cells per gram (g) of kidney is about 600 cells/g to about 7.0Ã10<sup>7 </sup>cells/g. In some embodiments, the number of cells per gram of kidney is about 600 cells/g, about 1000 cells/g, about 1500 cells/g, about 2000 cells/g, about 2500 cells/g, about 3000 cells/g, about 3500 cells/g, about 4000 cells/g, about 4500 cells/g, about 5000 cells/g, about 5500 cells/g, about 6000 cells/g, about 6500 cells/g, about 7000 cells/g, about 7500 cells/g, about 8000 cells/g, about 8500 cells/g, about 9000 cells/g, about 9500 cells/g, or about 10,000 cells/g.</p>

      <p id="p-00234-en" num="0234">A total number of cells may be selected for the formulation and the volume of the formulation may be adjusted to reach the proper dosage.</p>
      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0235">in some embodiments, the formulation may contain a dosage of cells to a subject that is a single dosage or a single dosage plus additional dosages. In other embodiments, the dosages may be provided by way of a construct as described herein. The therapeutically effective amount of the renal cell populations or admixtures of renal cell populations described herein can range from the maximum number of cells that is safely received by the subject to the minimum number of cells necessary for treatment of kidney disease, e.g., stabilization, reduced rate-of-decline, or improvement of one or more kidney functions.</p>
      <p id="p-00236-en" num="0236">The therapeutically effective amount of the renal cell populations or admixtures thereof described herein can be suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Such a carrier includes, but is not limited to basal culture medium plus 1% serum albumin, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, collagen, alginate, hyaluronic acid, fibrin glue, polyethyleneglycol, polyvinylalcohol, carboxymethylcellulose and combinations thereof. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00237-en" num="0237">Accordingly, the disclosure provides a use of a formulation containing renal cell populations or admixtures thereof, for example, the B2 cell population alone or admixed with the B3 and/or B4 or B4â² cell population, for the manufacture of a medicament to treat kidney disease in a subject. In some embodiments, the medicament further comprises recombinant polypeptides, such as growth factors, chemokines or cytokines. In further embodiments, the medicaments comprise a human kidney-derived cell population. The cells used to manufacture the medicaments can be isolated, derived, or enriched using any of the variations provided for the methods described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0238">The renal cell preparation(s), or admixtures thereof, or compositions are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for Intravenous administration, intra-arterial administration or administration within the kidney capsule, for example, are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition can also include a local anesthetic to ameliorate any pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a cryopreserved concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule indicating the quantity of active agent. When the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0239">Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are determined in part by the particular composition being administered, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition. Accordingly, there are a wide variety of suitable formulations of pharmaceutical compositions (see, e.g., Alfonso R Gennaro (ed), Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, formerly Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 20th ed., Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2003, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The pharmaceutical compositions are generally formulated as sterile, substantially isotonic and in full compliance with all Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00240-en" num="0240">One aspect further provides a pharmaceutical formulation, comprising a renal cell preparation, for example, the B2 cell preparation alone or incombination with the B3 and/or B4 or B4â² cell preparation, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, the formulation comprises from 10<sup>4 </sup>to 10<sup>9 </sup>mammalian kidney-derived cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00241-en" num="0241">Modified Release Formulations</p>
      <p id="p-00242-en" num="0242">In one aspect, the formulations of the present disclosure are provided as modified release formulations. In general, the modified release is characterized by an initial release of a first active agent upon administration following by at least one additional, subsequent release of a second active agent. The first and second active agents may be the same or they may be different. In one embodiment, the formulations provide modified release through multiple components in the same formulation. In another embodiment, the modified release formulation contains an active agent as part of a first component that allows the active agent to move freely throughout the volume of the formulation, thereby permitting immediate release at the target site upon administration. The first component may be a temperature-sensitive biomaterial having a substantially liquid phase and a substantially solid phase, wherein the first component is in a substantially liquid phase at the time of administration. In one embodiment, the active agent in the substantially liquid phase such that it is substantially free to move throughout the volume of the formulation, and therefore is immediately released to the target site upon administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00243-en" num="0243">In another embodiment, the modified release formulation has an active agent as part of a second component in which the active agent is attached to, deposited on, coated with, embedded in, seeded upon, or entrapped in the second component, which persists before and after administration to the target site. The second component contains structural elements with which the active agent is able to associate with, thereby preventing immediate release of the active agent from the second component at the time of administration. For example, the second component is provided in a substantially solid form, e.g., biocompatible beads, which may be crosslinked to prevent or delay in vivo enzymatic degradation. In one embodiment, the active agent in the substantially solid phase retains its structural integrity within the formulation before and after administration and therefore it does not immediately release the active agent to the target site upon administration. Suitable carriers for modified release formulations have been described herein but those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate other carriers that are appropriate for use herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00244-en" num="0244">In one embodiment, the formulation provides an initial rapid delivery/release of delivered elements, including cells, nanoparticles, therapeutic molecules, etc. followed by a later delayed release of elements. The formulations of the present disclosure can be designed for such biphasic release profile where the agent to be delivered is provided in both an unattached form (e.g., cells in a solution) and an attached form (e.g., cells together with beads or another suitable carrier). Upon initial administration, the unencumbered agent is provided immediately to the site of delivery while release of the encumbered agent is delayed until structural integrity of the carrier (e.g., beads) fails at which point the previously attached agent is released. As discussed below, other suitable mechanisms of release will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00245-en" num="0245">The time delay for release can be adjusted based upon the nature of the active agent. For example, the time delay for release in a bioactive cell formulation may be on the order of seconds, minutes, hours, or days. In some circumstances, a delay on the order of weeks may be appropriate. For other active agents, such as small or large molecules, the time delay for release in a formulation may be on the order of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months. It is also possible for the formulation to contain different biomaterials that provide different time delay release profiles. For example, a first biomaterial with a first active agent may have a first release time and a second biomaterial with a second active agent may have a second release time. The first and second active agent may be the same or different.</p>
      <p id="p-00246-en" num="0246">As discussed herein, the time period of delayed release may generally correspond to the time period for loss of structural integrity of a biomaterial. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate other mechanisms of delayed release. For example, an active agent may be continually released over time independent of the degradation time of any particular biomaterial, e.g., diffusion of a drug from a polymeric matrix. In addition, bioactive cells can migrate away from a formulation containing a biomaterial and the bioactive cells to native tissue. In one embodiment, bioactive cells migrate off of a biomaterial, e.g., a bead, to the native tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00247-en" num="0247">Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Prolonged absorption of injectable formulations can be brought about by including in the formulation an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or generally known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, J. R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978. Additional methods applicable to the controlled or extended release of polypeptide agents are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,306,406 and 6,346,274, as well as, for example, in U.S. Patent Application Nos. US20020182254 and US20020051808, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

      <p id="p-00248-en" num="0248">The bioactive cell formulations of the present disclosure can be administered alone or in combination with other bioactive components. The formulations are suitable for injection or implantation of incorporated tissue engineering elements to the interior of solid organs to regenerate tissue. In addition, the formulations are used for the injection or implantation of tissue engineering elements to the wall of hollow organs to regenerate tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00249-en" num="0249">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides methods of providing a bioactive cell formulation described herein to a subject in need. In one embodiment, the source of the bioactive cell may be autologous or allogeneic, syngeneic (autogeneic or isogeneic), and any combination thereof. In instances where the source is not autologous, the methods may include the administration of an immunosuppressant agent. Suitable immunosuppressant drugs include, without limitation, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mizoribine, ciclosporin, tacrolimus hydrate, chlorambucil, lobenzarit disodium, auranofin, alprostadil, gusperimus hydrochloride, biosynsorb, muromonab, alefacept, pentostatin, daclizumab, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, leflonomide, basiliximab, dornase Î±, bindarid, cladribine, pimecrolimus, ilodecakin, cedelizumab, efalizumab, everolimus, anisperimus, gavilimomab, faralimomab, clofarabine, rapamycin, siplizumab, saireito, LDP-03, CD4, SR-43551, SK&amp;F-106615, IDEC-114, IDEC-131, FTY-720, TSK-204, LF-080299, A-86281, A-802715, GVH-313, HMR-1279, ZD-7349, IPL-423323, CBP-1011, MT-1345, CNI-1493, CBP-2011, J-695, UP-920, L-732531, ABX-RB2, AP-1903, IDPS, BMS-205820, BMS-224818, CTLA4-1g, ER-49890, ER-38925, ISAtx-247, RDP-58, PNU-156804, UP-1082, TMC-95A, TV-4710, PTR-262-MG, and AGI-1096 (see U.S. Pat. No. 7,563,822). Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate other suitable immunosuppressant drugs.</p>
      <p id="p-00250-en" num="0250">The treatment methods of the subject disclosure involve the delivery of a bioactive cell formulation described herein. In one embodiment, direct administration of cells to the site of intended benefit is preferred. A subject in need may also be treated by in vivo contacting of a native kidney with a bioactive cell formulation described herein together with products secreted from one or more enriched renal cell populations, and/or an admixture or construct containing the same.</p>
      <p id="p-00251-en" num="0251">The step of contacting a native kidney in vivo with secreted products may be accomplished through the use/administration of a formulation containing a population of secreted products from cell culture media, e.g., conditioned media, or by implantation of an enriched cell population, and admixture, or a construct capable of secreting the products in vivo. The step of in vivo contacting provides a regenerative effect to the native kidney.</p>
      <p id="p-00252-en" num="0252">A variety of means for administering cells and/or secreted products to subjects will, in view of this specification, be apparent to those of skill in the art. Such methods include injection of the cells into a target site in a subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00253-en" num="0253">Cells and/or secreted products can be inserted into a delivery device or vehicle, which facilitates introduction by injection or implantation into the subjects. In certain embodiments, the delivery vehicle can include natural materials. In certain other embodiments, the delivery vehicle can include synthetic materials. In one embodiment, the delivery vehicle provides a structure to mimic or appropriately fit into the organ's architecture. In other embodiments, the delivery vehicle is fluid-like in nature. Such delivery devices can include tubes, e.g., catheters, for injecting cells and fluids into the body of a recipient subject. In a preferred embodiment, the tubes additionally have a needle, e.g., a syringe, through which the cells can be introduced into the subject at a desired location. In some embodiments, mammalian kidney-derived cell populations are formulated for administration into a blood vessel via a catheter (where the term âcatheterâ is intended to include any of the various tube-like systems for delivery of substances to a blood vessel). Alternatively, the cells can be inserted into or onto a biomaterial or scaffold, including but not limited to textiles, such as weaves, knits, braids, meshes, and non-wovens, perforated films, sponges and foams, and beads, such as solid or porous beads, microparticles, nanoparticles, and the like (e.g., Cultispher-S gelatin beadsâSigma). The cells can be prepared for delivery in a variety of different forms. For example, the cells can be suspended in a solution or gel. Cells can be mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent in which the cells remain viable. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and diluents include saline, aqueous buffer solutions, solvents and/or dispersion media. The use of such carriers and diluents is well known in the art. The solution is preferably sterile and fluid, and will often be isotonic. Preferably, the solution is stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi through the use of, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. One of skill in the art will appreciate that the delivery vehicle used in the delivery of the cell populations and admixtures thereof can include combinations of the above-mentioned characteristics.</p>
      <p id="p-00254-en" num="0254">Modes of administration of the formulations containing isolated renal cell population(s), for example, the B2 cell population alone or admixed with B4â² and/or B3, include, but are not limited to, systemic, intra-renal (e.g., parenchymal), intravenous or intra-arterial injection and injection directly into the tissue at the intended site of activity. Additional modes of administration to be used include single or multiple injection(s) via direct laparotomy, via direct laparoscopy, transabdominal, or percutaneous. Still yet additional modes of administration to be used include, for example, retrograde and ureteropelvic infusion. Surgical means of administration include one-step procedures such as, but not limited to, partial nephrectomy and construct implantation, partial nephrectomy, partial pyelectomy, vascularization with omentumÂ±peritoneum, multifocal biopsy needle tracks, cone or pyramidal, to cylinder, and renal pole-like replacement, as well as two-step procedures including, for example, organoid-internal bioreactor for replanting. In one embodiment, the formulations containing admixtures of cells are delivered via the same route at the same time. In another embodiment, each of the cell compositions comprising the controlled admixture are delivered separately to specific locations or via specific methodologies, either simultaneously or in a temporally-controlled manner, by one or more of the methods described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00255-en" num="0255">The appropriate cell implantation dosage in humans can be determined from existing information relating to either the activity of the cells, for example EPO production, or extrapolated from dosing studies conducted in preclinical studies. From in vitro culture and in vivo animal experiments, the amount of cells can be quantified and used in calculating an appropriate dosage of implanted material. Additionally, the patient can be monitored to determine if additional implantation can be made or implanted material reduced accordingly.</p>
      <p id="p-00256-en" num="0256">One or more other components can be added to the cell populations and admixtures thereof, including selected extracellular matrix components, such as one or more types of collagen or hyaluronic acid known in the art, and/or growth factors, platelet-rich plasma and drugs.</p>
      <p id="p-00257-en" num="0257">Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the various formulations and methods of administration suitable for the secreted products described herein.</p>

      <p id="p-00266-en" num="0265">This example illustrates the isolation of an unfractionated (UNFX) heterogeneous renal cell population from human. Initial tissue dissociation was performed to generate heterogeneous cell suspensions from human kidney tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00267-en" num="0266">Renal tissue via kidney biopsy provided the source material for a heterogeneous renal cell population. Renal tissue comprising one or more of cortical, corticomedullary junction or medullary tissue may be used. It is preferred that the corticomedullary junction tissue is used. Multiple biopsy cores (minimum 2), avoiding scar tissue, were required from a CKD kidney. Renal tissue was obtained by the clinical investigator from the patient at the clinical site approximately 4 weeks in advance of planned implantation of the final NKA. The tissue was transported in the Tissue Transport Medium of Example 1.</p>
      <p id="p-00268-en" num="0267">The tissue was then washed with Tissue Wash Solution of Example 1 in order to reduce incoming bioburden before processing the tissue for cell extractions.</p>
      <p id="p-00269-en" num="0268">Renal tissue was minced, weighed, and dissociated in the Digestion Solution of Example 1. The resulting cell suspension was neutralized in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)+10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad Calif.), washed, and resuspended in serum-free, supplement-free, Keratinocyte Media (KSFM) (Invitrogen). Cell suspensions were then subjected to a 15% (w/v) iodixanol (OptiPrepâ¢, Sigma) gradient to remove red blood cells and debris prior to initiation of culture onto tissue culture treated polystyrene flasks or dishes at a density of 25,000 cells per cm<sup>2 </sup>in Renal Cell Growth Medium of Example 1. For example, cells may be plated onto T500 Nunc flask at 25Ã10<sup>6 </sup>cells/flask in 150 ml of 50:50 media.</p>

      <p id="p-00270-en" num="0269">Renal cell expansion is dependent on the amount of tissue received and on the success of isolating renal cells from the incoming tissue. Isolated cells can be cryopreserved, if required (see infra). Renal cell growth kinetics may vary from sample to sample due to the inherent variability of cells isolated from individual patients.</p>
      <p id="p-00271-en" num="0270">A defined cell expansion process was developed that accommodates the range of cell recoveries resulting from the variability of incoming tissue Table 3.1. Expansion of renal cells involves serial passages in closed culture vessels (e.g., T-flasks, Cell Factories, HyperStacksÂ®) in Renal Cell Growth Medium Table 1.1 using defined cell culture procedures.</p>
      <p id="p-00272-en" num="0271">A BPE-free medium was developed for human clinical trials to eliminate the inherent risks associated with the use of BPE.

Cells were assessed to verify renal cell morphology by visual observation of cultures under the microscope. Cultures characteristically demonstrated a tight pavement or cobblestone appearance, due to the cells clustering together. These morphological characteristics vary during expansion and may not be present at every passage. Cell culture confluence was estimated using an Image Library of cells at various levels of confluence in the culture vessels employed throughout cell expansions.</p>

Typically renal cells undergo 2 or 3 passages; however, duration of culture and cell yield can vary depending on the cell growth rate. This is exemplified in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> where the culture duration and cell yields (calculation) from 6 patients are shown.</p>

Cryopreserved cells also provide a backup source of cells in the event that another NKA is needed (e.g., delay due to patient sickness, unforeseen process events, etc.). Conditions were established that have been used to cryopreserve cells and recover viable, functional cells upon thawing.</p>

      <p id="p-00289-en" num="0286">The objective of the present study was to determine the functional characterization of human NKA cells through high content analysis (HCA). High-content imaging (HCl) provides simultaneous imaging of multiple sub-cellular events using two or more fluorescent probes (multiplexing) across a number of samples. High-content Analysis (HCA) provides simultaneous quantitative measurement of multiple cellular parameters captured in High-Content Images. In brief, unfractionated (UNFX) cultures were generated (Aboushwareb et al., <i>World J Urol </i>26, 295, 2008) and maintained independently from core biopsies taken from five human kidneys with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and three non-CKD human kidneys using standard biopsy procedures. After (2) passages of UNFX ex vivo, cells were harvested and subjected to density gradient methods (as described in Example 2 of Basu et al., WO 2012/064369) to generate subfractions, including subfractions B2, B3, and/or B4.</p>

Cells were exposed to 25 Î¼g/mL rhodamine-conjugated bovine albumin (Invitrogen) for 30 min, washed with ice cold PBS to stop endocytosis and fixed immediately with 2% paraformaldehyde containing 25 Î¼g/mL Hoechst nuclear dye. For inhibition experiments, 1 Î¼M receptor-associated protein (RAP) (Ray Biotech, Inc., Norcross Ga.) was added 10 minutes prior to albumin addition. Microscopic imaging and analysis was performed with a BD Pathwayâ¢ 855 High-Content BioImager (Becton Dickinson) (see Kelley et al. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol. 2010 November; 299(5):F1026-39.

      <p id="p-00294-en" num="0291">In conclusion, HCA yields cellular level data and can reveal populations dynamics that are undetectable by other assays, i.e., gene or protein expression. A quantifiable ex-vivo HCA assay for measuring albumin transport (HCA-AT) function can be utilized to characterize human renal tubular cells as components of human NKA prototypes. HCA-AT enabled comparative evaluation of cellular function, showing that albumin transport-competent cells were retained in NKA cultures derived from human CKD kidneys. It was also shown that specific subfractions of NKA cultures, B2 and B4, were distinct in phenotype and function, with B2 representing a tubular cell-enriched fraction with enhanced albumin transport activity. The B2 cell subpopulation from human CKD are phenotypically and functionally analogous to rodent B2 cells that demonstrated efficacy in viva (as shown above).</p>

      <p id="p-00295-en" num="0292">To determine the effect of oxygen conditions on distribution and composition of prototypes B2 and B4, neokidney cell preparations from different species were exposed to different oxygen conditions prior to the gradient step. A rodent neo-kidney augmentation (NKA) cell preparation (RK069) was established using standard procedures for rat cell isolation and culture initiation, as described in Kelley et al., 2010, supra. All flasks were cultured for 2-3 days in 21% (atmospheric) oxygen conditions. Media was changed and half of the flasks were then relocated to an oxygen-controlled incubator set to 2% oxygen, while the remaining flasks were kept at the 21% oxygen conditions, for an additional 24 hours. Cells were then harvested from each set of conditions using standard enzymatic harvesting procedures described supra. Step gradients were prepared according to standard procedures and the ânormoxicâ (21% oxygen) and âhypoxicâ (2% oxygen) cultures were harvested separately and applied side-by-side to identical step gradients. While 4 bands and a pellet were generated in both conditions, the distribution of the cells throughout the gradient was different in 21% and 2% oxygen-cultured batches (Table 7.1). Specifically, the yield of B2 was increased with hypoxia, with a concomitant decrease in 83. Furthermore, the expression of B4-specific genes (such as erythropoietin) was enhanced in the resulting gradient generated from the hypoxic-cultured cells (FIG. 73 of Presnell et al. WO/2010/056328).</p>
      <p id="p-00296-en" num="0293">A canine NKA cell preparation (DK008) was established using standard procedures for dog cell isolation and culture (analogous to rodent isolation and culture procedures), as described in Basu et al., WO 2012/064369. All flasks were cultured for 4 days in 21% (atmospheric) oxygen conditions, then a subset of flasks were transferred to hypoxia (2%) for 24 hours while a subset of the flasks were maintained at 21%. Subsequently, each set of flasks was harvested and subjected to identical step gradients. Similar to the rat results, the hypoxic-cultured dog cells distributed throughout the gradient differently than the atmospheric oxygen-cultured dog cells (Table 7.1). Again, the yield of B2 was increased with hypoxic exposure prior to gradient, along with a concomitant decrease in distribution into B3.</p>

      <p id="p-00300-en" num="0296">To determine the unbiased genotypic composition of specific subpopulations of renal cells isolated and expanded from kidney tissue, quantitative real time PCR (qRTPCR) analysis (Brunskill et al., supra 2008) was employed to identify differential cell-type-specific and pathway-specific gene expression patterns among the cell subfractions. Human preparation HK023, derived from a case of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in which a large portion of glomeruli had been destroyed, was evaluated for presence of glomerular cells in the B4 fraction at the time of harvest. In brief, unfractionated (UNFX) cultures were generated (Aboushwareb et al., <i>World J Urol </i>26, 295, 2008) and maintained independently from each of (4) core biopsies taken from the kidney using standard biopsy procedures. After (2) passages of UNFX ex vivo, cells were harvested and subjected to density gradient methods according to Example 6 of Basu et al., WO2012/064369 to generate subfractions, including subfraction B4, which is known to be enriched for endocrine, vascular, and glomerular cells based on work conducted in rodent, dog, and other human specimens.</p>
      <p id="p-00301-en" num="0297">The B4 fractions were collected separately from each independent UNFX sample of HK023, appearing as distinct bands of cells with buoyant density between 1.063-1.091 g/mL. RNA was isolated from each sample and examined for expression of Podocin (glomerular cell marker) and PECAM (endothelial cell marker) by quantitative real-time PCR. As expected from a biopsy-generated sample from a case of severe FSGS, the presence of podocin(+) glomerular cells in 84 fractions was inconsistent, with podocin undetectable in 2/4 of the samples. In contrast, PECAM+ vascular cells were consistently present in the B4 fractions of 4/4 of the biopsy-initiated cultures. Thus, the B4 fraction can be isolated at the 1.063-1.091 g/mL density range, even from human kidneys with severe disease states.</p>

Cell count and viability is then determined using trypan blue exclusion method. For kidney cell enrichment/depletion of, for example, glomerular cells or endothelial cells from a heterogeneous population, between 10 and 50Ã10<sup>6 </sup>live cells with a viability of at least 70% are obtained. The heterogeneous population of kidney cells is then stained with primary antibody specific for target cell type at a starting concentration of 1 Î¼g/0.1 ml of staining buffer/1Ã10<sup>6 </sup>cells (titer if necessary). Target antibody can be conjugated such as CD31 PE (specific for kidney endothelial cells) or un-conjugated such as Nephrin (specific for kidney glomerular cells).</p>
      <p id="p-00309-en" num="0304">Cells are then stained for 30 minutes on ice or at 4Â° C. protected from light. After 30 minutes of incubation, cells are washed by centrifugation at 300Ãg for 5 min.

If cells are labeled with a fluorochrome conjugated primary antibody, cells are resuspended in 2 mls of PBS per 10<sup>7 </sup>cells and proceed to FACS aria or equivalent cell sorter. If cells are not labeled with a fluorochrome conjugated antibody, then cells are labeled with an isotype specific fluorochrome conjugated secondary antibody at a starting concentration of 1 Î¼g/0.1 ml/10<sup>6 </sup>cells.</p>

The sample tube is loaded into the FACs Aria and PMT voltages are adjusted after acquisition begins. The gates are drawn to select kidney specific cells types using fluorescent intensity using a specific wavelength. Another gate is drawn to select the negative population. Once the desired gates have been drawn to encapsulate the positive target population and the negative population, the cells are sorted using manufacturer's instructions.</p>
      <p id="p-00312-en" num="0307">The positive target population is collected in one 15 ml conical tube and the negative population in another 15 ml conical tube filled with 1 ml of kidney cell medium.

      <heading id="h-00041-en" level="1">Phenotypic Characterization of the Enriched Heterogeneous Renal Cell Population</heading>
      <p id="p-00326-en" num="0321">The following example details the use of flow cytometry to characterize the selected heterogeneous human renal cells of Example 5. The heterogeneous renal cell population was composed primarily of renal epithelial cells that are well known for their regenerative potential. Other parenchymal (vascular) and stromal (collecting duct) cells may be sparsely present in the autologous cell population.</p>
      <p id="p-00327-en" num="0322">Cell phenotype is monitored by expression analysis of renal cell markers using flow cytometry. Phenotypic analysis of cells is based on the use of antigenic markers specific for the cell type being analyzed. Flow cytometric analysis provides a quantitative measure of cells in the sample population which express the antigenic marker being analyzed.</p>
      <p id="p-00328-en" num="0323">A variety of markers have been reported in the literature as being useful for phenotypic characterization of renal cells: (i) cytokeratins; (ii) transport membrane proteins (aquaporins and cubilin); (iii) cell binding molecules (adherins, cluster of differentiation, and lectins); and (iv) metabolic enzymes (glutathione). Since the majority of cells found in cultures derived from whole kidney digests are epithelial and endothelial cells, the markers examined focus on the expression of proteins specific for these two groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00329-en" num="0324">Cytokeratins are a family of intermediate filament proteins expressed by many types of epithelial cells to varying degrees. The subset of cytokeratins expressed by an epithelial cell depends upon the type of epithelium. For example, cytokeratins 7, 8, 18 and 19 are all expressed by normal simple epithelia of the kidney and remaining urogenital tract as well as the digestive and respiratory tracts. These cytokeratins in combination are responsible for the structural integrity of epithelial cells. This combination represents both the acidic (type I) and basic (type II) keratin families and is found abundantly expressed in renal cells (Oosterwijk et al., J Histochem Cytochem, 38(3):385-392, 1990). Preferred cytokeratins for use herein are CK8, CK18, CK19 and combinations thereof</p>
      <p id="p-00330-en" num="0325">Aquaporins are transport membrane proteins which allow the passage of water into and out of the cell, while preventing the passage of ions and other solutes. There are thirteen aquaporins described in the literature, with six of these being found in the kidney (Nielsen et al., J Histochem Cytochem, 38(3):385-392, 2002). Aquaporin2, by exerting tight control in regulating water flow, is responsible for the plasma membranes of renal collecting duct epithelial cells having a high permeability to water, thus permitting water to flow in the direction of an osmotic gradient (Bedford et al., J Am Soc Nephrol, 14(10):2581-2587, 2003; Takata et al., Histochem Cell Biol, 130(2):197-209, 2008; Tamma et al., Endocrinology, 148(3):1118-1130, 2007). Aquaporin1 is characteristic of the proximal tubules (Baer et al., Cells Tissues Organs: 184(1), 16-22, 2006; Nielsen et al., 2002, supra).</p>
      <p id="p-00331-en" num="0326">Cubilin is a transport membrane receptor protein. When it co-localizes with the protein megalin, together they promote the internalization of cubilin-bound ligands such as albumin. Cubilin is located within the epithelium of the intestine and the kidney (Christensen, Am J Physiol Renal Physiol, 280(4):F562-573, 2001).</p>
      <p id="p-00332-en" num="0327">CXCR4 is a transport membrane protein which serves as a chemokine receptor for SDF1. Upon ligand binding, intracellular calcium levels increase and MAPK1/MAPK3 activation is increased. CXCR4 is constitutively expressed in the kidney and plays an important role in kidney development and tubulogenesis (Ueland et al., Dev Dyn, 238(5):1083-1091, 2009).</p>
      <p id="p-00333-en" num="0328">Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell adhesion proteins. They are classified into four groups, with the E-cadherins being found in epithelial tissue, and are involved in regulating mobility and proliferation. E-cadherin is a transmembrane glycoprotein which has been found to be localized in the adherins junctions of epithelial cells which make up the distal tubules in the kidney (Prozialeck et al., BMC Physiol, 4:10, 2004; Shen et al., Mod Pathol, 18(7):933-940, 2005).</p>
      <p id="p-00334-en" num="0329">DBA (<i>Dolichos biflorus agglutinin</i>) is an Î±-N-acetylgalactosamine-binding lectin (cell binding protein) carried on the surface of renal collecting duct structures, and is regarded and used as a general marker of developing renal collecting ducts and distal tubules (Michael et al., J Anat 210(1):89-97, 2007; Lazzeri et al., J Am Soc Nephrol 18 (12):3128-3138, 2007).</p>
      <p id="p-00335-en" num="0330">Cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31; also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule, PECAM-1) is a cell adhesion protein which is expressed by select populations of immune cells as well as endothelial cells. In endothelial cells, this protein is concentrated at the cell borders (DeLisser, 1997). Cluster of differentiation 146 (CD146) is involved in cell adhesion and cohesion of endothelial cells at intercellular junctions associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Strongly expressed by blood vessel endothelium and smooth muscle, CD146 is currently used as a marker for endothelial cell lineage (Malyszko et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 89(9):4620-4627, 2004), and is the canine equivalent of CD31.</p>
      <p id="p-00336-en" num="0331">Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is a metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of the gamma-glutamyl moiety of glutathione to an acceptor that may be an amino acid, a peptide, or water, to form glutamate. This enzyme also plays a role in the synthesis and degradation of glutathione and the transfer of amino acids across the cell membrane. GGT is present in the cell membranes of many tissues, including the proximal tubule cells of kidneys (Horiuchi et al., Eur J Biochem, 87(3):429-437, 1978; Pretlow et al., J Histochem Cytochem, 35(4):483-487, 1987; Welbourne et al., Am J Physiol, 277(4 Pt 2):F501-505, 1999). Table 12.1 provides a list of the specific types of renal cells expressing these markers as detected by flow cytometry.</p>

      <p id="p-00342-en" num="0334">Cell suspensions were generated from initial tissue dissociation or trypsinization of adherent cultures and analyzed by flow cytometry to identify cellular components. Antibodies employed are listed in Tables 12.2 and 12.3 (above). Isotype-specific primary antibody negative controls were used in all experiments. Labeled cells were analyzed with a FACSAria flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and FlowJo software (Treestar, Inc.). Appropriate isotype-matched controls were used to gate negative populations. After an overnight incubation at 4Â° C., the cells were pelleted, washed twice with Triton Buffer (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS), resuspended in 1 mL of DBPS containing secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG2A conjugated to the fluorochrome Alexa A647 (Invitrogen), and incubated for an additional 30 minutes. Cells were then washed and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS for analysis as per manufacturer instructions using FACSAria and FlowJo software. As a negative control, cells were incubated in parallel with isotype-matched monoclonal antibodies conjugated to the same fluorochrome.</p>

      <p id="p-00344-en" num="0336">CK8/18/19 are the most consistently expressed renal cell proteins detected across species. GGT1 and Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) are expressed consistently but at varying levels. DBA, Aquaporin2 (AQP2), E-cadherin (CAD), CK7, and CXCR4 are also observed at modest levels though with more variability, and CD31/146 and Cubilin were lowest in expression. Table 12.4 provides the selected markers, range and mean percentage values of phenotypic in SRC and the rationale for their selection.</p>

      <p id="p-00347-en" num="0338">The gene expression profile of SRC isolated from human renal cell cultures by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), including those of aquaporin2, E-cadherin, cubulin, VEGF and CD31 that were also tested for protein production. Genotypic markers in Table 12.5 are representative of cell populations that might be expected to be found in the renal cell cultures. NCAD, Cubilin and CYP2R1 are markers of tubular epithelial cells, AQP2 and ECAD are markers of collecting duct and distal tubules. Podocin and Nephrin are markers of podocytes. VEGF and CD31 are endothelial markers. VEGF and EPO are oxygen responsive genes with related mRNA present in a variety of different tissue and cell types.</p>
      <p id="p-00348-en" num="0339">Gene probes used were obtained from TaqMan. Passage 2 human renal cells were harvested at 70-90% confluence. RNA was purified from the cells using Qiagen's RNeasy Plus Mini Kit following the protocol for Purification of Total RNA from Animal Cells. cDNA was generated from a volume of RNA equal to 1.4 Î¼g using Invitrogen's SuperScriptÂ® VILOâ¢ cDNA Synthesis Kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Averaged qPCR data for SRC populations (n=3) is shown in Table 12.5.</p>
      <p id="p-00349-en" num="0340">The results suggest that a population of tubular epithelial cells is present as evidenced by relatively higher level of expression of NCAD, Cubilin and CYP2R1. Distal Collecting Duct Tubule and Distal Tubule markers AQP2 and ECAD are relatively low and CD31, an endothelial marker is even lower (Table 12.5).</p>

      <p id="p-00355-en" num="0345">Viable functioning cells can be monitored in NKA by their ability to metabolize PrestoBlue. PrestoBlue Cell Viability Reagent is a modified resazurin-based assay reagent that is a cell permeable, non-fluorescent blue dye. Upon entry into cells which are sufficiently viable to proliferate, the dye is reduced, via natural cell processes involving dehydrogenase enzymes, to a bright red fluorophore that can be measured by fluorescence or absorbance.</p>
      <p id="p-00356-en" num="0346">Biomolecules VEGF and KIM-1 represent a selection of molecules from those proposed as sensitive and specific analytical nonclinical biomarkers of kidney injury and function (Sistare, 2010; Warnock, 2010). In vivo, both of these markers are indicative of tubular function, injury and/or repair and in vitro are recognized features of tubular epithelial cell cultures. KIM-1 is an extracellular protein anchored in the membrane of renal proximal tubule cells that serves to recognize and phagocytose apoptotic cells which are shed during injury and cell turnover. VEGF, constitutively expressed by kidney cells, is a pivotal angiogenic and pro-survival factor that promotes cell division, migration, endothelial cell survival and vascular sprouting. SRC have been characterized as constitutively expressing VEGF mRNA (Table 12.5) and actively produce the protein (Table 12.6). These proteins may be detected in culture medium exposed to renal cells and SRC. Table 12.6 presents VEGF and KIM-1 quantities present in conditioned medium from renal cells and SRC cultures. Renal cells were cultured to near confluence. Conditioned medium from overnight exposure to the renal cell cultures and SRC was tested for VEGF and KIM-1.</p>

      <p id="p-00358-en" num="0347">Cell function of SRC, pre-formulation, was also evaluated by measuring the activity of two specific enzymes; GGT (Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase) and LAP (leucine aminopeptidase) (Chung, 1982, J Cell Biol 95(1):118-126), found in kidney proximal tubules. Methods to measure the activity of these enzymes in cells utilize an enzyme-specific substrate in solution that, when added to cells expressing active enzyme, are cleaved, releasing a chromogenic product (Nachlas, 1960 J Biophys Biochem Cytol 7:261-264; Tate, 1974 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 71(9):3329-3333). The absorbance of the cell-exposed solution is measured and is relative to the amount of cleavage product resulting from active enzyme. The substrate utilized for GGT is L-glutamic acid Î³-p-nitroanalide hydrochloride and for LAP is L-leucine p-nitroanalide. <figref>FIG. 6</figref> shows LAP and GGT activity in six SRC samples produced from human donors (BP1-BP4).</p>
      <p id="p-00359-en" num="0348">Summary of SRC Characterization</p>
      <p id="p-00360-en" num="0349">Cell morphology was monitored during cell expansion by comparison of culture observations with images in an Image Library. Cell growth kinetics were monitored at each cell passage. Cell growth is expected to be variable from patient to patient. SRC counts and viability were monitored by Trypan Blue dye exclusion and/or metabolism of PrestoBlue. SRC are characterized by phenotypic expression of CK18, GGT1. In addition AQP2 expression may be monitored. Metabolism of PrestoBlue and production of VEGF and KIM-1 are used as markers for the presence of viable and functional SRC. SRC function can be further elucidated with gene expression profiling and measurement of enzymatic activity with LAP and GGT.</p>

      <p id="p-00366-en" num="0355">Rheological properties of the Biomaterial can be measured first at 4Â° C., then at 25Â° C. through the use of a Couette Cell style rheometer. The sample is equilibrated for at least 30 minutes at each temperature. An acceptable storage modulus (Gâ²&gt;10) at the lower temperature reflects the ability of the solution to form and maintain a gel at NKA shipping and transport temperature of 2-8Â° C. An acceptable loss modulus (Gâ³&lt;10) at the higher temperature reflects the ability of the gel to liquefy at room temperature as required for delivery and implantation of NKA.</p>
      <p id="p-00367-en" num="0356">Viscosity of the Biomaterial is measured using a cone and plate viscometer at 37Â° C. and a shear rate of 200-300 s-1. Solutions with viscosities in range of 1.05-1.35 cP can be efficiently delivered through 18-27 gauge needles.</p>

      <p id="p-00372-en" num="0361">Formulated NKA was contained in a 50 mL sterile centrifuge tube. A sterile cannula was attached to a 10 mL transfer syringe. NKA was manually drawn into the transfer syringe from the 50 mL tube via the cannula. The cannula was removed and the transfer syringe was connected to the luer-lock fitting at the end of the NKA package tubing. NKA was transferred to the syringe in the NKA package by depressing the plunger on the transfer syringe. A minimum of 8.5 mL of product was transferred to the syringe in the NKA package. Air entrapped in the syringe was removed by inverting the syringe and slowly depressing the plunger. After filling was complete, the tubing on the NKA package was sealed with an RF Sealer. Remaining product in the transfer syringe was returned to the 50 mL tube. Quality control (release testing) samples were taken from the 50 mL tube. The NKA package was rotated for a minimum of 2 hours to keep the cells in suspension while cooling to 2-8Â° C. to form the final gelled NKA (<figref>FIG. 2D</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00373-en" num="0362">Rapid cooling was required for gelation to take place so that cells do not settle in the Gelatin Solution. The temperature of the Gelatin Solution in a syringe was monitored as it was placed into refrigerated conditions. Rapid temperature drop was observed. After 1 hour, the temperature had dropped to within 0.3Â° C. of the final temperature 4.4Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00374-en" num="0363">Cooling of the Gelatin Solution starts the gelation process but a finite amount to time was required for the formed gel to stabilize such that the SRC will remain suspended in the gel on storage. Syringes containing formulated NKA were rotated either overnight or for 1.25 hours and then held upright overnight. Subsequently, the contents were removed and cell concentration was measured in four different segments of the product. Analysis indicates that there was no difference among the four segments, thus no measurable cell settling occurs once NKA has rotated at cold temperature for a minimum of 1.25 hours (data not shown).</p>

The proposed clinical trial utilized the same delivery system (cannula and syringe) used in the animal studies adapted to human size and anatomy. A laparoscopic surgical procedure was used.</p>
      <p id="p-00380-en" num="0369">The main component of NKA delivery system was the cannula. A cannula that was compatible with NKA was used.</p>
      <p id="p-00381-en" num="0370">NKA Implantation</p>
      <p id="p-00382-en" num="0371">In preparation for implantation, NKA was allowed to warm to room temperature just before injection into the kidney to liquefy the product.</p>
      <p id="p-00383-en" num="0372">NKA was targeted for injection into the kidney cortex via a needle or cannula and syringe compatible with cell delivery. The use of a piercing needle (cannula) to penetrate the kidney capsule allowed introduction of the delivery needle/cannula into the kidney cortex. The syringe containing NKA was attached to the delivery needle and NKA was injected into multiple sites into the kidney cortex. The schematic in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the concept of injecting NKA into a kidney using a needle compatible with cell delivery and distribution into a solid organ.</p>
      <p id="p-00384-en" num="0373">NKA was delivered directly into the kidney cortex. NKA delivery in patients used a standardized laparoscopic procedure.</p>
