      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Certain embodiments are described below with reference to singular and plural terms in order to provide a user friendly description of the technology disclosed herein. These terms are used for convenience purposes only and are not intended to limit the articles, composites and other subject matter as including or excluding certain features unless otherwise noted as being present in a particular embodiment described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In certain examples described herein, articles can be produced using one or more high melt flow index resins. The term âhigh melt flow resinâ is a relative term and generally refers to the ease of flow of the melt of a thermoplastic polymer. In some embodiments, the term âhighâ refers to resins whose melt flow indices, as measured by ASTM D1238, condition L, are about 100 g/10 min. or more. In other embodiments, the term âhighâ refers to resins whose melt flow indices, as measured by ASTM D1238, condition L, are 325 g/10 min or higher or are greater than 325 g/10 min., e.g., 350 g/10 min., 400 g/10 min., 450 g/10 min., 500 g/10 min., 550 g/10 min, 600 g/10 min. or more. In some embodiments, a resin whose melt flow index is greater than 325 g/10 min. but less than 750 g/10 min. is referred to herein as a âfast melt flow resin.â In certain examples, a resin whose melt flow index is greater than or equal to 750 g/10 min but less than 1000 g/10 min is referred to as a âsuper melt flow resin.â In other embodiments, a resin whose melt flow index is greater than or equal to 1000 g/10 min but less than 1250 g/10 min. is referred to as a âhyper melt flow resin.â In yet additional embodiments, a resin whose melt flow index is greater than or equal to 1250 g/10 min is referred to as an âextreme melt flow resin.â The particular resin selected for use in the articles described herein may depend, for example, on the overall desired weight of the article, its desired physical properties, production costs, production time and desired end use of the article. In certain embodiments, articles described herein that include a high melt flow resin can weigh less while retaining desired physical properties. Where high melt flow resins are used in vehicular parts, increased gas mileage can be achieved due to reduction in overall weight while still retaining the desired structural and physical features of the vehicular parts.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In certain embodiments, where the test ASTM D1238 is referred to herein, the temperature used is 230Â° C. and the load is 2.16 kg as specified in âcondition Lâ of the ASTM D1238 test method. Unless otherwise clear from the context where a different condition is specified, reference to ASTM D1238 refers to condition L conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In certain examples, the exact processing conditions used to provide an article including a high melt flow index resin can vary. In some embodiments, the processing temperature can be lower, compared to the processing temperature used with resins other than high melt flow index resins. The use of lower temperatures saves energy and can reduce production time as the articles may be heated at lower temperatures or the overall heating time may be less. In some embodiments, high melt flow index resins may also include lower amounts of thermal stabilizers than present in resins other than high melt flow index resins. It may be desirable to reduce the processing temperature to avoid degradation of the high melt flow index resin. In some embodiments, one or more thermal stabilizers can be added to a high melt flow index resin to reduce the likelihood that it may degrade when exposed to high temperatures. While such thermal stabilizers may be added in an effective amount to deter degradation of the resin, the amount added desirably does not alter the basis weight of the final article to such an unwanted degree or alter the physical properties imparted to the article by the high melt flow index resin.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In certain embodiments, the high melt flow resin can be mixed with one or more additive or materials to impart a desired characteristic to the mixture. For example, the high melt flow resin can be mixed with particles, powders, whiskers, fillers, binders, fibers or other materials that can impart desired physical properties to an article that includes the high melt flow resin. In certain embodiments, flame retardant materials such as halogenated materials, phosphorated materials, nitrogenated materials or other suitable flame retardants can be added to the high melt flow resin. In further embodiments, smoke suppressants, oxygen scavengers, ultraviolet light inhibitors, dyes, colorants, pigments or other materials can be added to the high melt flow resin, either before curing or post-curing.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In some embodiments, the additive may include reinforcing materials that can impart increased strength to the article. For example, a composite article that is produced using a high melt flow resin can include one or more suitable types of reinforcing materials to impart a desired strength and/or mechanical properties to the composite. In some embodiments, the reinforcing materials can be one or more types of fibers. Illustrative types of fibers include, but are not limited to, glass fibers, carbon fibers, graphite fibers, synthetic organic fibers, particularly high modulus organic fibers such as, for example, para- and meta-aramid fibers, nylon fibers, polyester fibers, or any of the high melt flow index resins described herein that are suitable for use as fibers, natural fibers such as hemp, sisal, jute, flax, coir, kenaf and cellulosic fibers, mineral fibers such as basalt, mineral wool (e.g., rock or slag wool), wollastonite, alumina silica, and the like, or mixtures thereof, metal fibers, metalized natural and/or synthetic fibers, ceramic fibers, yarn fibers, or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the fibers can be chemically treated prior to use to provide desired functional groups or to impart other physical properties to the fibers. The fiber content in the polymer core may be from about 20% to about 90%, more particularly from about 30% to about 70%, by weight of the polymer core. Typically, the fiber content of the composite varies between about 20% to about 90% by weight, more particularly between about 40% to about 80% by weight of the composite. The particular size and/or orientation of the fibers used may depend, at least in part, on the polymer material used and/or the desired properties of the resulting composite. Suitable additional types of fibers, fiber sizes and amounts will be readily selected by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure. In one non-limiting illustration, fibers dispersed within a high melt flow index resin, forming the polymer core material of the composite, for example, generally have a diameter of greater than about 5 microns, more particularly from about 5 microns to about 22 microns, and a length of from about 5 mm to about 200 mm; more particularly, the fiber diameter may be from about microns to about 22 microns and the fiber length may be from about 5 mm to about 75 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In some embodiments, the presence of a high melt flow index resin optionally in combination with one or more reinforcing materials can permit use of articles having a lower basis weight while retaining the properties of an article with a higher basis weight. For example, an article can be produced using a resin comprising a melt flow index resin of greater than 325 grams/10 minute that has a basis weight of 450 grams per square meter (gsm) or less. In some embodiments such an article may have the physical properties similar to an article that has a basis weight of 500 gsm. For example, by using a high melt flow index resin, the basis weight of the article can be reduced by at least 10%, more particularly at least 15%, for example, at least 20% or at least 25%, while retaining substantially similar physical properties as an article having a higher basis weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In certain embodiments, the high melt flow index resin can be used in a core layer comprising the high melt flow index and optionally one or more polymeric materials. In some embodiments, the high melt flow index resin may be or may comprise a thermoplastic material such as, for example, the illustrative thermoplastic materials described herein. If desired, the core can comprise reinforcing materials such as, for example, fibers, whiskers, powders, particles, cross-linkable materials, or other materials that can increase the overall strength or impart a desired mechanical property to the core material. Where reinforcing materials are present, they can be present in a continuous or discontinuous form, homogenously throughout the core or localized or otherwise present in larger amounts in some areas compared to other areas. In embodiments where the reinforcing materials are fibers, the fibers can be arranged parallel to each other, orthogonal to each other or present in no particular angular orientation depending on the desired properties of the core material.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In certain embodiments, the high melt flow index resins can be used to provide a composite article. Such composites can provide a number of attributes, e.g., they can be molded and formed into a variety of suitable structural and non-structural articles, including, but not limited to, an automotive structural component such as, for example, a bumper, an interior headliner, an underbody shield, a fender liner, a fender flare, a skid plate, a cross-member, a dashboard, and interior and exterior trim parts. In other examples, the composites can be used as, or can be part of, a building panel, an acoustic panel, a vehicle panel, a lightweight structural member such as those present in a recreational vehicle, a wind turbine blade, a wind turbine housing, a photovoltaic cell panel backing, or other applications where it may be desirable to use or include lightweight materials that can provide enhanced formability.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In certain embodiments, traditional glass fiber composites used in exterior structural applications can be generally compression flow molded and can be substantially void free in their final part shape. By comparison, low density glass fiber composites used in automotive interior applications can be generally semi-structural in nature and are porous and lightweight with densities ranging from 0.1 to 1.8 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and containing 5% to 95% voids distributed uniformly through the thickness of the finished part. Certain automotive specifications desire light weight, good flexural, impact, and other mechanical properties, as well as good thermoformability characteristics and/or improved mechanical properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In certain examples described herein, a composite article comprises a core comprising one or more high melt flow index resins. In some embodiments, the high melt flow index resin may comprise a thermoplastic material such as, for example, the illustrative thermoplastic materials described herein. If desired, the core of the composite can include reinforcing materials such as, for example, fibers, whiskers, powders, particles, cross-linkable materials, or other materials that can increase the overall strength or impart a desired mechanical property to the core material. Where reinforcing materials are present, they can be present in a continuous or discontinuous form, homogenously throughout the core or localized or otherwise present in larger amounts in some areas compared to other areas. In embodiments where the reinforcing materials are fibers, the fibers can be arranged parallel to each other, orthogonal to each other or present in no particular angular orientation depending on the desired properties of the core material.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In certain embodiments, an outer surface layer or skin can be disposed or otherwise present on one or both sides of the core material or select areas or portions thereof. The term âskinâ is used broadly and intended to include layers, fabrics, films and other materials that can be formed on the core material or can be pre-formed and subsequently disposed on the core material or select areas or portions thereof. In certain examples, the skin used is effective to permit processing of the article into a desired final shape or part.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In certain examples, the composite can provide improved mechanical properties including improved flexural modulus at a lower basis weight, higher peak load and slope, higher flexural slope or other suitable mechanical properties which are improved in the composite. While not required, more than a single mechanical property can be improved by using one or more high melt flow index resins in the composites described herein, e.g., an increase in peak load flexural modulus, and/or mechanical characteristics of the composite noted herein may be improved individually or in any combination with each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In certain embodiments, the composite can be porous, non-porous or includes areas which are porous while comprising other areas which are non-porous. The exact porosity present in the composite can vary depending on the intended use of the composite. In certain embodiments, the polymer core can comprise a porosity greater than 0% by volume of the polymer core, more particularly between greater than 0% to about 95% by volume of the polymer core, and still more particularly between about 30% to about 70% by volume of the polymer core. While not required, it is also possible that the overall composite, which includes the polymer core, is non-porous or has a porosity within the aforementioned ranges, e.g., the porosity of the composite may generally be greater than 0% to about 95% of the total volume of the composite, more particularly between greater than 0% to about 95% by the total volume of the composite, and still more particularly between about 30% to about 70% by the total volume of the composite. In yet other examples, the core or the overall composite may comprise a porosity of 0-30%, 10-40%, 20-50%, 30-60%, 40-70%, 50-80%, 60-90%, 0-40%, 0-50%, 0-60%, 0-70%, 0-80%, 0-90%, 10-50%, 10-60%, 10-70%, 10-80%, 10-90%, 10-95%, 20-60%, 20-70%, 20-80%, 20-90%, 20-95%, 30-70%, 30-80%, 30-90%, 30-95%, 40-80%, 40-90%, 40-95%, 50-90%, 50-95%, 60-95% 70-80%, 70-90%, 70-95%, 80-90%, 80-95% or any illustrative value within these exemplary ranges. If desired the porosity of the core or the overall composite may be greater than 95%, e.g., may be about 96% or 97%.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">In certain examples, the composite typically includes a high melt flow index resin that is a polymer material that can function as an adhesive, binder, resin or is otherwise effective to impart desired properties to the composite. In some embodiments, the high melt flow index resin can be, or can include, a polymer resin or a polymer rosin. Illustrative types of polymer resins that can comprises a high melt flow index include, but are not limited to, those based on a polyolefin resin, a thermoplastic polyolefin blend resin, a polyvinyl polymer resin, a butadiene polymer resin, an acrylic polymer resin, a polyamide resin, a polyester resin, a polycarbonate resin, a polyestercarbonate resin, a polystyrene resin, an acrylonitrylstyrene polymer resin, an acrylonitrile-butylacrylate-styrene polymer resin, a polyimide resin, a polyphenylene ether resin, a polyphenylene oxide resin, a polyphenylenesulphide resin, a polyether resin, a polyetherketone resin, a polyacetal resin, a polyurethane resin, a polybenzimidazole resin, and copolymers, mixtures and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the high melt flow index resin can include two polymer resins, three polymer resins, four polymer resins or more. In other examples, different portions of the composite can include different polymer material compositions. For example, a first area of the composite can include a first high melt flow index resin, and a second area of the composite can include a second high melt flow index resin different from the first high melt flow index resin. Other high melt flow index resins may also be used that can be sufficiently softened by heat or other radiation to permit fusing and/or molding without being chemically or thermally decomposed (to any substantial degree) during processing or formation of the composite material. Such other suitable high melt flow index resins will be readily selected by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In some embodiments, the high melt flow index resin can be pre-processed or chemically treated prior to use in the composites described herein. For example, thermostabilizers, softening agents, viscosity modifiers, thickening agents, chaotropic agents, diluents or other materials can be added to the high melt flow index resins prior to their use to provide a composite article. In certain examples, a dispersing agent can be added to the high melt flow index resin to assist in mixing of the high melt flow index resin with other components used to provide the article.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In certain embodiments, the composite described herein can comprise a glass mat thermoplastic composite (GMT). One such mat is prepared by HANWHA AZDEL, Inc. and sold under the trademark SUPERLITEÂ® mat. Preferably, the areal density of such a GMT is from about 400 grams per square meter of the GMT (g/m2) to about 4000 g/m2, although the areal density may be less than 400 g/m2 or greater than 4000 g/m2 depending on the specific application needs. In some embodiments, the upper density can be less than about 4000 g/m2. Where the core includes a high MFI resin and/or one or more skins with a high MFI resin, the basis weight of the GMT can be reduced to less than 400 gsm without sacrificing desired physical properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In certain examples, the glass mat thermoplastic composite can be generally prepared using chopped glass fibers, a high melt flow index resin and a thermoplastic polymer film or films and or woven or non-woven fabrics made with glass fibers or thermoplastic resin fibers such as, for example, polypropylene (PP), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), a blend of PC/PBT, or a blend of PC/PET. In some embodiments, a PP, a PBT, a PET, a PC/PET blend or a PC/PBT blend are can be used as the high melt flow index resin. To produce the glass mat, the high melt flow index resin, reinforcing materials and/or other additives can be added or metered into a dispersing foam contained in an open top mixing tank fitted with an impeller. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the presence of trapped pockets of air of the foam can assist in dispersing the glass fibers and high melt flow index resin. In some examples, the dispersed mixture of glass and high melt flow index resin can be pumped to a head-box located above a wire section of a paper machine via a distribution manifold. The foam, not the glass fiber or high melt flow index resin, can then be removed as the dispersed mixture is provided to a moving wire screen using a vacuum, continuously producing a uniform, fibrous wet web. The wet web can be passed through a dryer at a suitable temperature to reduce moisture content and to melt or soften the high melt flow index resin. When the hot web exits the dryer, a surface layer such as, for example, a thermoplastic film may be laminated onto the web by passing the web of glass fiber, thermoplastic resin and thermoplastic polymer film or films through the nip of a set of heated rollers. A non-woven and/or woven fabric layer may also be attached along with or in place of the thermoplastic film to one side or to both sides of the web to facilitate ease of handling the glass fiber-reinforced mat. The composite can then be passed through tension rolls and continuously cut (guillotined) into the desired size for later forming into an end product article.

      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Certain illustrative configurations of articles that include a high melt flow index resin are shown in the figures. Referring now to <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>, a composite <b>100</b> is shown that comprises a layer <b>110</b> comprising a high melt flow index resin. The layer <b>110</b> can include any one or more of those materials described herein, e.g., a GMT composite produced using glass fibers and a high melt flow index resin comprising polypropylene or polybutylene terephthalate or a combination thereof or other suitable high melt flow index resin. In some embodiments, the basis weight of the layer <b>110</b> may vary from about 150 gsm to about 3000 gsm, more particularly about 200 gsm to about 3000 gsm, e.g., about 500-1800 gsm. In certain examples, the layer <b>110</b> can have dimensions of about 1 meter wide by about 6 meters long, more particularly about 2 meters wide by about 5 meters long, e.g., about 2 meters wide cm by about 4 meters long cm. In some embodiments, the overall thickness of the composite can vary from about 0.5 mm to about 30 mm, more particularly about 3 mm to about 25 mm cm, e.g., about 0.5 mm to about 10 mm. The overall dimensions and size of the layer <b>110</b> can be shaped or trimmed to a desired size prior to stacking or palletizing the sheets of the layer <b>110</b> for shipping purposes.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">In some examples, the layer <b>110</b> may be joined or coupled to another layer similar to the layer <b>110</b> to provide a two-layer stack as shown in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>. For example, the article <b>150</b> can include a layer <b>120</b> disposed on the layer <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the layer <b>120</b> may include a resin with a melt flow index that is less than 100 g/10 minutes. In other embodiments, each of the layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> may include the same high melt flow index resin, whereas in additional examples, the layer <b>120</b> may include at least one high melt flow index resin that is different from a high melt flow index resin(s) used in the layer <b>110</b>. If desired, one or more adhesives or other materials can be placed between the layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> to couple them to each other. In some embodiments, no adhesive or other material is present between the layers, and heating of the layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> to soften them can be used to couple the two layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> to each other. If desired, the article <b>150</b> can be consolidated, passed through rollers, compressed, molded or otherwise subjected to one or more post-coupling steps to provide a desired thickness, shape, porosity, or other physical property. While the two layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> are shown in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref> as having substantially the same thickness, the thickness of the two layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> can vary. For example, it may be desirable to configure one of the layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> with increased thickness where that layer is designed to impart structural stiffness to the article. In some configurations, the fibers or other additives used in each of the layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> may be the same or may be different. For example, it may be desirable to use a first type of fiber in layer <b>110</b> and a second, different type of fiber in the layer <b>120</b> to impart desired overall properties to the final article. In some examples, the same type of fibers can be used in the layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, but the fiber loading weights can be varied if desired to provide a fiber gradient from surface to surface within the article <b>150</b>. In certain examples, one or more additional layers comprising a high melt flow index resin (or comprising a resin with a melt flow index less than 100 g/10 minutes) can be coupled to the article <b>150</b> to provide a three-layer stack, a four-layer stack or a multi-layer stack, if desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">In certain embodiments, a composite article comprising a core layer comprising a high melt flow index resin and a surface layer disposed thereon is described. In some embodiments, the core layer can be a single layer as shown in <figref>FIG. 1A</figref> or may be a two or more layer stack as shown and described in reference to <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>. Referring now to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a composite article <b>200</b> comprising a core layer <b>210</b> with a surface layer or skin <b>220</b> disposed thereon is shown. In some examples, the core layer <b>210</b> comprises one or more high melt flow index resins as described herein optionally in combination with one or more types of fiber reinforcing materials. While the surface layer <b>220</b> is shown as being disposed on an upper planar surface of the core layer <b>210</b>, the surface layer <b>220</b> can be disposed on a surface orthogonal to a longitudinal plane of the core layer <b>210</b>, e.g., on one or more sides of the core layer <b>210</b> or on both planar surfaces and side surfaces of the core layer <b>210</b>. In some configurations, the surface layer <b>220</b> can be generally continuous from one side of the core layer <b>210</b> to the other side of the core layer <b>210</b>. In certain instances, the surface layer <b>220</b> can be disposed in strips or patches on the core layer <b>210</b> such that certain portions of the core layer <b>210</b> are exposed to ambient. In other embodiments, the surface layer <b>220</b> may have a varying thickness across the planar surface of the core layer <b>210</b>. For example, certain regions of the surface layer <b>220</b> may be thicker than other regions of the surface layer <b>220</b> to provide desired strength or properties to certain regions. In some embodiments, the surface layer <b>220</b> may comprise fibers, e.g., unidirectional or bidirectional fibers may be present in the layer <b>220</b>. Where bidirectional fibers are present in the layer <b>220</b>, the fibers may be oriented ninety degrees from each other, forty-five degrees from each other or oriented at other angles relative to each other. In some instances, a first fiber plane may be present in the layer <b>220</b> and a second fiber plane may be present in the layer <b>220</b>. Each of the fiber planes may comprises fibers which are substantially parallel to each other and lie in the same plane. The fibers of the two different fiber planes can be arranged orthogonal to each other, e.g., can be present in a 0/90 orientation if desired.</p>

In certain embodiments, the resin in the surface layer <b>220</b> may include a mixture of resins at least one of which can have a melt flow index substantially the same as a resin present in the core layer <b>210</b>. Mixing of the two resins in the surface layer can alter the overall melt flow index to be different from the melt flow index of the resin or resin mixture in the core layer <b>210</b>. The exact composition of the resin used in the core layer <b>210</b> and the surface layer <b>220</b> may be the same or may be different even when the melt flow indices of the resin the core layer <b>210</b> and the surface layer <b>220</b> are substantially the same.</p>

Where the layers of the surface layer stack have a similar melt flow index, the composition of the resin may be the same or may be different. In some embodiments, at least one of the layers of the surface layer stack can include a resin or reinforcing materials that are present in the core layer. In other embodiments, similar reinforcing materials, e.g., glass fibers, can be present in the core layer and each layer of the surface layer stack.

For certain applications, the composite can be provided in sheet form and may optionally include, in addition to the surface layers, one or more additional layers on one or both surfaces of such sheet. In one illustration, such additional surface or skin layers may be, for example, a film, non-woven scrim, a veil, a woven fabric, or combinations thereof. If desired, the surface layers may be air permeable and can substantially stretch and spread with the composite article during thermoforming and/or molding operations. In addition, such layers may be adhesive, such as a thermoplastic material (e.g., an ethylene acrylic acid copolymer or other such polymers) applied to the surface of the fiber-containing thermoplastic material. Generally, the areal density of the composite article, particularly when in sheet form, varies from about 150 gsm to about 4000 gsm, more particularly about 500 gsm to about 3000 gsm, e.g., about 300 gsm to about 500 gsm, or about 500 gsm to about 750 gsm or about 750 gsm to about 2500 gsm.</p>

In another configuration, the porous core <b>812</b> can comprise open cell structures formed by random crossing over of reinforcing fibers held together, at least in part, by one or more thermoplastic resins, where about 40% to about 100% of the cell structure, for example, are open and allow the flow of air and gases through. In certain examples, the core layer <b>812</b> has a density of about 0.1 gm/cm3 to about 2.25 gm/cm3, more particularly about 0.1 gm/cm3 to about 1.8 gm/cm3, and still more particularly about 0.3 gm/cm3 to about 1.0 gm/cm3.

In another embodiment, the polymer core layer of the composites herein includes about 30% to about 60% by weight of fibers. In some examples, fiber comprising an average length of between about 5 mm and about 25 mm are typically utilized in polymer core.

In another embodiment, reinforcing fibers including an average length of about 5 mm to about 75 mm, or more particularly, about 5 mm to about 50 mm may be used. The components can be agitated for a sufficient time to form a dispersed mixture of the reinforcing fibers and thermoplastic powder in the aqueous foam. The dispersed mixture can then be laid down on any suitable support structure, for example, a wire mesh, and then the water can be evacuated through the support structure forming a web. The web can be dried and heated above the softening temperature of the thermoplastic powder. The web can be cooled and pressed to a predetermined thickness and cooled to produce a polymer core layer having a porosity of greater than 0%, more particularly between about 5% to about 95% by volume.</p>

The gap between the consolidating elements in the consolidation devices can be set to a dimension less than that of the unconsolidated web and greater than that of the web if it were to be fully consolidated, thus allowing the web to expand and remain substantially permeable after passing through the rollers. In one embodiment, the gap can be set to a dimension about 5% to about 10% greater than that of the web if it were to be fully consolidated. A fully consolidated web means a web that is fully compressed and substantially void free.

      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">Certain specific examples are described below to illustrate further some of the novel aspects of the technology described herein.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">A composite article comprising a thermoplastic core layer including a high melt flow index resin with a melt flow index of about 100 g/10 min as measured by ASTM D1238, condition L was used. A polypropylene resin with a melt flow index of about 100 g/10 min. was added with glass fibers to a pulping machine to disperse the fibers in the thermoplastic resin. The resin loading used was 30-70 wt % of the overall weight of the composite article. The dispersion that was formed was used to produce the composite article using a wet process where the dispersion was laid down on a wire mesh, and then the water was evacuated through the support structure forming a web. The web was passed through two sets of nip rollers with the first nip rollers maintained at 150Â° F. and providing 37 psi of pressure, and the second of nip rollers maintained at 100Â° F. and providing 27 psi of pressure. A surface layer was added to each side of the core layer, and the composite article was compressed by passing through a pair of nip rollers. One surface layer was a Xiro 40 gsm skin, and the other surface layer was a Mondi F7 skin.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">Several physical properties of the resulting composite sheet article were measured. The total basis weight of the formed article was about 592 gsm, and the article was about 0.8 mm thick. The article was lofted to provide a modified thickness of about 5.1 mm. The measurements below were made using the modified article.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">A flex method that uses a support span and a downward force was used to determine the various measurements. ASTM D790 describes a standard test method where a test piece is placed across two supports and pushed down in the middle until it breaks or bends a specified distance. The plastic is molded or machined into a rectangular test piece prior to testing. During the test, the force on the test piece and how much the center is pushed down (deflection) is continuously measured. Many different test dimensions can be used but the most common is to test a â inch thick test piece laid across two supports 2 inches apart with a single loading nose in the center. Flexural strength (stress) is a measure of how much force a test bar can support before breaking and is calculated using a three point bending formula. Flexural stress at 5% strain is a measure of the force required to bend the test bar a certain amount and is used when the test bar bends too far without breaking. Flexural modulus is a measure of stiffness or rigidity and is calculated by dividing the change in stress by the change in strain at the beginning of the test.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">In the testing herein, a span width was 100 mm, and a specimen of about 50 mm wide by 150 mm long was placed across the span where a downward force was applied to the top of the specimen using a nose piece at a speed of 50 mm/minute. A plot of applied load versus specimen extension was generated to determine the flexural slope. The test that used the specific parameters above is referred to in certain instances herein as a âModified Flex Test.â</p>
