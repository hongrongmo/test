    <heading id="h-00001-en">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a cleaning composition and, more specifically, to a hard surface cleaning composition containing a polyetheramine that provides benefits in terms of the removal of greasy soils.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The detergent formulator is constantly aiming to improve the performance of detergent compositions. One of the biggest challenges encountered in hard surface cleaning is the removal of greasy soils, in particular the removal of greasy soils from hydrophobic items such as plastic.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The challenge is not only to remove the grease from hydrophobic items but also to leave them feeling not greasy or slippery. Ideally, consumers like to clean items to achieve squeaky cleanness, i.e., the items are so clean that when a finger is slid along the item a squeaky noise is produced. This noise is associated with total cleanness.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The objective of the present invention is to provide a hand dishwashing composition with improved grease soil removal.</p>
    <heading id="h-00003-en">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">According to the first aspect of the invention there is provided a cleaning composition, preferably the composition is a hand dishwashing cleaning composition. The composition is preferably in liquid form. The composition comprises a surfactant system and a polyetheramine selected from the group consisting of polyetheramines of Formula (I), (II), (III) and a mixture thereof.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The composition of the invention provides excellent grease removal, even from hydrophobic items, such as plastics. The composition leaves even plastic items feeling squeaky clean.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The surfactant system of the composition of the invention comprises an anionic surfactant and a primary co-surfactant selected from the group consisting of amphoteric, zwitteronic and mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The anionic surfactant can be any anionic cleaning surfactant, especially preferred anionic surfactants are selected from the group consisting of alkyl sulfate, alkyl alkoxy sufate, alkyl benzene sulfonate, paraffin sulfonate and mixtures thereof. Preferred anionic surfactants are selected from alkyl sulfate, alkyl alkoxy sulfate and mixtures thereof, a preferred alkyl alkoxy sulfate is alkyl ethoxy sulfate. Preferred anionic surfactant for use herein is a mixture of alkyl sulfate and alkyl ethoxy sulfate.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Extremely useful surfactant systems for use herein include those comprising anionic surfactants, in combination with amine oxide, especially alkyl dimethyl amine oxides, and/or betaine surfactants.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Another preferred surfactant system for use herein is an anionic and amphoteric/zwitterionic system in which the amphoteric to zwitterionic weight ratio is preferably from about 2:1 to about 1:2.. In particular a system in which the amphoteric surfactant is an amine oxide surfactant and the zwitteronic surfactant is a betaine and the weight ratio of the amine oxide to the betaine is about 1:1.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Also preferred for use herein are surfactant systems further comprising non-ionic surfactants. Especially preferred nonionic surfactants are alkyl alkoxylated nonionic surfactants, especially alkyl ethoxylated surfactants.</p>

In summary, the most preferred surfactant system for use herein comprises an alkyl alkoxylated sulfate surfactant, amine oxide and non-ionic surfactant, especially an alkyl ethoxylated sulfate surfactant, alkyl dimethyl amine oxide and an alkyl ethoxylate nonionic surfactant.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Preferably, the composition of the invention comprises a salt of a divalent cation. In particular, a salt of magnesium. It has been found that magnesium cations can work in combination with the polyetheramine by strengthening and broadening the grease cleaning profile of the composition. Preferably, the composition of the invention comprises a chelant. It has been found that chelants can act together with the polyetheramine of the invention to provide improved cleaning. Preferred chelants for use herein are aminophosphonate and aminocarboxylated chelants in particular aminocarboxylated chelants such as MGDA and GLDA.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Preferably, the composition of the invention comprises an isothiazolinone based preservative. The polyetheramines present good compatibility with this type of preservatives.</p>

    <heading id="h-00021-en">Preservatives</heading>
    <p id="p-00111-en" num="0111">The composition of the invention preferably comprises a preservative. A preservative is a naturally occurring or synthetically produced substance that is added to detergent compositions to prevent decomposition by microbial growth or by undesirable chemical changes. Preservatives can be divided into two types, depending on their origin. Class I preservatives refers to those preservatives which are naturally occurring, everyday substances. Class II preservatives refer to preservatives which are synthetically manufactured. Most preferred preservatives for use in liquid detergent compositions include derivatives of isothiazolinones, including methylisothiazolinone, methylchloroisothiazolinone, octylisothiazolinone, 1,2-benzisothiazolinone, and mixtures thereof. Other non-limiting examples of preservatives typically used are phenoxyethanol, paraben derivatives such as methyl paraben and propyl paraben, imidazole derivatives, and aldehydes including glutaraldehyde.</p>
    <p id="p-00112-en" num="0112">The detergent composition herein may comprise a number of optional ingredients such as builders, conditioning polymers, cleaning polymers, surface modifying polymers, soil flocculating polymers, structurants, emollients, humectants, skin rejuvenating actives, enzymes, carboxylic acids, scrubbing particles, bleach and bleach activators, perfumes, malodor control agents, pigments, dyes, opacifiers, beads, pearlescent particles, microcapsules, antibacterial agents, enzymes and pH adjusters and buffering means or water or any other dilutents or solvents compatible with the formulation.</p>
    <heading id="h-00022-en">Method of washing</heading>
    <p id="p-00113-en" num="0113">The second aspect of the invention is directed to methods of washing dishware with the composition of the present invention. Said method comprises the step of applying the composition, preferably in liquid form, onto the dishware surface, either in diluted or neat form and rinsing or leaving the composition to dry on the surface without rinsing the surface.</p>
    <p id="p-00114-en" num="0114">By "in its neat form", it is meant herein that said composition is not diluted in a full sink of water. The composition is applied directly onto the surface to be treated and/or onto a cleaning device or implement such as a dish cloth, a sponge or a dish brush without undergoing major dilution (immediately) prior to the application. The cleaning device or implement is preferably wet before or after the composition is delivered to it. Especially good grease removal has been found when the composition is used in neat form. By "diluted form", it is meant herein that said composition is diluted by the user with an appropriate solvent, typically water. By "rinsing", it is meant herein contacting the dishware cleaned using a process according to the present invention with substantial quantities of appropriate solvent, typically water, after the step of applying the liquid composition herein onto said dishware. By "substantial quantities", it is meant usually about 1 to about 10 liters.</p>
    <p id="p-00115-en" num="0115">The composition herein can be applied in its diluted form. Soiled dishes are contacted with an effective amount, typically from about 0.5 ml to about 20 ml (per about 25 dishes being treated), preferably from about 3ml to about 10 ml, of the detergent composition, preferably in liquid form, of the present invention diluted in water. The actual amount of detergent composition used will be based on the judgment of user, and will typically depend upon factors such as the particular product formulation of the composition, including the concentration of active ingredients in the composition, the number of soiled dishes to be cleaned, the degree of soiling on the dishes, and the like. Generally, from about 0.01 ml to about 150 ml, preferably from about 3ml to about 40ml of a liquid detergent composition of the invention is combined with from about 2000 ml to about 20000 ml, more typically from about 5000 ml to about 15000 ml of water in a sink having a volumetric capacity in the range of from about 1000 ml to about 20000 ml, more typically from about 5000 ml to about 15000 ml. The soiled dishes are immersed in the sink containing the diluted compositions then obtained, where contacting the soiled surface of the dish with a cloth, sponge, or similar article cleans them. The cloth, sponge, or similar article may be immersed in the detergent composition and water mixture prior to being contacted with the dish surface, and is typically contacted with the dish surface for a period of time ranged from about 1 to about 10 seconds, although the actual time will vary with each application and user. The contacting of cloth, sponge, or similar article to the dish surface is preferably accompanied by a concurrent scrubbing of the dish surface.</p>
    <p id="p-00116-en" num="0116">Another method of the present invention will comprise immersing the soiled dishes into a water bath or held under running water without any liquid dishwashing detergent. A device for absorbing liquid dishwashing detergent, such as a sponge, is placed directly into a separate quantity of undiluted liquid dishwashing composition for a period of time typically ranging from about 1 to about 5 seconds. The absorbing device, and consequently the undiluted liquid dishwashing composition, is then contacted individually to the surface of each of the soiled dishes to remove said soiling. The absorbing device is typically contacted with each dish surface for a period of time range from about 1 to about 10 seconds, although the actual time of application will be dependent upon factors such as the degree of soiling of the dish. The contacting of the absorbing device to the dish surface is preferably accompanied by concurrent scrubbing.</p>
    <p id="p-00117-en" num="0117">Alternatively, the device may be immersed in a mixture of the hand dishwashing composition and water prior to being contacted with the dish surface, the concentrated solution is made by diluting the hand dishwashing composition with water in a small container that can accommodate the cleaning device at weight ratios ranging from about 95:5 to about 5:95, preferably about 80:20 to about 20:80 and more preferably about 70:30 to about 30:70, respectively, of hand dishwashing liquid:water respectively depending upon the user habits and the cleaning task.</p>

    <p id="p-00130-en" num="0130">Grease (beef fat) is liquefied by heating and polystyrene sticks coated with paraffin wax are dipped in the liquid grease, so that grease-covered sticks are obtained. The grease-covered sticks are stored at 4C for minimum 24 hours. For measuring the grease cleaning performance of the compositions, the grease-covered sticks are placed over a slightly moving/swirling microplate containing 10% wash solutions of the compositions (water hardness: 14dH). The grease-covered sticks are dipping into the test solutions without getting in contact with the walls or bottom of the microplate and are kept in the swirling test solutions during the wash time. The wash temperature is 30C. The turbidity of the test solutions is quantified via measuring the absorbance of the test solutions and from the measured absorbance the cleaning index is calculated: (Absorbance of the test solution with polyetheramine / absorbance of the reference solution without polyetheramine) * 100. The higher the Cleaning Index, the better the grease cleaning performance of the polyetheramine. <tables id="tables-00006-en" num="0006"><table frame="all"><tgroup cols="5"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="39mm" /><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="27mm" /><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="27mm" /><colspec colnum="4" colname="col4" colwidth="29mm" /><colspec colnum="5" colname="col5" colwidth="27mm" /><thead><row><entry align="center" valign="top" /><entry align="center" valign="top"><b>Composition E</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="top">C<b>omposition F</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="top"><b>Composition G</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="top"><b>Composition H</b></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry>Cleaning Index at 15 min</entry><entry align="center">100</entry><entry align="center">121</entry><entry align="center">100</entry><entry align="center">163</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p>
