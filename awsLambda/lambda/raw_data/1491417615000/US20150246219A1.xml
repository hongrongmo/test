No. 9,008,747, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This invention relates generally to the neural interface field, and more specifically to a new and useful neural interface system with an edge array in the neural interface field.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Neural interface systems are typically implantable devices that are placed into biological tissue (e.g., brain or other neural tissue) and have the ability through electrode sites, to record electrical signals from and/or electrically stimulate the tissue. Such neural interface systems may be used, for example, in treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. For instance, deep brain stimulation devices may provide controllable electrical stimulation of selected regions of neural tissue through strategic positioning and activation of electrode sites.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">A neural interface system including a high-density array of electrode sites would he useful in many applications for exceptional control, but utilizing current conventional technology, including more electrode sites typically means a significant increase in thickness and overall size of the implantable device. Generally speaking, the larger the implantable device is, the more damage to tissue (e.g., cortical blood vessels and local tissue in and around the region of interest) the devices inflicts during implantation into the tissue. Furthermore, larger devices typically experience increased incidence of tissue encapsulation, as a result of foreign body response, thereby leading to decreased electrode sensitivity.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Thus, there is a need in the neural interface field to create a new and useful neural interface system that ameliorates or eliminates the issues created by larger devices. High-channel count neural interfaces especially tend to be larger given the cost of decreasing the feature size during fabrication. This invention provides such a neural interface system, which is described in detail below in its preferred embodiments with reference to the appended drawings.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The following description of preferred embodiments of the invention is not intended to limit the invention to these preferred embodiments, but rather to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use this invention.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="2">Neural Interface System</heading>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, in a preferred embodiment, the neural interface system <b>100</b> of a preferred embodiment includes: a substantially cylindrical shaft <b>110</b>; a lateral extension <b>140</b> longitudinally coupled to at least a portion of the shaft <b>110</b> along a longitudinal direction of the shaft <b>110</b> and having a thickness less than a diameter of the shaft <b>110</b>; and an electrode array <b>150</b>, at least partially arranged on the lateral extension <b>140</b> and radially offset from the shaft <b>110</b>, comprising a plurality of electrode sites <b>152</b> that electrically interface with their surroundings. The neural interface system <b>100</b> of the preferred embodiment preferably provides ultra-high density, high-resolution microelectrodes on a shaft <b>110</b> implantable in tissue for electrically communicating with and interfacing with tissue, such as for recording and/or stimulation of targeted tissue. The neural interface system <b>100</b> is preferably used to interact with brain tissue or other neural tissue for research and/or clinical purposes, but additionally or alternatively can be used to interact with any suitable tissue for any suitable application. The electrode array <b>150</b> is preferably radially offset from and is smaller than the shaft <b>110</b>, such that the degree of any tissue damage incurred by implantation of the shaft <b>110</b> will preferably have reduced effect on the electrode recording and/or stimulation quality and longevity. The neural interface system <b>100</b> preferably reduces local tissue damage, such as to cortical blood vessels and damage in the dendritic arbor of local neurons, such as during implantation. The neural interface system <b>100</b> preferably further reduces the occurrence of tissue encapsulation (arid associated biofouling and impedance effects) around the device, which would otherwise degrade the capabilities of the neural interface system <b>100</b>. Furthermore, in one preferred embodiment, the components of the neural interface system are modular, which may help to reduce costs.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The shaft <b>110</b> of the preferred neural interface system <b>100</b> preferably functions to provide structural support for the neural interface system. As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the shaft <b>110</b> of the preferred system <b>100</b> can be configured as a rolled substrate <b>120</b>. The substrate <b>120</b> is preferably a substantially planar substrate <b>120</b> that is rolled into a cylindrical shaft <b>110</b>. Alternatively, the shaft <b>110</b> can be any suitable shape formed by processes other than rolling; for example, the shaft <b>110</b> can be folded into a particular shape, or the shaft <b>110</b> can include a single tube or plurality of nested tubes. The shaft <b>110</b> preferably has substantially circular cross-section taken along a radial direction, but can alternatively have an elliptical or any suitable cross-sectional shape.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In the preferred system <b>100</b>, the substrate <b>120</b> includes a polymer or other suitable material that is flexible enough to be rolled or similarly manipulated. The substrate <b>120</b> preferably includes one or more metallization layers and/or one or more insulation layers interspersed between the metallization layers. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, one or more metallization layers are preferably patterned into conductive traces <b>126</b> within the substrate <b>120</b>. The metallization layers are preferably further patterned into the electrode sites <b>152</b> of the electrode array <b>150</b>, as further described below. In a preferred embodiment, the substrate <b>120</b> includes at least one metallization layer, but the substrate can alternatively include any suitable number of metallization layers. The metallization layers preferably include platinum and/or iridium, but can additionally or alternatively include any suitable conductive or semi-conductive material. The insulation layers preferably include silicon carbide, but may additionally or alternatively include any suitable electrically insulating material such as silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, parylene, polyimide, LCP, and/or silicone. At least some of the layers of the substrate <b>120</b>, such as the metallization layers, may be planarized by chemical-mechanical planarization or another smoothing process. Any additional suitable photolithographic processes can be performed on the substrate as desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the substrate <b>120</b> can further include a bond pad region <b>128</b> that electrically communicates with the conductive traces <b>126</b> and/or electrode array <b>150</b>, and with other circuitry and electronic devices (e.g., controller and/or signal processing devices). The bond pad region <b>128</b> is preferably on a proximal portion of the substrate <b>120</b> (with respect to the system when the system is implanted in tissue). For example, in a preferred embodiment, in an application in which the neural interface system is implanted in brain tissue, the bond pad region <b>128</b> is on or near a proximal end of the shaft <b>110</b>, near or outside the surface of the brain. However, the bond pad region <b>128</b> can alternatively be located in any suitable portion of the substrate, or may be arranged in any suitable position relative to the shaft <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In a variation of the preferred system <b>100</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the shaft <b>110</b> defines a lumen <b>130</b> within its interior space. The lumen <b>130</b> preferably passes longitudinally within the shaft <b>110</b>. In some variations of the preferred system <b>100</b>, the lumen <b>130</b> is centered within the shaft <b>110</b>, and in some variations, the lumen <b>130</b> is offset within the shaft <b>110</b>. The lumen <b>130</b> can function to deliver and/or receive substances or items in different manners in one or more different variations. In another variation of the preferred system, the lumen <b>130</b> is configured to receive and transport a fluid <b>132</b>, such as for fluidic delivery of drugs or other therapeutic molecules to tissue surrounding the implanted shaft <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In another variation of the preferred system <b>100</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the system <b>100</b> includes a stylet <b>134</b> that is insertable in the lumen <b>130</b> and preferably functions to at least provide structural support for the shaft <b>110</b> during implantation. The stylet <b>134</b> preferably includes a sharpened, pointed distal end to aid insertion into tissue and/or adjustment within tissue. In another variation of the preferred system <b>100</b>, the stylet <b>134</b> includes a microwire that is insertable in the lumen <b>130</b> and preferably functions as a single channel microelectrode. In another variation of the preferred system <b>100</b>, the stylet <b>134</b> functions as a mandrel, around which the substrate <b>120</b> is wrapped to form the shaft <b>110</b>, as further described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In another variation of the preferred system <b>100</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the system <b>100</b> further includes an optical light source <b>136</b> that is insertable in the lumen <b>130</b> and preferably functions to facilitate optogenetic stimulation. In particular the optical light source <b>136</b> facilitates optogenetic stimulation using optogenetic tools with light-sensitive ion channels in tissue to perturb neural circuits with cell-type specificity. The optical light source <b>136</b> is preferably an optical fiber, but may alternatively be any suitable light source. In this variation, the optical light source may operate within the neural interface system <b>100</b> similar to that described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2011/0112591 entitled âWaveguide neural interface deviceâ, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by this reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Other variations of the preferred system <b>100</b> can include any other suitable substance, material, insert, and/or machine insertable within the lumen <b>130</b>.

However, any suitable number of metallization layers and/or insulation layers can be deposited. Any suitable deposition technique or process (e.g., chemical vapor deposition) can be used. The metallization layers can be any suitable conductive material, such as platinum or iridium or gold, including appropriate metal adhesion layers.

The actuator is preferably programmed to roll a predetermined portion of the substrate (e.g., to include up to a predetermined length of the substrate in the rolled shaft), thereby leaving a portion of the substrate outside of the rolled shaft. In this embodiment, a first end of the insert is preferably coupled (e.g., with a shaft coupler) to the rotational actuator and a second end of the insert opposite the first end may be mounted to a fixture to help stabilize the insert as the substrate is rolled.

      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">Example Implementation of the Preferred System and Method</heading>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The following example implementation of the preferred system and method is for illustrative purposes only, and should not be construed as definitive or limiting of the scope of the claimed invention. In one example, the shaft includes a polymer substrate having three metallization layers that are approximately 0.7 Î¼m, 1.0 Î¼m, and 1.3 Î¼m thick. The metallization layers are interspersed with silicon carbide insulation layers. A trailing end of the substrate is patterned with photolithographic processes to form a high-density electrode array including approximately 670 microelectrode sites. When the substrate is unrolled, at least a portion of the planar substrate has a width of approximately 450 Î¼m and a thickness of approximately 5 Î¼m. A microwire having a diameter of approximately 80 Î¼m is tacked onto an end of the planar substrate opposite the trailing end, and the planar substrate is rolled or wrapped around the microwire, toward the trailing end, to form a shaft approximately 10 mm long and having a lateral extension projecting tangentially from the shaft. The high-density electrode array is arranged along the edge of the lateral extension such that the electrode array is radially offset from the rolled shaft.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The neural interface system is preferably strategically implanted to minimize damage to a target region of interest in the tissue, especially compared to conventional planar and microwire neural devices. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, a planar neural device can sever portions of a neuron during implantation, and/or can be forced to record and/or stimulate tissue further from a desired target region in order to avoid excessive damage to the target region. As shown in the schematics of FIGS. <b>11</b>C(i)-(iii), an exemplary planar neural device with a width of approximately 100 Î¼m (FIG. <b>11</b>C(i)) and an exemplary microwire neural device with a diameter of approximately 30 Î¼m (FIG. <b>11</b>C(ii)) are estimated to result in a larger area of damage (A<sub>d</sub>) to a desired target region due to their larger footprint area or âeffective widthâ in the target region, compared to the neural interface system with an edge array with an effective width of 5 Î¼m (FIG. <b>11</b>C(iii)). The shaft of the neural interface system is preferably positioned relatively distant from the target region, while the edge electrode array on the lateral extension (which is preferably thinner than the shaft and consequently causes less damage to the surrounding tissue than the shaft) is preferably positioned in the target region of tissue with less damage to the target region. In other words, in this simulated comparison, the neural interface system with an edge array preferably has a substantially smaller effective width, and results in a substantially smaller area of damage (A<sub>d</sub>) than the exemplary planar array neural device (<figref>FIGS. 11D and 11E</figref>) or the exemplary microwire neural device (<figref>FIG. 11E</figref>).</p>
