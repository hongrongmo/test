      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a stabilized injectable pharmaceutical composition of epinephrine or salts thereof comprising sodium metabisulfite, wherein the ratio of the amount of epinephrine or salt thereof to sodium metabisulfite in the composition ranges from about 1:0.005 to about 1:1.5 by weight. It has been observed that stable injectable epinephrine compositions with excellent storage stability and substantially free of overages can be prepared using sodium metabisulfite in said ratios. Particularly, it was found that using sodium metabisulfite in said ratios controls levels of adrenaline sulfonate impurity in said pharmaceutical compositions.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a sympathomimetic catecholamine. Chemically, epinephrine is B-(3,4dihydroxyphenyl)-a-methyl-amino ethanol.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Epinephrine is the drug of choice for the initial treatment of anaphylaxis. Many epinephrine products are commerically available currently. For instance, epinephrine is marketed in the United States in the form of intramuscular and subcutaneous injection under trade name TwinjectÂ®, Auvi-QÂ®, EpiPenÂ® Auto-Injector, which contains 0.3 mg epinephrine, and EpiPenÂ® Jr Auto-Injector, which contains 0.15 mg epinephrine.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">It is well known in the art that there is an issue with potency of epinephrine (both in free base form and ionic form) when used in presence of oxygen and free radicals i.e degradation of epinephrine is accelerated in the presence of oxygen and free radicals.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Numerous studies have been conducted to address the effect of formulation variables on the epinephrine degradation kinetics, and attempts have been made to improve the formulation stability.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 3,149,035 discloses use of bisulphite and boric acid to enhance stability of the catechol amines.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 3,966,905 discloses catecholamine solutions at mild pH are suitable for physiological use.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Several literatures suggests that there is an increase in stability of epinephrine when stored in gas-tight containers with an inert gas (e.g. nitrogen) purging, and/or limiting or protecting the epinephrine formulation from direct light exposure or storing in a secondary opaque package. Inspite of using sodium metabisulfite controlling the degradation of epinephrine however continues to be an issue. In addition, interaction of sodium metabisulfite with epinephrine further leads to complications.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Currently marketed products of epinephrine as discussed above includes sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant as it prevents degradation of the product due to oxidation that may take place during manufacturing, filling, storage, and environmental influence on the formulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Currently marketed products of epinephrine i.e EpiPenÂ® Auto-Injector containing 0.3 mg epinephrine and EpiPenÂ® Jr Auto-Injector containing 0.15 mg of epinephrine comprises of same amount of sodium metabisulfite i.e. 0.5 mg. It is also observed that EpiPenÂ® Jr Auto-Injector product generally degrades relatively faster than that in EpiPenÂ® Auto-Injector, presumably due to exposure of the product to substantial vacant space left in the cartridge.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Moreover, Currently marketed products of epinephrine i.e the EpiPenÂ® Auto-Injector products contains more than about 20% of the epinephrine overages. This is in order to compensate the amount of epinephrine degraded during manufacture or over storage. Such overages however, may either lead to undesirable side effects due to dose inaccuracy or generate more degradation products in the product.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Further, currently marketed products contain 0.3 mg or 0.15 mg in 2.0 ml solution, of which only 0.3 ml is injected and rest 1.7 ml is discarded, which leads to lots of wastage.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Since said product is used in severe anaphylactic reactions, so controlling impurities and improvement of stability is critical. Hence, there exists an enduring need for improved and stable pharmaceutical composition of epinephrine, which exhibits excellent storage stability and does not require addition of epinephrine overages.</p>

      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The inventors of the present invention have surprisingly found that while making an injectable composition of epinephrine, amount of sodium metabisulfite plays a critical role in order to control degradation due to oxidation as well as in controlling impurities. It was surprisingly found that epinephrine reacts with sodium metabisulfite, thereby leading to formation of adrenaline sulfonate impurity. In particular, the inventors have found that judicial amount of sodium metabisulfite can effectively curb the oxidation of epinephrine and eventually control generation of sulfonate impurity along with a wide range of several other epinephrine impurities. As a result, inventors of the present invention have found a novel way of preparing the injectable pharmaceutical composition of epinephrine which can exhibit excellent storage stability.</p>

      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0066">Sodium chloride was dissolved in water for injection under continuous nitrogen sparging. 1N HCl solution was added to adjust the pH. Epinephrine and sodium metabisulfite were sequentially added to the solution under stirring to get clear solution. Final volume of the solution was made with water for injection. pH of the final solution can be adjusted using HCl solution if required. The solution was then subjected to filtration through 0.22Î¼ membrane filter. The solution was then filled in sterile 1 mL pre-filled syringes.</p>
