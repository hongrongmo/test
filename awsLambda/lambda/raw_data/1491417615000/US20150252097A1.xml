      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to innovative proteins that bind to insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), as well as other important proteins. The invention also relates to innovative proteins in pharmaceutical preparations and derivatives of such proteins and the uses of same in diagnostic, research and therapeutic applications. The invention further relates to cells comprising such proteins, polynucleotide encoding such proteins or fragments thereof, and to vectors comprising the polynucleotides encoding the innovative proteins.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) is a transmembrane heterotetrameric protein, which has two extracellular alpha chains and two membrane-spanning beta chains in a disulfide-linked beta-alpha-alpha-beta. configuration. The binding of the ligands, such as insulin-like growth-factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II), by the extracellular domain of IGF-IR receptor activates it and in many instances its intracellular tyrosine kinase domain resulting in autophosphorylation of the receptor and substrate phosphorylation.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">IGF-IR is homologous to the insulin receptor, having a high sequence similarity of 84% in the beta chain tyrosine kinase domain and a low sequence similarity of 48% in the alpha chain extracellular cysteine rich domain (Ulrich, A. et al., 1986, EMBO, 5, 2503-2512; Fujita-Yamaguchi, Y. et al., 1986, J. Biol. Chem., 261, 16727-16731; LeRoith, D. et al., 1995, Endocrine Reviews, 16, 143-163). The IGF-IR and ligands (IGF-I and IGF-II) play important roles in numerous physiological processes including growth and development during embryogenesis, metabolism, cellular proliferation and cell differentiation in adults (LeRoith, D., 2000, Endocrinology, 141, 1287-1288; LeRoith, D., 1997, New England J. Med., 336, 633-640).</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">IGF-I and IGF-II ligands function both as endocrine hormones in the blood, where they are predominantly present in complexes with IGF-binding proteins, and as paracrine and autocrine growth factors that are produced locally (Humbel, R. E., 1990, Eur. J. Biochem., 190, 445-462; Cohick, W. S. and Clemmons, D. R., 1993, Annu. Rev. Physiol. 55, 131-153).</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In vivo, serum levels of IGF-I are dependent upon the presence of pituitary growth hormone (GH). Although the liver is a major site of GH dependent IGF-I synthesis, a large number of extrahepatic tissues also produce IGF-I (Daughaday and Rotwein, Endocrine Rev. 10:68-91 (1989). A variety of neoplastic tissues may also produce IGF-I (Werner and LeRoith, Adv. Cancer Res. 68:183-223 (1996). Thus IGF-I may act as a regulator of normal and abnormal cellular proliferation via autocrine or paracrine, as well as endocrine mechanisms. IGF-I and IGF-II bind to IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) in vivo. Upon binding to IGFs the IGFBPs either transport IGFs through the circulation or they may protect IGFs from proteolytic cleavage and inactivation. The availability of free IGF for interaction with the IGF-IR is modulated by the IGFBPs. For a review of IGFBPs and IGF-I, see Grimberg et al., J. Cell. Physiol. 183: 1-9, 2000.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">At a molecular level IGF-IR has been implicated in promoting growth, transformation and survival of tumor cells (Baserga, R. et al., 1997, Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 1332, F105-F126; Blakesley, V. A. et al., 1997, Journal of Endocrinology, 152, 339-344; Kaleko, M., Rutter, W. J., and Miller, A. D. 1990, Mol. Cell. Biol., 10, 464-473). Several types of tumors are known to express higher than normal levels of IGF-IR, including breast cancer, colon cancer, ovarian carcinoma, synovial sarcoma and pancreatic cancer. See Khandwala, H. M. et al., 2000, Endocrine Reviews, 21, 215-244; Werner, H. and LeRoith, D., 1996, Adv. Cancer Res., 68, 183-223; Happerfield, L. C. et al., 1997, J. Pathol., 183, 412-417; Frier, S. et al., 1999, Gut, 44, 704-708; van Dam, P. A. et al., 1994, J. Clin. Pathol., 47, 914-919; Xie, Y. et al., 1999, Cancer Res., 59, 3588-3591; Bergmann, U. et al., 1995, Cancer Res., 55, 2007-2011.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In vitro, IGF-I and IGF-II have been shown to be potent mitogens for several human tumor cell lines such as lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, osteosarcoma and cervical cancer (Ankrapp, D. P. and Bevan, D. R., 1993, Cancer Res., 53, 3399-3404; Cullen, K. J., 1990, Cancer Res., 50, 48-53; Hermanto, U. et al., 2000, Cell Growth &amp; Differentiation, 11, 655-664; Guo, Y. S. et al., 1995, J. Am. Coll. Surg., 181, 145-154; Kappel, C. C. et al., 1994, Cancer Res., 54, 2803-2807; Steller, M. A. et al., 1996, Cancer Res., 56, 1761-1765). Several of these tumors and tumor cell lines also express high levels of IGF-I or IGF-II, which may stimulate their growth in an autocrine or paracrine manner (Quinn, K. A. et al., 1996, J. Biol. Chem., 271, 11477-11483).</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Epidemiological studies have shown a correlation of elevated plasma level of IGF-I (and lower level of IGF-binding protein-3) with increased risk for prostate cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer and breast cancer (Chan, J. M. et al., 1998, Science, 279, 563-566; Wolk, A. et al., 1998, J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 90, 911-915; Ma, J. et al., 1999, J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 91, 620-625; Yu, H. et al., 1999, J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 91, 151-156; Hankinson, S. E. et al., 1998, Lancet, 351, 1393-1396). Strategies to lower the IGF-I level in plasma or to inhibit the function of IGF-IR have been suggested for cancer prevention (Wu, Y. et al., 2002, Cancer Res., 62, 1030-1035; Grimberg, A and Cohen P., 2000, J. Cell. Physiol., 183, 1-9).</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">IGF-IR can protect tumor cells from apoptosis caused by growth factor deprivation, anchorage independence or cytotoxic drug treatment (Navarro, M. and Baserga, R., 2001, Endocrinology, 142, 1073-1081; Baserga, R. et al., 1997, Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 1332, F105-F126). Domains of IGF-IR that are critical for its mitogenic, transforming and anti-apoptotic activities have been identified by mutational analysis. For example, the tyrosine 1251 residue of IGF-IR has been identified as critical for anti-apoptotic and transformation activities but not for its mitogenic activity (O'Connor, R. et al., 1997, Mol. Cell. Biol., 17, 427-435; Miura, M. et al., 1995, J. Biol. Chem., 270, 22639-22644).</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="2">Difficulty of Making a Therapeutic Based on IGF-IR Antagonism or Inhibition</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">While IGF-IR has attractive biology as a therapeutic target, attempts to make antagonists or other types of inhibitors have been slow, largely due to one or more of the following factors depending on the therapeutic paradigm: difficulty or inability to antagonize the target without agonism; difficulty or inability to make selective antagonists or inhibitors due to undesired cross reactivity with other tyrosine kinase targets or receptors, such as the insulin receptor; difficulty in effective administration due to short half life of the potential therapeutic; difficulty in effective administration due to low solubility of the potential therapeutic; and difficulty in effective administration due to aggregation of the potential therapeutic. Therapeutics of the invention traverse one or more of these difficulties.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Tumor cells expressing an antisense to the IGF-IR mRNA undergo massive apoptosis when injected into animals in biodiffusion chambers. This observation makes the IGF-IR an attractive therapeutic target, based upon the hypothesis that tumor cells are more susceptible than normal cells to apoptosis by inhibition of IGF-IR (Resnicoff, M. et al., 1995, Cancer Res., 55, 2463-2469; Baserga, R., 1995, Cancer Res., 55, 249-252). However, both antisense and siRNA therapeutic strategies suffer from administration challenges and potential cost of goods obstacles.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Another strategy to inhibit the function of IGF-IR in tumor cells has been to use anti-IGF-IR antibodies that bind to the extracellular domain of IGF-IR and which may inhibit activation. Several attempts have been reported to develop mouse monoclonal antibodies against IGF-IR, of which two inhibitory antibodiesâIR3 and 1H7âare available and their use has been reported in several IGF-IR studies.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The IR3 antibody was developed using a partially purified placental preparation of insulin receptor to immunize mice, which yielded an antibody, IR1, that was selective for binding insulin receptor, and two antibodies, IR2 and IR3, that showed preferential immunoprecipitation of IGF-IR (somatomedin-C receptor) but also weak immunoprecipitation of insulin receptor (Kull, F. C. et al., 1983, J. Biol. Chem., 258, 6561-6566).</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="2">Exemplary Deficiencies of Antibodies</heading>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In some cases, antibodies activate IGF-IR. This has been shown a number of times in the literature. In addition, antibodies that are shown to âinhibitâ may not have been carefully characterized and may actually activate IGF-IR under certain conditions, such as lower antibody concentrations. In a tumor where there is a likely diffusion gradient of antibody, activation of IGF-IR could occur with antibodies at lower concentrations of antibody in the tumor.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The 1H7 antibody was developed by immunizing mice with purified placental preparation of IGF-IR, which yielded an inhibitory antibody 1H7 in addition to three stimulatory antibodies (Li, S.-L. et al., 1993, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 196, 92-98; Xiong, L. et al., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89, 5356-5360).</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In another report, a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for human IGF-IR was obtained by immunization of mice with transfected 3T3 cells expressing high levels of IGF-IR, which were categorized into seven groups by binding competition studies and by their inhibition or stimulation of IGF-I binding to transfected 3T3 cells (Soos, M. A. et al., 1992, J. Biol. Chem., 267, 12955-12963).</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Although IR3 antibody is the most commonly used inhibitory antibody for IGF-IR studies in vitro, it suffers from the drawback that it exhibits agonistic activity in transfected 3T3 and CHO cells expressing human IGF-IR (Kato, H. et al., 1993, J. Biol. Chem., 268, 2655-2661; Steele-Perkins, G. and Roth, R. A., 1990, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 171, 1244-1251). Similarly, among the panel of antibodies developed by Soos et al., the most inhibitory antibodies 24-57 and 24-60 also showed agonistic activities in the transfected 3T3 cells (Soos, M. A. et al., 1992, J. Biol. Chem., 267, 12955-12963). Although, IR3 antibody has been reported to inhibit the binding of IGF-I (but not IGF-II) to expressed receptors in intact cells and after solubilization, it has been shown to inhibit the ability of both IGF-I and IGF-II to stimulate DNA synthesis in cells in vitro (Steele-Perkins, G. and Roth, R. A., 1990, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 171, 1244-1251). The binding epitope of IR3 antibody has been inferred from chimeric insulin-IGF-IR constructs to be the 223-274 region of IGF-IR (Gustafson, T. A. and Rutter, W. J., 1990, J. Biol. Chem., 265, 18663-18667; Soos, M. A. et al., 1992, J. Biol. Chem., 267, 12955-12963).</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line is typically used as a model cell line to demonstrate the growth response of IGF-I and IGF-II in vitro (Dufourny, B. et al., 1997, J. Biol. Chem., 272, 31163-31171). In MCF-7 cells, the IR3 antibody incompletely blocks the stimulatory effect of exogenously added IGF-I and IGF-II in serum-free conditions by approximately 80%. Also, the IR3 antibody does not significantly inhibit (less than 25%) the growth of MCF-7 cells in 10% serum (Cullen, K. J. et al., 1990, Cancer Res., 50, 48-53). This weak inhibition of serum-stimulated growth of MCF-7 cells by IR3 antibody in vitro may be related to the results of an in vivo study in which IR3 antibody treatment did not significantly inhibit the growth of a MCF-7 xenograft in nude mice (Arteaga, C. L. et al., 1989, J. Clin. Invest., 84, 1418-1423).</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Because of the weak agonistic activities of the IR3 and other reported antibodies, and their inability to significantly inhibit the growth of tumor cells such as MCF-7 cells in the more physiological condition of serum-stimulation (instead of stimulation by exogenously added IGF-I or IGF-II in serum-free condition), there is a need for new anti-IGF-IR modulators that could inhibit the serum-stimulated growth of tumor cells without significant agonistic activity by themselves. Although, in some instances, agonist activity will be desired, usually for applications outside of oncology or mis-controlled or undesired tissue expansion, proliferation, or growth.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Although anti-IGF-IR antibodies have been reported present in certain patients with autoimmune diseases, none of these antibodies has been purified and none has been shown to be suitable for inhibiting IGF-I activity for diagnostic or clinical procedures. See, e.g., Thompson et al., Pediat. Res. 32: 455 459, 1988; Tappy et al., Diabetes 37: 1708-1714, 1988; Weightman et al., Autoimmunity 16:251-257, 1993; Drexhage et al., Nether. J. of Med. 45:285-293, 1994. Additionally, monoclonal antibodies against the IGF-1R have been reported with can stimulate cell proliferation (Xiong et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:5356-5360, 1992).</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Additionally, it has been historically difficult to make antibodies and other therapeutics due to specificity, agonism, aggregation and solubility, as well as bi-specific therapeutics that include IGF-IR as a target, particularly with using antibodies.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="2">Exemplary Deficiencies of Small Molecule Inhibitors</heading>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Small molecule chemistry programs have largely not been successful in creating a therapeutic to IGF-IR. The druggability of this target by proteins and small molecules has been difficult for a number of reasons including the ability to obtain selective chemistry for IGF-IR while not inhibiting or binding to related tyrosine kinases or receptors, such as the insulin receptor. In addition, the small molecules are often of low solubility making bioavailability, administration or formulation challenging.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">Apoptosis and IGF-IR</heading>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">One of many aspects of the invention is for a polypeptide of the invention to selectively bind to IGF-IR to trigger apoptosis in the cells of a desired tissue, such as a tumor. IGF-IR biology, including activation, contributes to the regulation of apoptosis. It can slow or prevent apoptosis. Suppression of the apoptotic program by a variety of genetic lesions may contribute to the development and progression of malignancies.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Current potential therapeutic strategies, although capable of inducing apoptosis in vitro or for inhibiting in vitro cell proliferation associated with increased IGF-I, increased IGF-II, and/or increased IGF-IR receptor levels include suppressing IGF-I levels or IGF-II levels or preventing the binding of IGF-I to the IGF-IR, remain unsuitable for better therapeutics. For example, the long acting somatostatin analogue octreotide has been employed to reduce IGF synthesis and/or secretion. Soluble IGF-IR has been used to induce apoptosis in tumor cells in vivo and inhibit tumorigenesis in an experimental animal system (D'Ambrosio et al., Cancer Res. 56: 4013-20, 1996). In addition, IGF-IR antisense oligonucleotides, peptide analogues of IGF-I, and antibodies to IGF-IR have been used to decrease IGF-I or IGF-IR expression (see supra). However, none of these agents has been suitable for longer-term administration to human patients. In addition, although IGF-I has been administered to patients for treatment of short stature, osteoporosis, decreased muscle mass, neuropathy or diabetes, the binding of IGF-I to IGFBPs has often made treatment with IGF-I difficult or ineffective. In view of the roles that IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF-IR have in disorders, including cancer and proliferative disorders, such as when IGF-I or IGF-II and/or IGF-IR are over-expressed, and the deficiencies of other therapeutic approaches (e.g., small molecules, siRNA, antisense and antibodies), it would be desirable to generate therapeutics, such as polypeptides of the invention, to the IGF-IR pathway (or various isoforms or mutants of the receptor or its ligands) that could selectively modulate, inhibit or block IGF-IR.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In addition, it would be desirable for such a polypeptide to be expressed in a cost effective manner, possess desirable biophysical properties (e.g., Tm, substantially monomeric, or well folded), small size to penetrate tissues and proper half life or in vivo exposure time in blood over the binding affinity for IGF-IR or other targets.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">One aspect of the invention relates to novel polypeptides that bind IGF-IR with high affinity. In some embodiments, the polypeptides bind IGF-IR with a disassociation constant of about 1 Î¼M or less, about 10 nM or less, or about 1 nM or less. In some embodiments, the polypeptides bind to the insulin receptor with a disassociation constant of about 1 Î¼M or more. In some embodiments, the polypeptide of the invention inhibits the binding of IGF-I or IGF-II to IGF-IR and does not activate human IGF-IR at sub IC50 concentrations in a cell-based assay with an IC50 of less than about 1 nM or about 100 pM. In some embodiments, the polypeptide of the invention induces apoptosis in a cell based assay in a cell line dependent on IGF-IR activation. In some embodiments, IGF-IR binders block IGF-IR activities such as control of apoptosis, phosphorylation or dimerization.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">It will be often desirable, particularly in in vivo applications, that proteins of the invention targeting IGF-IR either as a mono-specific therapeutic or multi-specific (including bi-specific or tri-specific) therapeutics are selective over IGF-IR compared to the insulin receptor. Such selectivity is preferably at least about 100 times, at least about 1000 times, at least about 10,000 times and at least about 100,000 times. In addition, it my be desirable, particularly for proteins with high affinity to IGF-IR to not detectably bind the insulin receptor at a defined concentration or lower of therapeutic or protein, such concentrations are about 100 nM, about 1 uM, or about 10 uM. Selectivity relationships of proteins that bind to IGF-IR over the insulin receptor may also be expressed by comparing Kd, IC50, and Ki's either as measured or calculated depending on the assay; or as a ratio of the same biochemical or biological parameters (e.g., Kd, IC50, and Ki's). Such ratios preferably include ratios of insulin receptor binding or other measurement to IGF-IR binding or other measurement of about 100, about 1,000, about 10,000 or about 100,000. Other proteins of the invention that bind to other targets, particularly tyrosine kinase receptors, preferably are selective for the desired target (e.g., EGFR or Her2) compared to the insulin receptor using the selectivity guidance provided herein.</p>

      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="1">Definitions</heading>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">The methodology described herein has been successfully used to develop proteins of the invention, that include but are not limited to, single domain IGF-IR binding polypeptides derived from at least two related groups of protein structures: those proteins having an immunoglobulin fold and those proteins having an immunoglobulin-like fold.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">By a âpolypeptideâ is meant any sequence of two or more amino acids, regardless of length, post-translation modification, or function. âPolypeptide,â âpeptide,â and âproteinâ are used interchangeably herein. Polypeptides can include natural amino acids and non-natural amino acids such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,559,126, incorporated herein by reference. Polypeptides can also be modified in any of a variety of standard chemical ways (e.g., an amino acid can be modified with a protecting group; the carboxy-terminal amino acid can be made into a terminal amide group; the amino-terminal residue can be modified with groups to, e.g., enhance lipophilicity; or the polypeptide can be chemically glycosylated or otherwise modified to increase stability or in vivo half-life). Polypeptide modifications can include the attachment of another structure such as a cyclic compound or other molecule to the polypeptide and can also include polypeptides that contain one or more amino acids in an altered configuration (i.e., R or S; or, L or D). The term âsingle domain polypeptideâ is used to indicate that the target binding activity (e.g., IGF-IR binding activity) of the subject polypeptide is situated within a single structural domain, as differentiated from, for example, antibodies and single chain antibodies, where antigen binding activity is generally contributed by both a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain. It is contemplated that a plurality of single domain polypeptides of the sort disclosed herein could be connected to create a composite molecule with increased avidity. Likewise, a single domain polypeptide may be attached (e.g., as a fusion protein) to any number of other polypeptides, such as fluorescent polypeptides, targeting polypeptides and polypeptides having a distinct therapeutic effect.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">The term âPKâ is an acronym for âpharmokineticâ and encompasses properties of a compound including, by way of example, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination by a subject. A âPK modulation proteinâ or âPK moietyâ refers to any protein, peptide, or moiety that affects the pharmokinetic properties of a biologically active molecule when fused to or administered together with the biologically active molecule. Examples of a PK modulation protein or PK moiety include PEG, human serum albumin (HSA) binders (as disclosed in U.S. Publication Nos. 20050287153 and 20070003549), human serum albumin, Fc or Fc fragments, and sugars (e.g., sialic acid).</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">Single domain polypeptides of either the immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin-like scaffold will tend to share certain structural features. For example, the polypeptide may comprise between about 80 and about 150 amino acids, which amino acids are structurally organized into a set of beta or beta-like strands, forming beta sheets, where the beta or beta-like strands are connected by intervening loop portions. Examples of the structural organization for the heavy chain variable domain and the <sup>10</sup>Fn3 domain are shown in <figref>FIG. 24</figref>. The beta sheets form the stable core of the single domain polypeptides, while creating two âfacesâ composed of the loops that connect the beta or beta-like strands. As described herein, these loops can be varied to create customized ligand binding sites, and, with proper control, such variations can be generated without disrupting the overall stability of the protein. In antibodies, three of these loops are the well-known Complementarity Determining Regions (or âCDRsâ).</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">Scaffolds for formation of a single domain polypeptides should be highly soluble and stable in physiological conditions. Examples of immunoglobulin scaffolds are the single domain V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>L </sub>scaffold, as well as a single domain camelid V<sub>HH </sub>domain (a form of variable heavy domain found in camelids) or other immunoglobulin variable domains found in nature or engineered in the laboratory. In the single domain format disclosed herein, an immunoglobulin polypeptide need not form a dimer with a second polypeptide in order to achieve binding activity. Accordingly, any such polypeptides that naturally contain a cysteine which mediates disulfide cross-linking to a second protein can be altered to eliminate the cysteine. Alternatively, the cysteine may be retained for use in conjugating additional moieties, such as PEG, to the single domain polypeptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">Other scaffolds may be non-antibody scaffold proteins. By ânon-antibody scaffold protein or domainâ is meant a non-antibody polypeptide having an immunoglobulin-like fold. By âimmunoglobulin-like foldâ is meant a protein domain of between about 80-150 amino acid residues that includes two layers of antiparallel beta-sheets, and in which the flat, hydrophobic faces of the two beta-sheets are packed against each other. An example of such a scaffold is the âfibronectin-based scaffold proteinâ, by which is meant a polypeptide based on a fibronectin type III domain (Fn3). An example of fibronectin-based scaffold proteins are Adnectinsâ¢ (Adnexus Therapeutics, Inc.). Fibronectin is a large protein which plays essential roles in the formation of extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions; it consists of many repeats of three types (types I, II, and III) of small domains (Baron et al., 1991). Fn3 itself is the paradigm of a large subfamily which includes portions of cell adhesion molecules, cell surface hormone and cytokine receptors, chaperoning, and carbohydrate-binding domains. For reviews see Bork &amp; Doolittle, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1992 Oct. 1; 89(19):8990-4; Bork et al., J Mol Biol. 1994 Sep. 30; 242(4):309-20; Campbell &amp; Spitzfaden, Structure. 1994 May 15; 2(5):333-7; Harpez &amp; Chothia, J Mol Biol. 1994 May 13; 238(4):528-39).</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">Preferably, the fibronectin-based scaffold protein is a â10Fn3â scaffold, by which is meant a polypeptide variant based on the tenth module of the human fibronectin type III protein in which one or more of the solvent accessible loops has been randomized or mutated, particularly one or more of the three loops identified as the BC loop (amino acids 23-30), DE loop (amino acids 52-56) and FG loop (amino acids 77-87) (the numbering scheme is based on the sequence on the wild-type tenth module of the human fibronectin type III domain: VSDVPRDLEVVAATPTSLLISWDAPAVTVRYYRITYGETGGNSPVQEFTVPGSKSTAT ISGLKPGVDYTITVYAVTGRGDSPASSKPISINYRT (SEQ ID NO:1). Preferably, fibronectin-based scaffold proteins are based on SEQ ID NO:1.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">A variety of mutant 10Fn3 scaffolds have been reported. In one aspect, one or more of Asp 7, Glu 9, and Asp 23 is replaced by another amino acid, such as, for example, a non-negatively charged amino acid residue (e.g., Asn, Lys, etc.). These mutations have been reported to have the effect of promoting greater stability of the mutant 10Fn3 at neutral pH as compared to the wild-type form (See, PCT Publication No. WO02/04523). A variety of additional alterations in the 10Fn3 scaffold that are either beneficial or neutral have been disclosed. See, for example, Batori et al., Protein Eng. 2002 December; 15(12):1015-20; Koide et al., Biochemistry 2001 Aug. 28; 40(34):10326-33.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">Both variant and wild-type <sup>10</sup>Fn3 proteins are characterized by the same structure, namely seven beta-strand domain sequences designated A through G and six loop regions (AB loop, BC loop, CD loop, DE loop, EF loop, and FG loop) which connect the seven beta-strand domain sequences. The beta strands positioned closest to the N- and C-termini may adopt a beta-like conformation in solution. In SEQ ID NO:1, the AB loop corresponds to residues 15-16, the BC loop corresponds to residues 22-30, the CD loop corresponds to residues 39-45, the DE loop corresponds to residues 51-55, the EF loop corresponds to residues 60-66, and the FG loop corresponds to residues 76-87. As shown in <figref>FIG. 24</figref>, the BC loop, DE loop, and FG loop are all located at the same end of the polypeptide. Similarly, immunoglobulin scaffolds tend to have at least seven beta or beta-like strands, and often nine beta or beta-like strands. Fibronectin-based scaffold proteins can include other Fn3 type fibronectin domains as long as they exhibit useful activities and properties similar to <sup>10</sup>Fn3 type domains.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">A single domain polypeptide disclosed herein may have at least five to seven beta or beta-like strands distributed between at least two beta sheets, and at least one loop portion connecting two beta or beta-like strands, which loop portion participates in binding to IGF-IR, with the binding characterized by a dissociation constant that is less than 1Ã10<sup>â6</sup>M, and preferably less than 1Ã10<sup>â8</sup>M. As described herein, polypeptides having a dissociation constant of less than 5Ã10<sup>â9</sup>M are particularly desirable for therapeutic use in vivo to inhibit ligand signaling. Polypeptides having a dissociation constant of between 1Ã10<sup>â6</sup>M and 5Ã10<sup>â9</sup>M may be desirable for use in detecting or labeling, ex vivo or in vivo, IGF-IR proteins.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">Optionally, the âIGF-IR binding proteinâ will bind specifically to IGF-IR relative to other related proteins from the same species. By âspecifically bindsâ is meant a polypeptide that recognizes and interacts with a target protein (e.g., IGF-IR) but that does not substantially recognize and interact with other molecules in a sample, for example, a biological sample. In preferred embodiments a polypeptide of the invention will specifically bind a IGF-IR with a K<sub>D </sub>at least as tight as 500 nM. Preferably, the polypeptide will specifically bind a IGF-IR with a K<sub>D </sub>of 1 pM to 500 nM, more preferably 1 pM to 100 nM, more preferably 1 pM to 10 nM, and most preferably 1 pM to 1 nM or lower.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">A âfunctional Fc regionâ possesses at least one âeffector functionâ of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary âeffector functionsâ include C1q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g., B cell receptor; BCR), etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain (e.g., an antibody variable domain) and can be assessed using various assays known in the art for evaluating such antibody effector functions.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">A ânative sequence Fc regionâ comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. <figref>FIG. 3</figref> provides amino acid sequences of native sequence human and murine IgG Fc regions.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0110">A âvariant Fc regionâ comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide, e.g., from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80% sequence identity with a native sequence Fc region and/or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide, and most preferably at least about 90% sequence identity therewith, more preferably at least about 95% sequence identity therewith.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0111">âAntibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicityâ and âADCCâ refer to a cell-mediated reaction in which nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc receptors (FcRs) (e.g., Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcÎ³RIII only, whereas monocytes express FcÎ³RI, FcÎ³RII and FcÎ³RIII FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol 9:457-92 (1991). To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. PNAS (USA) 95:652-656 (1998).</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0112">âPercent (%) amino acid sequence identityâ herein is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in a selected sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN, ALIGN-2 or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full-length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are obtained as described below by using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc. has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087, and is publicly available through Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0113">For purposes herein, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows: 100 times the fraction X/Y where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0114">A âpolypeptide chainâ is a polypeptide wherein each of the domains thereof is joined to other domain(s) by peptide bond(s), as opposed to non-covalent interactions or disulfide bonds.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0115">An âisolatedâ polypeptide is one that has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the polypeptide, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of polypeptide as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated polypeptide includes the polypeptide in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the polypeptide's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated polypeptide will be prepared by at least one purification step.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0116">Targets may also be fragments of said targets. Thus a target is also a fragment of said target, capable of eliciting an immune response. A target is also a fragment of said target, capable of binding to a single domain antibody raised against the full length target.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0117">A fragment as used herein refers to less than 100% of the sequence (e.g., 99%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10% etc.), but comprising 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or more amino acids. A fragment is of sufficient length such that the interaction of interest is maintained with affinity of 1.times.10.sup.-6M or better.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0118">A fragment as used herein also refers to optional insertions, deletions and substitutions of one or more amino acids which do not substantially alter the ability of the target to bind to a single domain antibody raised against the wild-type target. The number of amino acid insertions deletions or substitutions is preferably up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 or 70 amino acids.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0119">A protein of the invention that âinduces cell deathâ is one which causes a viable cell to become nonviable. The cell is generally one which expresses the antigen to which the protein binds, especially where the cell overexpresses the antigen. Preferably, the cell is a cancer cell, e.g., a breast, ovarian, stomach, endometrial, salivary gland, lung, kidney, colon, thyroid, pancreatic or bladder cell. In vitro, the cell may be, for example, a SKBR3, BT474, Calu 3, MDA-MB453, MDA-MB-361 or SKOV3 cell. Cell death in vitro may be determined in the absence of complement and immune effector cells to distinguish cell death induced by antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Thus, the assay for cell death may be performed using heat inactivated serum (i.e., in the absence of complement) and in the absence of immune effector cells. To determine whether the protein of the invention is able to induce cell death, loss of membrane integrity as evaluated by uptake of propidium iodide (PI), trypan blue (see Moore et al. Cytotechnology 17:1-11 (1995)) or 7AAD can be assessed relative to untreated cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0120">A protein of the invention that âinduces apoptosisâ is one that induces programmed cell death as determined by binding of apoptosis related molecules or events, such as annexin V, fragmentation of DNA, cell shrinkage, dilation of endoplasmic reticulum, cell fragmentation, and/or formation of membrane vesicles (called apoptotic bodies). The cell is one which expresses the antigen to which the protein binds and may be one which overexpresses the antigen. The cell may be a tumor cell, e.g. a breast, ovarian, stomach, endometrial, salivary gland, lung, kidney, colon, thyroid, pancreatic or bladder cell. In vitro, the cell may be, for example, SKBR3, BT474, Calu 3 cell, MDA-MB453, MDA-MB-361 or SKOV3 cell. Various methods are available for evaluating the cellular events associated with apoptosis. For example, phosphatidyl serine (PS) translocation can be measured by annexin binding; DNA fragmentation can be evaluated through DNA laddering as disclosed in the example herein; and nuclear/chromatin condensation along with DNA fragmentation can be evaluated by any increase in hypodiploid cells. Preferably, the protein that induces apoptosis is one which results in about 2 to 50 fold, preferably about 5 to 50 fold, and most preferably about 10 to 50 fold, induction of annexin binding relative to untreated cell in an annexin binding assay using cells expressing the antigen to which the protein of the invention binds.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">The term âtherapeutically effective amountâ refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat a disease or disorder in a mammal. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the disorder. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy in vivo can, for example, be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and/or determining the response rates (RR).</p>

      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">The present inventors have invented novel proteins of the invention that bind IGF-IR with advantageous properties, including, but not limited to: monovalent or multivalent binding modes (e.g., one or more than one domains that bind a particular target (including IGF-IR and other tyrosine kinase receptors); high selectivity for the desired target over other receptors, particularly with respect to proteins binding IGF-IR selectively over the insulin receptor; tunable affinity, including a range from about 100 nM to less than about 10 pM (including femtomolar affinity); specific antagonist activity while having minimal or undetectable agonist activity; blocking of IGF-I or IGF-II binding or activation; monospecific or multispecific binding to desired targets; single or multiple epitope binding; prolonged serum half life in rat; sub-cutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) dosing; small size (e.g. Ë5 kDa to Ë40 kDa); Tm's over about 55Â° C. or over about 60Â° C.; and substantially monomeric nature (e.g. single peak on size exclusion chromatography (SEC), such as about 90% of the area, about 95% of the area or about 98% of the area).</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="2">Making and Testing of Novel Proteins by the Trillions</heading>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">As one aspect of the invention, an estimated 1-5 trillion different protein variants were made, along with 1-5 trillion RNA and DNA variants corresponding to such proteins and encoding such proteins. The proteins that were made were tested for binding to human IGF-IR, and in some instances were further expressed and purified and subjected to a variety of biological, biochemical and biophysical assays and measurements to assist in identifying suitable useful proteins, particularly therapeutics.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0124">In addition, over 5000 protein variants were expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, using examples of vectors and polynucleotides of the invention, and tested for expression levels and a variety of biological, biochemical and biophysical assays. Depending on the results of these measurements different, selected proteins were advanced to make further optimized variations with characteristics described herein. Many such proteins were also tested for selectivity with respect the insulin receptor.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">The inventors were the first to apply this type of extensive assessment of protein and domain binding to IGF-IR. One way to rapidly make and test proteins of the invention for this type of assessment is the nucleic acid-protein fusion technology of Adnexus Therapeutics, Inc. This disclosure describes the use of such in vitro expression and tagging technology, termed PROfusionâ¢, that exploits nucleic acid-protein fusions (RNA- and DNA-protein fusions) to identify novel single and multiple domain polypeptides and amino acid motifs that are important for binding to IGF-IR and other protein including tyrosine kinase receptors. Nucleic acid-protein fusion technology is a technology that covalently couples a protein to its encoding genetic information. PROfusionâ¢ technology was used to screen collections of nucleic acids encoding single domain polypeptides constructed using a scaffold based on the human fibronectin type three domain (<sup>10</sup>Fn3) or constructed from the variable domains of antibody light chains. The expressed polypeptides, termed a âlibraryâ of scaffold proteins, were screened for polypeptides that could bind a target with high affinity. We isolated from this library of scaffold proteins novel single domain polypeptides that bind to IGF-IR and that inhibit IGF-IR biological activities. Furthermore, it was discovered that many independently randomized loops situated in immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin-like scaffolds tended to converge to a related set of consensus sequences that participated in IGF-IR binding. Therefore, it is expected that polypeptides having these consensus sequences will be useful as IGF-IR binding agents even when separated from the protein context in which they were identified. See, for example, examples and tables herein. Such polypeptides may be used as independent, small peptide IGF-IR binding agents or may be situated in other proteins, particularly proteins that share an immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin-like fold. (For a detailed description of the RNA-protein fusion technology and fibronectin-based scaffold protein library screening methods see Szostak et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,258,558; 6,261,804; 6,214,553; 6,281,344; 6,207,446; 6,518,018; PCT Publication Nos. WO00/34784; WO01/64942; WO02/032925; and Roberts and Szostak, Proc Natl. Acad.

      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0126">As discussed above, the present disclosure demonstrates that single domain polypeptides having certain desirable properties, such as high affinity binding to IGF-IR, antagonist effects with respect to one or more of ligands of such receptor and improved pharmacokinetics, can be used as effective anti-cancer agents. While it is expected that the effectiveness of such polypeptides as anti-cancer agents is related to the role of IGF ligand and receptors in cancer, we do not wish to be bound to any particular mechanism.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0127">To our knowledge, the present disclosure represents the first successful effort to use an Fn3-based polypeptide designed to achieve a therapeutic effect in vitro and in vivo for IGF-IR. Many of the improvements and discoveries made in achieving in vivo effectiveness will be broadly applicable to other Fn3-based polypeptides to this and other targets and other protein moieties and domains, generally proteins less than about 50 kDa or about 40 kDa. In other words, although ligand binding properties of an Fn3-based polypeptide will generally be determined by a relatively small number of amino acids situated in solvent accessible loop regions, other features, such as pharmacokinetic features, of Fn3-based polypeptides will tend to be determined by the majority of the protein that is not directly involved in ligand binding and that is conserved from protein to protein regardless of the target protein. This has been the case with antibodies, where a few loops, called CDR regions, mediate antigen binding, while other features of in vivo antibody behavior are largely dictated by the conserved framework regions and constant domains.</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="2">Additional Protein Embodiments</heading>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0128">Proteins of the invention include a single domain polypeptide described herein which is generally a polypeptide that binds to a target, such as IGF-IR, and where target binding activity situated within a single structural domain, as differentiated from, for example, antibodies and single chain antibodies, where antigen binding activity is generally contributed by both a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain. The disclosure also provides larger proteins that may comprise single domain polypeptides that bind to target. For example, a plurality of single domain polypeptides may be connected to create a composite molecule with increased avidity or multivalency. Likewise, a single domain polypeptide may be attached (e.g., as a fusion protein) to any number of other polypeptides. In certain aspects a single domain polypeptide may comprise at least five to seven beta or beta-like strands distributed among at least two beta sheets, as exemplified by immunoglobulin and immunoglobulin-like domains. A beta-like strand is a string of amino acids that participates in the stabilization of a single domain polypeptide but does not necessarily adopt a beta strand conformation. Whether a beta-like strand participates in the stabilization of the protein may be assessed by deleting the string or altering the sequence of the string and analyzing whether protein stability is diminished. Stability may be assessed by, for example, thermal denaturation and renaturation studies. Preferably, a single domain polypeptide will include no more than two beta-like strands. A beta-like strand will not usually adopt an alpha-helical conformation but may adopt a random coil structure. In the context of an immunoglobulin domain or an immunoglobulin-like domain, a beta-like strand will most often occur at the position in the structure that would otherwise be occupied by the most N-terminal beta strand or the most C-terminal beta strand. An amino acid string which, if situated in the interior of a protein sequence would normally form a beta strand, may, when situated at a position closer to an N- or C-terminus, adopt a conformation that is not clearly a beta strand and is referred to herein as a beta-like strand.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0129">In certain embodiments, the disclosure provides single domain polypeptides that bind to IGF-IR. Preferably the single domain polypeptides bind to human IGF-IR and a model species IGF-IR. A single domain polypeptide may comprise between about 80 and about 150 amino acids that have a structural organization comprising: at least seven beta strands or beta-like strands distributed between at least two beta sheets, and at least one loop portion connecting two beta strands or beta-like strands, which loop portion participates in binding to IGF-IR. In other words a loop portion may link two beta strands, two beta-like strands or one beta strand and one beta-like strand. Typically, one or more of the loop portions will participate in IGF-IR binding, although it is possible that one or more of the beta or beta-like strand portions will also participate in IGF-IR binding, particularly those beta or beta-like strand portions that are situated closest to the loop portions. A single domain polypeptide may comprise a structural unit that is an immunoglobulin domain or an immunoglobulin-like domain. A single domain polypeptide may bind to any part of IGF-IR, although polypeptides that bind to an extracellular domain of a IGF-IR are preferred. Binding may be assessed in terms of equilibrium constants (e.g., dissociation, K<sub>D</sub>) and in terms of kinetic constants (e.g., on rate constant, k<sub>on </sub>and off rate constant, k<sub>off</sub>). A single domain polypeptide will typically be selected to bind to IGF-IR with a K<sub>D </sub>of less than about 10<sup>â6</sup>M, or less than about 10<sup>â7</sup>M, about 5Ã10<sup>â8</sup>M, about 10<sup>â8</sup>M or less than about 10<sup>â9</sup>M. IGF-IR binding polypeptides may compete for binding with one, or two or more members of the IGF family, particularly IGF-I and IGF-II, and may inhibit one or more IGF-IR-mediated biological events, such as proliferation of cancer cells and cancer metastasis. IGF-IR binding polypeptides may be used for therapeutic purposes as well as for any purpose involving the detection or binding of IGF-IR. Polypeptides for therapeutic use will generally have a K<sub>D </sub>of less than 5Ã10<sup>â8</sup>M, less than 10<sup>â8</sup>M or less than 10<sup>â9</sup>M, although higher K<sub>D </sub>values may be tolerated where the k<sub>off </sub>is sufficiently low or the k<sub>on </sub>is sufficiently high. In certain embodiments, a single domain polypeptide that binds to IGF-IR will comprise a consensus or one or more sequences of the IGF-IR binding sequences selected from the IGF-IR binding clones described herein. Preferably, such sequence will be situated in a loop, particularly the BC, DE, and FG loops as described in PCT Publication No. WO2005/056764A2 by Chen et al.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0130">In certain embodiments, the single domain polypeptide comprises an immunoglobulin (Ig) variable domain. The Ig variable domain may, for example, be selected from the group consisting of: a human V<sub>L </sub>domain, a human V<sub>H </sub>domain and a camelid V<sub>HH </sub>domain. One, two, three or more loops of the Ig variable domain may participate in binding to IGF-IR, and typically any of the loops known as CDR1, CDR2 or CDR3 will participate in IGF-IR binding.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0131">In certain embodiments, the single domain polypeptide comprises an immunoglobulin-like domain. One, two, three or more loops of the immunoglobulin-like domain may participate in binding to IGF-IR. A preferred immunoglobulin-like domain is a fibronectin type III (Fn3) domain. Such domain may comprise, in order from N-terminus to C-terminus, a beta or beta-like strand, A; a loop, AB; a beta or beta-like strand, B; a loop, BC; a beta or beta-like strand C; a loop CD; a beta or beta-like strand D; a loop DE; a beta or beta-like strand, E; a loop, EF; a beta or beta-like strand F; a loop FG; and a beta or beta-like strand G. See <figref>FIG. 24</figref> for an example of the structural organization. Optionally, any or all of loops AB, BC, CD, DE, EF and FG may participate in IGF-IR binding, although preferred loops are BC, DE and FG and in particular loops BC and FG. A preferred Fn3 domain is an Fn3 domain derived from human fibronectin, particularly the 10<sup>th </sup>Fn3 domain of fibronectin, referred to as <sup>10</sup>Fn3. It should be noted that none of IGF-IR binding polypeptides disclosed herein have an amino acid sequence that is identical to native <sup>10</sup>Fn3; the sequence has been modified to obtain IGF-IR binding proteins, but proteins having the basic structural features of <sup>10</sup>Fn3, and particularly those retaining recognizable sequence homology to the native <sup>10</sup>Fn3 are nonetheless referred to herein as â<sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptidesâ. This nomenclature is similar to that found in the antibody field where, for example, a recombinant antibody V<sub>L </sub>domain generated against a particular target protein may not be identical to any naturally occurring V<sub>L </sub>domain but nonetheless the protein is recognizably a V<sub>L </sub>protein. A <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptide may be at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, or 90% identical to the human <sup>10</sup>Fn3 domain, shown in SEQ ID NO:1. Much of the variability will generally occur in one or more of the loops. Each of the beta or beta-like strands of a <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptide may consist essentially of an amino acid sequence that is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 100% identical to the sequence of a corresponding beta or beta-like strand of SEQ ID NO: 1, provided that such variation does not disrupt the stability of the polypeptide in physiological conditions. A <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptide may have a sequence in each of the loops AB, CD, and EF that consists essentially of an amino acid sequence that is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 100% identical to the sequence of a corresponding loop of SEQ ID NO:1. In many instances, any or all of loops BC, DE, and FG will be poorly conserved relative to SEQ ID NO:1. For example, all of loops BC, DE, and FG may be less than 20%, 10%, or 0% identical to their corresponding loops in SEQ ID NO:1. In some embodiments, only the BC and FG loops will be poorly conserved relative to SEQ ID NO:1.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0132">In certain embodiments, the disclosure provides polypeptides comprising a tenth fibronectin type III (<sup>10</sup>Fn3) domain, wherein the <sup>10</sup>Fn3 domain comprises a loop, AB; a loop, BC; a loop, CD; a loop, DE; a loop EF; and a loop FG; and has at least one loop selected from loop BC, DE, and FG with an altered amino acid sequence relative to the sequence of the corresponding loop of the human <sup>10</sup>Fn3 domain. By âIâ is meant one or more amino acid sequence alterations relative to a template sequence (corresponding human fibronectin domain) and includes amino acid additions, deletions, and substitutions. Altering an amino acid sequence may be accomplished through intentional, blind, or spontaneous sequence variation, generally of a nucleic acid coding sequence, and may occur by any technique, for example, PCR, error-prone PCR, or chemical DNA synthesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0133">In some embodiments, one or more loops selected from BC, DE, and FG may be extended or shortened in length relative to the corresponding human fibronectin loop. In some embodiments, the length of the loop may be extended by from 2-25 amino acids. In some embodiments, the length of the loop may be decreased by from 1-11 amino acids. In particular, the FG loop of <sup>10</sup>Fn3 is 12 residues long, whereas the corresponding loop in antibody heavy chains ranges from 4-28 residues. To optimize antigen binding, therefore, the length of the FG loop of <sup>10</sup>Fn3 is preferably randomized in length as well as in sequence to cover the CDR3 range of 4-28 residues to obtain the greatest possible flexibility and affinity in antigen binding. In some embodiments, the integrin-binding motif may be replaced by an amino acid sequence in which a polar amino acid-neutral amino acid-acidic amino acid sequence (in the N-terminal to C-terminal direction).</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0134">In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprising a <sup>10</sup>Fn3 domain comprises the amino acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 2-125 or 184-202. Additional sequences may be added to the N- or C-terminus. For example, an additional MG sequence may be placed at the N-terminus. The M will usually be cleaved off, leaving a GVS . . . sequence at the N-terminus. In some embodiments, linker sequences may be placed at the C-terminus of the <sup>10</sup>Fn3 domain, e.g., SEQ ID NOS: 203 and 226.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0135">In certain embodiments, the disclosure provides a non-antibody polypeptide comprising a domain having an immunoglobulin-like fold that binds to IGF-IR. The non-antibody polypeptide may have a molecular weight of less than 20 kDa, or less than 15 kDa and will generally be derived (by, for example, alteration of the amino acid sequence) from a reference, or âscaffoldâ, protein, such as an Fn3 scaffold. The non-antibody polypeptide may bind IGF-IR with a K<sub>D </sub>less than 10<sup>â6</sup>M, or less than 10<sup>â7</sup>M, less than 5Ã10<sup>â8</sup>M, less than 10<sup>â8</sup>M or less than 10<sup>â9</sup>M. The unaltered reference protein either will not meaningfully bind to IGF-IR or will bind with a K<sub>D </sub>of greater than 10<sup>â6</sup>M. The non-antibody polypeptide may inhibit IGF-IR signaling, particularly where the non-antibody polypeptide has a K<sub>D </sub>of less than 5Ã10<sup>â8</sup>M, less than 10<sup>â8</sup>M or less than 10<sup>â9</sup>M, although higher K<sub>D </sub>values may be tolerated where the k<sub>off </sub>is sufficiently low (e.g., less than 5Ã10â4 s<sup>â1</sup>). The immunoglobulin-like fold may be a <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0136">In certain embodiments, the disclosure provides a polypeptide comprising a single domain having an immunoglobulin fold that binds to IGF-IR. The polypeptide may have a molecular weight of less than 20 kDa, or less than 15 kDa and will generally be derived (by, for example, alteration of the amino acid sequence) from a variable domain of an immunoglobulin. The polypeptide may bind IGF-IR with a K<sub>D </sub>less than 10<sup>â6</sup>M, or less than 10<sup>â7</sup>M, less than 5Ã10<sup>â8</sup>M, less than 10<sup>â8</sup>M or less than 10<sup>â9</sup>M. The polypeptide may inhibit IGF-IR signaling, particularly where the polypeptide has a K<sub>D </sub>of less than 5Ã10<sup>â8</sup>M, less than 10<sup>â8</sup>M or less than 10<sup>â9</sup>M, although higher K<sub>D </sub>values may be tolerated where the k<sub>off </sub>is sufficiently low or where the k<sub>on </sub>is sufficiently high. In certain preferred embodiments, a single domain polypeptide having an immunoglobulin fold derived from an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain and capable of binding to IGF-IR may comprise an amino acid sequence selected from the IGF-IR binding clones described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0137">In certain preferred embodiments, the disclosure provides IGF-IR binding polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of any of the IGF-IR binding clones described herein with the most desirable biochemical features. In the case of a polypeptide comprising such amino acid sequences, a PEG moiety or other moiety of interest may be covalently bound to the cysteine at position from about 85 to 100 depending on the protein. The PEG moiety may also be covalently bonded to an amine moiety in the polypeptide. The amine moiety may be, for example, a primary amine found at the N-terminus of a polypeptide or an amine group present in an amino acid, such as lysine or arginine. In certain embodiments, the PEG moiety is attached at a position on the polypeptide selected from the group consisting of: a) the N-terminus; b) between the N-terminus and the most N-terminal beta strand or beta-like strand; c) a loop positioned on a face of the polypeptide opposite the target-binding site; d) between the C-terminus and the most C-terminal beta strand or beta-like strand; and e) at the C-terminus.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0138">In certain aspects, the disclosure provides short peptide sequences that mediate IGF-IR binding. Such sequences may mediate IGF-IR binding in an isolated form or when inserted into a particular protein structure, such as an immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin-like domain. Examples of such sequences include those disclosed as in the tables and other sequences that are at least 85%, 90%, or 95% identical to SEQ ID 1 or any other sequence listed herein and retain IGF-IR binding activity. Accordingly, the disclosure provides substantially pure or isolated polypeptides comprising an amino acid sequence that is at least 85% identical to the sequence of any of such sequences, wherein said polypeptide binds to a IGF-IR and competes with an IGF species for binding to IGF-IR. Examples of such polypeptides include a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence that is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 100% identical to an amino acid sequence at least 85% identical to the sequence of any in the tables. Preferably such polypeptides will inhibit a biological activity of an IGF and may bind to IGF-IR with a K<sub>D </sub>less than 10<sup>â6</sup>M, or less than 10<sup>â7</sup>M, less than 5Ã10<sup>â8</sup>M, less than 10<sup>â8</sup>M or less than 10<sup>â9</sup>M.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0139">In certain embodiments, any of the IGF-IR binding polypeptides described herein may be bound to one or more additional moieties, including, for example, a moiety that also binds to IGF-IR (e.g., a second identical or different IGF-IR binding polypeptide), a moiety that binds to a different target (e.g., to create a dual-specificity binding agent), a labeling moiety, a moiety that facilitates protein purification or a moiety that provides improved pharmacokinetics. Improved pharmacokinetics may be assessed according to the perceived therapeutic need. Often it is desirable to increase bioavailability and/or increase the time between doses, possibly by increasing the time that a protein remains available in the serum after dosing. In some instances, it is desirable to improve the continuity of the serum concentration of the protein over time (e.g., decrease the difference in serum concentration of the protein shortly after administration and shortly before the next administration). Moieties that tend to slow clearance of a protein from the blood, herein referred to as âPK moietiesâ, include polyoxyalkylene moieties, e.g., polyethylene glycol, sugars (e.g., sialic acid), and well-tolerated protein moieties (e.g., Fc, Fc fragments or serum albumin). The polypeptides of the invention may be fused to albumin or a fragment (portion) or variant of albumin as described in U.S. Publication No. 20070048282. The single domain polypeptide may be attached to a moiety that reduces the clearance rate of the polypeptide in a mammal (e.g., mouse, rat, or human) by greater than three-fold relative to the unmodified polypeptide. Other measures of improved pharmacokinetics may include serum half-life, which is often divided into an alpha phase and a beta phase. Either or both phases may be improved significantly by addition of an appropriate moiety. Where polyethylene glycol is employed, one or more PEG molecules may be attached at different positions in the protein, and such attachment may be achieved by reaction with amines, thiols or other suitable reactive groups. Pegylation may be achieved by site-directed pegylation, wherein a suitable reactive group is introduced into the protein to create a site where pegylation preferentially occurs. In a preferred embodiment, the protein is modified so as to have a cysteine residue at a desired position, permitting site directed pegylation on the cysteine. PEG may vary widely in molecular weight and may be branched or linear. Notably, the present disclosure establishes that pegylation is compatible with target binding activity of <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptides and, further, that pegylation improves the pharmacokinetics of such polypeptides. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the disclosure provides pegylated forms of <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptides, regardless of the target that can be bound by such polypeptides.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0140">In some embodiments, the polypeptide of the invention comprises a conjugate of a fibronectin-based scaffold protein and a PK moiety.

The PK moiety may be any moiety that improves the pharmocokinetics of the fibronectin-based scaffold protein. In some embodiments, the PK moiety at least doubles the serum half-life of the scaffold protein. In some embodiments, the PK moiety is linked to the scaffold protein via a polypeptide linker. Exemplary polypeptide linkers include PSTSTST (SEQ ID NO: 244), EIDKPSQ (SEQ ID NO: 245), and GS linkers, such as GSGSGSGSGS (SEQ ID NO: 246) and multimers thereof. In some embodiments the PK moiety is human serum albumin. In some embodiments, the PK moiety is transferrin.</p>

Detection may be carried out using any technique known in the art, such as, for example, radiography, immunological assay, fluorescence detection, mass spectroscopy, or surface plasmon resonance. The sample will often by a biological sample, such as a biopsy, and particularly a biopsy of a tumor, a suspected tumor. The sample may be from a human or other mammal. The IGF-IR binding polypeptide may be labeled with a labeling moiety, such as a radioactive moiety, a fluorescent moiety, a chromogenic moiety, a chemiluminescent moiety, or a hapten moiety. The IGF-IR binding polypeptide may be immobilized on a solid support.</p>

      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0146">In certain aspects, the disclosure provides discoveries that may be applicable to any <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptide, regardless of which target the polypeptide is engineered to bind. As noted above, the disclosure demonstrates that PEG can be used successfully to improve the pharmacokinetics of a <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptide, while not interfering meaningfully with target binding. Accordingly, the disclosure provides pegylated <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptides that bind to target and have improved pharmacokinetics relative to the non-pegylated polypeptide. In a further embodiment, the disclosure demonstrates that a deletion of the first eight amino acids of a <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptide can increase target binding affinity. Accordingly, the disclosure provides <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptides lacking the initial eight amino acids (amino acids numbered in reference to the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1). It is understood that one or two amino acids may be added back to the deleted form of the polypeptide so as to facilitate translation and proper processing. The disclosure demonstrates that subcutaneous administration of a <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptide results in a delayed release of polypeptide into the bloodstream and a decreased maximum serum concentration of the <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptide. Accordingly, the disclosure provides methods for administering a <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptide to a patient by a subcutaneous administration. This route of administration may be useful to achieve a delayed release relative to intravenous administration, and/or to decrease the maximum serum concentration of the <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptide by at least 25% or at least 50% relative to the maximum serum concentration achieved by intravenous administration of an equal dosage. The administered <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptide may be attached to a moiety that increases the serum half-life (or decreases clearance rate, or similarly affects another pharmacokinetic parameter) of the <sup>10</sup>Fn3 polypeptide, such as a polyethylene glycol moiety.

Such single domain polypeptides are particularly useful where the first mammal is a human and the second mammal is a desirable mammal in which to conduct preclinical testing, such as a mouse, rat, guinea pig, dog, or non-human primate. The disclosure demonstrates that single domain polypeptides can be engineered to have such dual specificity, and that the dual specificity simplifies drug development by allowing testing of the same polypeptide in human cells, human subjects and animal models. Preferably, the preselected target protein of the first mammal and the homolog thereof from the second mammal are sufficiently similar in amino acid sequence to allow generation of dual specificity polypeptides. For example, the preselected target protein and the homolog from the second mammal may share at least 80%, 90%, or 95% identity across a region of at least 50 amino acids, and optionally may share at least 80%, 90%, or 95% identity across the entire protein sequence or across the sequence of the extracellular domain, in the case of a membrane protein. A single domain polypeptide with this type of dual specificity binding characteristic may comprise an immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin-like domain, and will preferably bind to both the preselected human target protein and to the homolog thereof with a dissociation constant of less than 1Ã10<sup>â6</sup>M, 1Ã10<sup>â7</sup>M, 5Ã10<sup>â8</sup>M, 1Ã10<sup>â8</sup>M or 1Ã10<sup>â9</sup>M.</p>

When such proteins are expressed in microbes it may be preferable to isolate domains and then link them via PEG or other polymeric linker. PEG, or other functionally operably polymeric linkers, can be used to optimally vary the distance between each protein moiety to create a protein with one or more of the following characteristics: 1) reduced or increased steric hindrance of binding of one or more protein domain when binding to a protein of interest (e.g., a target), 2) connect two or more domains that bind different targets, 3) increase protein stability or solubility without searching for additional amino acid substitutions to increase stability or solubility (e.g., solubility at least about 20 mg/ml, or at least about 50 mg/ml), 4) decrease protein aggregation without searching for additional amino acid substitutions to decrease stability (e.g., as measured by SEC), 4) increase the overall avidity or affinity of the protein for the protein of interest by adding additional binding domains.

The term âPEGâ is used broadly to encompass any polyethylene glycol molecule, without regard to size or to modification at an end of the PEG, and can be represented by the formula:</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0000">XâO(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n-1</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH (1), where n is 20 to 2300 and X is H or a terminal modification, e.g., a C<sub>1-4 </sub>alkyl. In one embodiment, the PEG of the invention terminates on one end with hydroxy or methoxy, i.e., X is H or CH<sub>3 </sub>(âmethoxy PEGâ). A PEG can contain further chemical groups which are necessary for binding reactions; which results from the chemical synthesis of the molecule; or which is a spacer for optimal distance of parts of the molecule. In addition, such a PEG can consist of one or more PEG side-chains which are linked together. PEGs with more than one PEG chain are called multiarmed or branched PEGs. Branched PEGs can be prepared, for example, by the addition of polyethylene oxide to various polyols, including glycerol, pentaerythriol, and sorbitol. For example, a four-armed branched PEG can be prepared from pentaerythriol and ethylene oxide. Branched PEG are described in, for example, European Published Application No. 473084A and U.S. Pat. No. 5,932,462. One form of PEGs includes two PEG side-chains (PEG2) linked via the primary amino groups of a lysine (Monfardini, C., et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 6 (1995) 62-69).</p>

      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0166">PEG conjugation to peptides or proteins generally involves the activation of PEG and coupling of the activated PEG-intermediates directly to target proteins/peptides or to a linker, which is subsequently activated and coupled to target proteins/peptides (see Abuchowski, A. et al, <i>J. Biol. Chem</i>., 252, 3571 (1977) and <i>J. Biol. Chem</i>., 252, 3582 (1977), Zalipsky, et al., and Harris et. al., in: Poly(ethylene glycol) Chemistry: Biotechnical and Biomedical Applications; (J. M. Harris ed.) Plenum Press: New York, 1992; Chap. 21 and 22). It is noted that a binding polypeptide containing a PEG molecule is also known as a conjugated protein, whereas the protein lacking an attached PEG molecule can be referred to as unconjugated.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0167">A variety of molecular mass forms of PEG can be selected, e.g., from about 1,000 Daltons (Da) to 100,000 Da (n is 20 to 2300), for conjugating to binding polypeptides of the invention. The number of repeating units ânâ in the PEG is approximated for the molecular mass described in Daltons. It is preferred that the combined molecular mass of PEG on an activated linker is suitable for pharmaceutical use. Thus, in one embodiment, the molecular mass of the PEG molecules does not exceed 100,000 Da. For example, if three PEG molecules are attached to a linker, where each PEG molecule has the same molecular mass of 12,000 Da (each n is about 270), then the total molecular mass of PEG on the linker is about 36,000 Da (total n is about 820). The molecular masses of the PEG attached to the linker can also be different, e.g., of three molecules on a linker two PEG molecules can be 5,000 Da each (each n is about 110) and one PEG molecule can be 12,000 Da (n is about 270).</p>

Mutations may be introduced into an binding polypeptide coding sequence to generate cysteine residues. This might be achieved, for example, by mutating one or more amino acid residues to cysteine. Preferred amino acids for mutating to a cysteine residue include serine, threonine, alanine and other hydrophilic residues. Preferably, the residue to be mutated to cysteine is a surface-exposed residue. Algorithms are well-known in the art for predicting surface accessibility of residues based on primary sequence or a protein. Alternatively, surface residues may be predicted by comparing the amino acid sequences of binding polypeptides, given that the crystal structure of the framework based on which binding polypeptides are designed and evolved has been solved (see Himanen et al., Nature.

The steps of the method involve forming the recombinant polypeptide and protecting it with one or more biologically added protecting groups at the N-terminal alpha-amine and C-terminal alpha-carboxyl. The polypeptide can then be reacted with chemical protecting agents to selectively protect reactive side chain groups and thereby prevent side chain groups from being modified. The polypeptide is then cleaved with a cleavage reagent specific for the biological protecting group to form an unprotected terminal amino acid alpha-carbon reactive group. The unprotected terminal amino acid alpha-carbon reactive group is modified with a chemical modifying agent. The side chain protected terminally modified single copy polypeptide is then deprotected at the side chain groups to form a terminally modified recombinant single copy polypeptide. The number and sequence of steps in the method can be varied to achieve selective modification at the N- and/or C-terminal amino acid of the polypeptide.</p>

In another embodiment, the pH is in a slightly basic range, e.g., from about 7.5 to 8.5. Buffers having a pKa close to neutral pH range may be used, e.g., phosphate buffer. Other ratios will be used when making multi-specific PEG linked proteins, such as about 1:4 to 1:8, or about 1:3 to 1:5 Conventional separation and purification techniques known in the art can be used to purify PEGylated binding polypeptide, such as size exclusion (e.g., gel filtration) and ion exchange chromatography. Products may also be separated using SDS-PAGE. Products that may be separated include mono-, di-, tri- poly- and un-pegylated binding polypeptide, as well as free PEG. The percentage of mono-PEG conjugates can be controlled by pooling broader fractions around the elution peak to increase the percentage of mono-PEG in the composition. About ninety percent mono-PEG conjugates represents a good balance of yield and activity. Compositions in which, for example, at least ninety-two percent or at least ninety-six percent of the conjugates are mono-PEG species may be desired. In an embodiment of this invention the percentage of mono-PEG conjugates is from ninety percent to ninety-six percent.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0181">In one embodiment, PEGylated binding polypeptide of the invention contain one, two or more PEG moieties. In one embodiment, the PEG moiety(ies) are bound to an amino acid residue which is on the surface of the protein and/or away from the surface that contacts the target ligand. In one embodiment, the combined or total molecular mass of PEG in PEG-binding polypeptide is from about 3,000 Da to 60,000 Da, optionally from about 10,000 Da to 36,000 Da. In a one embodiment, the PEG in pegylated binding polypeptide is a substantially linear, straight-chain PEG.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0182">In one embodiment of the invention, the PEG in pegylated binding polypeptide is not hydrolyzed from the pegylated amino acid residue using a hydroxylamine assay, e.g., 450 mM hydroxylamine (pH 6.5) over 8 to 16 hours at room temperature, and is thus stable. In one embodiment, greater than 80% of the composition is stable mono-PEG-binding polypeptide, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0183">In another embodiment, the pegylated binding polypeptides of the invention will preferably retain at least about 25%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 100% of the biological activity associated with the unmodified protein. In one embodiment, biological activity refers to its ability to bind to VEGFR-2 or IGF-IR, as assessed by K<sub>D</sub>, k<sub>on </sub>or k<sub>off</sub>. In one specific embodiment, the pegylated binding polypeptide protein shows an increase in binding to VEGFR or IGF-IR relative to unpegylated binding polypeptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0184">The serum clearance rate of PEG-modified polypeptide may be decreased by about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or even 90%, relative to the clearance rate of the unmodified binding polypeptide. The PEG-modified polypeptide may have a half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) which is enhanced relative to the half-life of the unmodified protein. The half-life of PEG-binding polypeptide may be enhanced by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 400% or 500%, or even by 1000% relative to the half-life of the unmodified binding polypeptide. In some embodiments, the protein half-life is determined in vitro, such as in a buffered saline solution or in serum. In other embodiments, the protein half-life is an in vivo half life, such as the half-life of the protein in the serum or other bodily fluid of an animal.</p>

      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0185">Nucleic acids encoding any of the various proteins or polypeptides disclosed herein may be synthesized chemically. Codon usage may be selected so as to improve expression in a cell. Such codon usage will depend on the cell type selected. Specialized codon usage patterns have been developed for <i>E. coli </i>and other bacteria, as well as mammalian cells, plant cells, yeast cells and insect cells. See for example: Mayfield et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U.S.A. 2003 Jan. 21; 100(2):438-42; Sinclair et al. Protein Expr Purif. 2002 October; 26(1):96-105; Connell N D.

      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0186">General techniques for nucleic acid manipulation are described for example in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2 ed., 1989, or F. Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Green Publishing and Wiley-Interscience: New York, 1987) and periodic updates, herein incorporated by reference. The DNA encoding the polypeptide is operably linked to suitable transcriptional or translational regulatory elements derived from mammalian, viral, or insect genes. Such regulatory elements include a transcriptional promoter, an optional operator sequence to control transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosomal binding sites, and sequences that control the termination of transcription and translation. The ability to replicate in a host, usually conferred by an origin of replication, and a selection gene to facilitate recognition of transformants are additionally incorporated.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0187">The proteins of this invention may be produced recombinantly not only directly, but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide, which is preferably a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process a native signal sequence, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, lpp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the native signal sequence may be substituted by, e.g., the yeast invertase leader, a factor leader (including <i>Saccharomyces </i>and <i>Kluyveromyces</i>.alpha.-factor leaders), or acid phosphatase leader, the <i>C. albicans </i>glucoamylase leader, or the signal described in PCT Publication No. WO90/13646. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available. The DNA for such precursor regions may be ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0188">Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally, in cloning vectors this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA, and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2.mu. plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors (the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter).</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0189">Expression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for Bacilli.</p>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0190">One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0191">Another example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian or eukaryotic cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the multivalent antibody nucleic acid, such as DHFR, thymidine kinase, metallothionein-I and âII, preferably primate metallothionein genes, adenosine deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0192">For example, cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in DHFR activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0193">Alternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR) transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding multivalent antibody, wild-type DHFR protein, and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3â²-phosphotransferase (APH) can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin, neomycin, or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,199.</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0194">A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trpl gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 (Stinchcomb et al., Nature, 282:39 (1979)). The trpl gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example, ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4-1. Jones, Genetics, 85:12 (1977). The presence of the trpl lesion in the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan. Similarly, Leu2-deficient yeast strains (ATCC 20,622 or 38,626) are complemented by known plasmids bearing the Leu2 gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0195">In addition, vectors derived from the 1.6.mu.m circular plasmid pKD1 can be used for transformation of <i>Kluyveromyces </i>yeasts. Alternatively, an expression system for large-scale production of recombinant calf chymosin was reported for <i>K. lactis</i>. Van den Berg, Bio/Technology, 8:135 (1990). Stable multi-copy expression vectors for secretion of mature recombinant human serum albumin by industrial strains of <i>Kluyveromyces </i>have also been disclosed. Fleer et al., Bio/Technology, 9:968-975 (1991).</p>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0196">Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the protein of the invention, e.g., a fibronectin-based scaffold protein. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the phoA promoter, beta-lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system, and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter. However, other known bacterial promoters are suitable. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding the protein of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0197">Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3â² end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3â² end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.</p>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0198">Examples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase.</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0199">Other yeast promoters, which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, metallothionein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP Patent Publication No. 73,657. Yeast enhancers also are advantageously used with yeast promoters.</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0200">Transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells can be controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and most preferably Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0201">The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,601,978. See also Reyes et al., Nature 297:598-601 (1982) on expression of human .beta.-interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively, the rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.</p>
      <p id="p-00203-en" num="0202">Transcription of a DNA encoding proteins of the invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, .alpha.-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv, Nature 297:17-18 (1982) on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5â² or 3â² to the multivalent antibody-encoding sequence, but is preferably located at a site 5â² from the promoter.</p>
      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0203">Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (e.g., yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5â² and, occasionally 3â², untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding the multivalent antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94/11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00205-en" num="0204">The recombinant DNA can also include any type of protein tag sequence that may be useful for purifying the protein. Examples of protein tags include but are not limited to a histidine tag, a FLAG tag, a myc tag, an HA tag, or a GST tag. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mammalian cellular hosts can be found in Cloning Vectors: A Laboratory Manual, (Elsevier, New York, 1985), the relevant disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00206-en" num="0205">The expression construct is introduced into the host cell using a method appropriate to the host cell, as will be apparent to one of skill in the art. A variety of methods for introducing nucleic acids into host cells are known in the art, including, but not limited to, electroporation; transfection employing calcium chloride, rubidium chloride, calcium phosphate, DEAE-dextran, or other substances; microprojectile bombardment; lipofection; and infection (where the vector is an infectious agent).</p>
      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0206">Suitable host cells include prokaryotes, yeast, mammalian cells, or bacterial cells. Suitable bacteria include gram negative or gram positive organisms, for example, <i>E. coli </i>or <i>Bacillus </i>spp. Yeast, preferably from the <i>Saccharomyces </i>species, such as <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, may also be used for production of polypeptides. Various mammalian or insect cell culture systems can also be employed to express recombinant proteins. Baculovirus systems for production of heterologous proteins in insect cells are reviewed by Luckow and Summers, (Bio/Technology, 6:47, 1988). Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include endothelial cells, COS-7 monkey kidney cells, CV-1, L cells, C127, 3T3, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), human embryonic kidney cells, HeLa, 293, 293T, and BHK cell lines. Purified polypeptides are prepared by culturing suitable host/vector systems to express the recombinant proteins. For many applications, the small size of many of the polypeptides disclosed herein would make expression in <i>E. coli </i>as the preferred method for expression. The protein is then purified from culture media or cell extracts.</p>

      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0209">Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated proteins of the invention are derived from multicellular organisms.

Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCINâ¢ drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0213">Proteins disclosed herein can also be produced using cell-translation systems. For such purposes the nucleic acids encoding the polypeptide must be modified to allow in vitro transcription to produce mRNA and to allow cell-free translation of the mRNA in the particular cell-free system being utilized (eukaryotic such as a mammalian or yeast cell-free translation system or prokaryotic such as a bacterial cell-free translation system.</p>

      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0217">In some embodiments it may be preferable to glycosylate proteins of the invention. Preferably, such proteins are fibronectin based scaffolds. Fibronectin based scaffolds do not normally contain glycosylation sites, however, such glycosylation may be engineered into the protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0218">Glycosylation of proteins is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. These can be engineered into the proteins of the invention, in particular fibronectin-based scaffold proteins and their corresponding polynucleotides. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0219">Addition of glycosylation sites to the proteins of the invention are conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0220">Nucleic acid molecules encoding such amino acid sequence variants of the proteins of the invention are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the protein (e.g., fibronectin-based scaffold protein).</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0221">It may be desirable to modify proteins of the invention with respect to effector function, e.g., so as to enhance antigen-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing an active portion of an Fc region, as well as one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of the protein (e.g., fibronectin-based scaffold protein), thereby generating a variant Fc region. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (e.g., a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions.</p>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0222">In one embodiment, the variant Fc region may mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the presence of human effector cells more effectively, or bind an Fc gamma receptor (FcÎ³R) with better affinity, than a native sequence Fc region. Such Fc region variants may comprise an amino acid modification at any one or more of positions 256, 290, 298, 312, 326, 330, 333, 334, 360, 378 or 430 of the Fc region, wherein the numbering of the residues in the Fc region is that of the EU index as in Kabat.</p>
      <heading id="h-00024-en" level="2">Additional Antibody Based Proteins, Including Moieties and Derivatives</heading>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0223">Additional embodiments of the invention, include single domain antibodies are antibodies whose complementary determining regions are part of a single domain polypeptide. Preferably, directed to IGF-IR, as well as included in the PEG linked proteins of invention. Examples include, but are not limited to, heavy chain antibodies, antibodies naturally devoid of light chains, single domain antibodies derived from conventional 4-chain antibodies, engineered antibodies and single domain scaffolds other than those derived from antibodies. Single domain antibodies may be any of the art, or any future single domain antibodies. Single domain antibodies may be derived from any species including, but not limited to mouse, human, camel, llama, goat, rabbit, bovine. According to one aspect of the invention, a single domain antibodies as used herein is a naturally occurring single domain antibody known as heavy chain antibody devoid of light chains. Such single domain antibodies are disclosed in WO94/04678 for example. For clarity reasons, this variable domain derived from a heavy chain antibody naturally devoid of light chain is known herein as a VHH or nanobody to distinguish it from the conventional VH of four chain immunoglobulins. Such a VHH molecule can be derived from antibodies raised in <i>Camelidae </i>species, for example in camel, dromedary, llama, vicuna, alpaca and guanaco. Other species besides <i>Camelidae </i>may produce heavy chain antibodies naturally devoid of light chain; such VHHs are within the scope of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0224">VHHs, according to the present invention, and as known to the skilled in the art are heavy chain variable domains derived from immunoglobulins naturally devoid of light chains such as those derived from <i>Camelidae </i>as described in WO94/04678 (and referred to hereinafter as VHH domains or nanobodies). VHH molecules are about 10.times. smaller than IgG molecules. They are single polypeptides and very stable, resisting extreme pH and temperature conditions. Moreover, they are resistant to the action of proteases which is not the case for conventional antibodies. Furthermore, in vitro expression of VHHs produces high yield, properly folded functional VHHs. In addition, antibodies generated in Camelids will recognize epitopes other than those recognized by antibodies generated in vitro through the use of antibody libraries or via immunization of mammals other than Camelids (WO9749805). As such, anti EGFR VHH's may interact more efficiently with EGFR than conventional antibodies, thereby blocking its interaction with the EGFR ligand(s) more efficiently. Since VHH's are known to bind into âunusualâ epitopes such as cavities or grooves (WO97/49805), the affinity of such VHH's may be more suitable for therapeutic treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0225">Another embodiment of the present invention is an anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor consisting of a sequence corresponding to that of a Camelidae VHH directed towards EGFR or a closely related family member. The invention also relates to a homologous sequence, a function portion or a functional portion of a homologous sequence of said polypeptide. The invention also relates to nucleic acids capable of encoding said polypeptides. A single domain antibody of the present invention may be directed against EGFR or a closely related family member.</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0226">According to the invention, as and discussed herein, a polypeptide construct may further comprise single domain antibodies directed against other targets such as, for example, serum albumin. A single domain antibody directed against a target means a single domain antibody that is capable of binding to said target with an affinity of better than 10<sup>â6</sup>M.</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0227">The present invention further relates to single domain antibodies is a VHH belonging to a class having human-like sequences. One such class is characterized in that the VHHs carry an amino acid from the group consisting of glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, methionine, serine, threonine, asparagine, or glutamine at position 45, such as, for example, L45 and a tryptophan at position 103, according to the Kabat numbering. As such, polypeptides belonging to this class show a high amino acid sequence homology to human VH framework regions and said polypeptides might be administered to a human directly without expectation of an unwanted immune response therefrom, and without the burden of further humanization.</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0228">Another human-like class of Camelidae single domain antibodies has been described in PCT Publication No. WO03/035694 and contain the hydrophobic FR2 residues typically found in conventional antibodies of human origin or from other species, but compensating this loss in hydrophilicity by the charged arginine residue on position 103 that substitutes the conserved tryptophan residue present in VH from double-chain antibodies. As such, peptides belonging to these two classes show a high amino acid sequence homology to human VH framework regions and said peptides might be administered to a human directly without expectation of an unwanted immune response therefrom, and without the burden of further humanization. The invention also relates to nucleic acids capable of encoding said polypeptides. Polypeptides may include the full length Camelidae antibodies, namely Fc and VHH domains.</p>
      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0229">Anti-albumin VHH's may interact in a more efficient way with serum albumin which is known to be a carrier protein. As a carrier protein some of the epitopes of serum albumin may be inaccessible by bound proteins, peptides and small chemical compounds. Since VHH's are known to bind into âunusualâ or non-conventional epitopes such as cavities (WO97/49805), the affinity of such VHH's to circulating albumin may be more suitable for therapeutic treatment. The serum protein may be any suitable protein found in the serum of subject, or fragment thereof. In one aspect of the invention, the serum protein is serum albumin, serum immunoglobulins, thyroxine-binding protein, transferrin, or fibrinogen. Depending on the intended use such as the required half-life for effective treatment and/or compartmentalization of the target antigen, the VHH-partner can be directed to one of the above serum proteins.</p>
      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0230">âAntibody fragmentsâ comprise only a portion of an intact antibody, generally including an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retaining the ability to bind antigen. Examples of antibody fragments encompassed by the present definition include: (i) the Fab fragment, having VL, CL, VH and CH1 domains; (ii) the Fabâ² fragment, which is a Fab fragment having one or more cysteine residues at the C-terminus of the CH1 domain; (iii) the Fd fragment having VH and CH1 domains; (iv) the Fdâ² fragment having VH and CH1 domains and one or more cysteine residues at the C-terminus of the CH1 domain; (v) the Fv fragment having the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody; (vi) the dAb fragment (Ward et al., Nature 341, 544-546 (1989)) which consists of a VH domain; (vii) isolated CDR regions; (viii) F(abâ²).sub.2 fragments, a bivalent fragment including two Fabâ² fragments linked by a disulphide bridge at the hinge region; (ix) single chain antibody molecules (e.g., single chain Fv; scFv) (Bird et al., Science 242:423-426 (1988); and Huston et al., PNAS (USA) 85:5879-5883 (1988)); (x) âdiabodiesâ with two antigen binding sites, comprising a heavy chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (see, e.g., EP Patent Publication No. 404,097; WO93/11161; and Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993)); (xi) âlinear antibodiesâ comprising a pair of tandem Fd segments (VH-CH1-VH-CH1) which, together with complementary light chain polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions (Zapata et al. Protein Eng. 8(10):1057-1062 (1995); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870).</p>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0231">Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments that may be used to make antibody fragments used in the invention. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al. , Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24:107-117 (1992); and Brennan et al., Science, 229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. For example, the antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fabâ²-SH fragments can be directly recovered from <i>E. coli </i>and chemically coupled to form F(abâ²).sub.2 fragments (Carter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(abâ²).sub.2 fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). See WO 93/16185; U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,894; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,458. The antibody fragment may also be a âlinear antibodyâ, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.</p>

Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).</p>
      <p id="p-00263-en" num="0261">The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.</p>
      <p id="p-00264-en" num="0262">Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the proteins of the invention, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsule. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and y ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOTâ¢ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(â)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated proteins of the invention may remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37C, resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular SâS bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00265-en" num="0263">While the skilled artisan will understand that the dosage of each therapeutic agent will be dependent on the identity of the agent, the preferred dosages can range from about 10 mg/square meter to about 2000 mg/square meter, more preferably from about 50 mg/square meter to about 1000 mg/square meter. For preferred agents such as platinum agents (carboplatin, oxaliplatin, cisplatin), the preferred dosage is about 10 mg/square meter to about 400 mg/square meter, for taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel) the preferred dosage is about 20 mg/square meter to about 150 mg/square meter, for gemcitabine the preferred dosage is about 100 mg/square meter to about 2000 mg/square meter, and for camptothecin the preferred dosage is about 50 mg/square meter to about 350 mg/square meter. The dosage of this and other therapeutic agents may depend on whether the antibody, antibody fragment or conjugate of the invention is administered concurrently or sequentially with a therapeutic agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00266-en" num="0264">For therapeutic applications, the proteins or conjugates of the invention are administered to a subject, in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form. They can be administered intravenously as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by intramuscular, subcutaneous, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrathecal, oral, topical, or inhalation routes. The protein may also be administered by intratumoral, peritumoral, intralesional, or perilesional routes, to exert local as well as systemic therapeutic effects. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, and excipients are well known and can be determined by those of skill in the art as the clinical situation warrants. Examples of suitable carriers, diluents and/or excipients include: (1) Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline, pH about 7.4, containing about 1 mg/ml to 25 mg/ml human serum albumin, (2) 0.9% saline (0.9% w/v NaCl), and (3) 5% (w/v) dextrose. The method of the present invention can be practiced in vitro, in vivo, or ex vivo.</p>
      <p id="p-00267-en" num="0265">Administration of a protein of the invention, and one or more additional therapeutic agents, whether co-administered or administered sequentially, may occur as described above for therapeutic applications. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, and excipients for co-administration will be understood by the skilled artisan to depend on the identity of the particular therapeutic agent being co-administered.</p>
      <p id="p-00268-en" num="0266">When present in an aqueous dosage form, rather than being lyophilized, the protein typically will be formulated at a concentration of about 0.1 mg/ml to 100 mg/ml, although wide variation outside of these ranges is permitted. For the treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of antibody or conjugate will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibodies are administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, the course of previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The protein is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments.</p>
      <p id="p-00269-en" num="0267">Depending on the type and severity of the disease, preferably from about 1 mg/square meter to about 2000 mg/square meter of protein is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, more preferably from about 10 mg/square meter to about 1000 mg/square meter of antibody whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is repeated until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. However, other dosage regimens may be useful and are not excluded.</p>
      <p id="p-00270-en" num="0268">The present invention also includes kits comprising one or more of the elements described herein, and instructions for the use of those elements. In a preferred embodiment, a kit of the present invention includes antibody, antibody fragment or conjugate of the invention, and a therapeutic agent. The instructions for this preferred embodiment include instructions for inhibiting the growth of a cancer cell using the protein of the invention, and the therapeutic agent, and/or instructions for a method of treating a patient having a cancer using the antibody, antibody fragment or conjugate of the invention, and the therapeutic agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00271-en" num="0269">Preferably, the therapeutic agent used in the kit is selected from the group consisting of docetaxel, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab, capecitabine, tamoxifen, toremifene, letrozole, anastrozole, fulvestrant, exemestane, goserelin, oxaliplatin, carboplatin, cisplatin, dexamethasone, antide, bevacizumab, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, levamisole, irinotecan, etoposide, topotecan, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, estramustine, mitoxantrone, abarelix, zoledronate, streptozocin, rituximab, idarubicin, busulfan, chlorambucil, fludarabine, imatinib, cytarabine, ibritumomab, tositumomab, interferon alpha-2b, melphalam, bortezomib, altretamine, asparaginase, gefitinib, erlonitib, anti-EGF receptor antibody (e.g., cetuximab or panitumumab), ixabepilone, and an epothilone or derivative thereof.

      <heading id="h-00034-en" level="1">Initial Identification of IGF-IR Binding Molecules</heading>
      <p id="p-00278-en" num="0276">A library of approximately 10<sup>13 </sup>RNA-protein fusion variants was constructed based on the scaffold of the tenth type 3 domain of human fibronectin with three randomized regions at positions 23-29, 52-55 and 77-86 (amino acid nos. are referenced to SEQ ID NO:1) (three loop library; Xu et al, Chemistry &amp; Biology 9:933-942, 2002). After conversion to mRNA/cDNA heteroduplexes, the library of a trillion mRNA/cDNA-protein fusions was bound to 100 nM biotinylated IGF-IR in solution, and captured on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The cDNA was eluted, amplified by PCR, and used to generate a new library of mRNA/cDNA-protein fusions. Five rounds of selection were carried out in this manner and the percentage of library binding to IGF-IR was monitored by quantitative PCR after every round to identify target binding enrichment (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>).</p>

      <heading id="h-00036-en" level="1">Identification of Competitive IGF-IR Clones</heading>
      <p id="p-00279-en" num="0277">Proteins encoded by independent clones were analyzed for inhibition of target binding in the presence of IGF-IR using a competitive binding assay. Over one hundred clones were identified that inhibited the binding of IGF-I to IGF-IR, suggesting that these clones bound IGF-IR at or near the natural ligand (IGF-I) binding site. The SEQ ID NOs (see <figref>FIG. 30</figref>) of these one hundred clones and their percent inhibition in the competitive binding assay are presented in Table 1.</p>

      <p id="p-00282-en" num="0279">Clones that were able to compete with IGF-I were sequenced and aligned using Vector NTI (Invitrogen). Most of the clones fell into three distinct families. One family was recognized by a conserved valine at position 6 of the BC loop and variable length FG loops containing a conserved arginine and tyrosine (Clones 218C04, 215D09, 214C04, 214F03, 214CO3, 214E01, and 218F09). A second family was recognized by a conserved tyrosine and proline in the DE loop and was usually associated with an FG loop of exactly 10 amino acids (Clones 225D03, 215E09, 215B07, 215D11, 218E09, 309B01, 310A01, and 310A03). A third family of clones had an FG loop of 14 amino acids with conserved hydrophobic amino acids (Clones 223B01, 223B02, and 218F08). The remaining clones showed no similarity to the other families, could not be grouped into distinct families, and are not shown.</p>

      <p id="p-00283-en" num="0280">The clones resulting from the above selection process are likely not to meet the stringent affinity, specificity, and biophysical requirements of a biotherapeutic and therefore require further mutagenesis wherein the binding loops are refined, or âoptimized.â In order to identify the clones farthest along this trajectory, a selected number of candidates were subjected to in-depth characterization. In this example, the characterization of one IGF-IR-competitive clone, 218C04, is described.</p>
      <p id="p-00284-en" num="0281">A one liter <i>E. coli </i>growth was prepared and clone 218C04 was purified as indicated by SDS PAGE (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). In an examination of biophysical properties, 218C04 was virtually all monomeric as reflected by SEC (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>) suggesting that this clone did not have a propensity to produce stable aggregates at higher protein concentrations. Surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore) analysis of the purified product revealed that the clone injected in the solution phase bound to immobilized IGF-IR with a KD of 1.8 nM. Collectively, these properties indicated that this clone was suitable for optimization.</p>

Following HTPP and quantitation, many clones exhibit superior inhibition to the staring clone with IC50s in the low nM range (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>). One clone in particular, 338A06, appeared to have an IC50 at or below 1 nM in this assay (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>).</p>

      <p id="p-00292-en" num="0287">Following optimization of selected clones and assessment of derivatives for inhibition of the IGF-IGF-IR interaction in a competitive assay, clones were sequenced. See SEQ ID NOS: 110-125 in <figref>FIG. 30</figref> and Table 2. Similar to the parental clone 218C04 in this example, all inhibitory derivatives clones contained a conserved valine residue in the BC loop. In addition, a conserved hydrophobic residue, typically leucine, was also frequently observed at a conserved position in the BC loop.</p>
      <p id="p-00293-en" num="0288">The FG loops of optimized clones also shared conserved residues with the parental clone 218C04 in specific positions in spite of variations in loop length. For this particular family of clones, the arginine-X-tyrosine motif appears to be an important motif required for functionality. This is found in all but one derivative clone and in this clone (354C10, arginine-X-valine) appears to be a tolerated, conservative substitution. Therefore, for the 218C04 family of clones, there appear to be four dominant positions, two in the BC loop and two in the FG loop, that appear to play the largest role in defining IGF-IR binding and inhibitory activity.</p>

      <p id="p-00299-en" num="0292">One liter <i>E. coli </i>growths of selected optimized clones were prepared and the proteins were purified. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) revealed monomeric behavior, in this example for clone 338A06 (<figref>FIG. 9</figref>), indicating that at higher protein concentration, optimized clones did not have a tendency to aggregate. Monomericity was confirmed using SEC combined with Multi-Angle Laser Light Scattering (MALLS). âClassicalâ light scattering (also known as âstaticâ or âRayleighâ scattering or MALLS) provides a direct measure of molecular mass. It is therefore very useful for determining whether the native state of a protein is a monomer or a higher oligomer, and for measuring the masses of aggregates or other non-native species. In the present example, the analysis of clone 338A06 is presented. As shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, SEC MALLS determined a mass of 12,190 Da for clone 338A06 that is well within experimental error for the predicted mass of 11,740 for the His-tagged monomer. This provides additional evidence that the clones are well-behaved monomers in solution.</p>

      <p id="p-00302-en" num="0294">One liter <i>E. coli </i>growths of selected optimized clones were prepared and the proteins were purified. The homology of human IGF-IR to the human insulin receptor is approximately 56%. To ensure that the IGF-IR competitive clones are indeed specific for IGF-IR, they were evaluated at high concentration against the human insulin receptor using BIAcore methodology. The human insulin receptor was immobilized onto a BIAcore chip as was an irrelevant protein to control for non-specific binding. Clones were passed over the chip at 10 Î¼M, a concentration which is more than 10,000-fold greater than the K<sub>D </sub>of binding IGF-IR for the majority of clones. The percentage of signal for insulin binding at similar concentration was recorded and is presented in Table 5. The majority of clones exhibited no or barely detectable binding to the insulin receptor at this high concentration illustrating that they indeed are specific to IGF-IR. The clones exhibiting some degree of binding to the insulin receptor appear to be selective binders.</p>

      <p id="p-00304-en" num="0295">Mass spectrometry of the purified, optimized IGF-IR clones was performed to ensure identity. In the present example, clone 338A06 was examined. The predicted mass of clone 338A06 is 11741 atomic mass units (amu). MALDI TOF mass spectrometry of clone 338A06 revealed a mass of 11741 m/z after calibration with standards (<figref>FIG. 11</figref>). Additional minor species as higher m/z are observed however these are consistent with matrix adducts (<figref>FIG. 11</figref>). Therefore 338A06, and indeed all IGF-IR clones examined, gave masses consistent with their predicted masses.</p>

      <p id="p-00305-en" num="0296">The purified, optimized IGF-IR clones were evaluated in cell-based assays in order to confirm activity. In one example, the inhibition of IGF-I-mediated mitogenesis by a selected clone 338A06 is demonstrated as shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>. The human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line BxPC-3 in IGF-I free medium was treated with a dilution series of clone 338A06 or a commonly used anti-IGF-IR monoclonal antibody (MAB391). After a 24 hour stimulatory exposure to IGF-I the cells were treated with <sup>3</sup>H-Thymidine to measure cellular proliferation. As shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, clone 338A06 inhibited IGF-I-dependant proliferation comparable to the monoclonal antibody control with an IC50 approximately 10-20 nM.</p>
      <p id="p-00306-en" num="0297">In a second cell-based assay, the inhibition of radiolabelled IGF-I binding to an IGF-IR-expressing cancer cell line by clone 338A06 is demonstrated. Human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells were pre-incubated for 30 minutes with clone 338A06, monoclonal antibody MAB391, or unlabeled IGF-1. After the incubation period, radiolabelled IGF-I was added. Cells were subsequently lysed and radioactivity was quantitated. As shown in <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, clone 338A06 and cold IGF-I had essentially comparable IC50s of approximately 1-2 nM whereas the monoclonal antibody appeared to be less potent with an IC50 of approximately 5nM.</p>

      <heading id="h-00064-en" level="1">Optimization of Clone 338A06</heading>
      <p id="p-00307-en" num="0298">One of the commonly seen degradation processes seen for proteins during storage is the oxidation of methionine residues which may result in the potential loss of chemical and physical stability and biological activity. While the fibronectin-based scaffold protein clones do not contain methionine residues in their backbone, a selected number of IGF-IR competitive clones contain methionine in their loops. Optimization was performed in order to select for clones which retained the desirable properties of biological activity and biophysical properties of the starting clone but substituted the undesirable methionine residue(s) in the loops. In the present example, the optimization of clone 338A06, which contains a methionine residue in the FG loop, is shown.</p>
      <p id="p-00308-en" num="0299">Clone 338A06 was optimized using a single library with 6 random amino acids in the FG loop. The sequence of 338A06 (SEQ ID NO: 111) was incorporated into the BC and DE loops of the new library using the appropriate oligonucleotides.</p>
      <p id="p-00309-en" num="0300">The library was constructed as described below and double-stranded DNA was converted into mRNA-protein fusions to give about 1000 copies of each FG loop sequence. PROfusion cycles of amplification, mRNA-protein fusion formation and affinity selection were carried out. In the first round, the biotinylated IGF-IR concentration was 100 nM, but this was dropped in subsequent rounds to enrich for the highest affinity binders.</p>

      <p id="p-00310-en" num="0301">A direct binding assay was used to screen optimized derivatives of clone 338A06 for enhanced binding to IGF-IR. Clones that showed binding in a single-point assay were analyzed further using a gradient of clone concentrations. As shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, a number of derivative clones bound IGF-IR with affinities comparable to the parent clone 338A06. Half-maximal binding was seen at a concentration of approximately 1 nM (<figref>FIG. 14</figref>).</p>

      <heading id="h-00068-en" level="1">Sequences of Optimized 338A06 IGF-IR Competitive Clones</heading>
      <p id="p-00311-en" num="0302">Following FG loop optimization of the 338A06 clone and assessment of derivatives for binding to IGF-IR in the direct binding assay, clones were sequenced. See SEQ ID NOS: 184-202 of <figref>FIG. 30</figref> and Table 6. Of the clones presented in this example, only one clone contains methionine (clone 387A09) in the FG loop and this is in a position distinct from the parental 338A06 clone. Therefore, methionine in the FG loop of 338A06 clone does not appear to be important for functionality. The present invention affords a means of engineering out this destabilizing residue.</p>
      <p id="p-00312-en" num="0303">Consistent with the 218C04 derivation of these clones, the arginine-X-tyrosine motif is retained in all of the products of the 338A06 FG loop optimization effort. This provides yet additional evidence these two residues in this register appear to be dominant determinants in IGF-IR binding and inhibition in the context of the fibronectin-based scaffold protein fold for this particular family.</p>

      <p id="p-00317-en" num="0306">One liter <i>E. coli </i>growths of selected FG loop optimized 338A06 IGF-IR competitive clones were prepared and the proteins were purified. The homology of human IGF-IR to the human insulin receptor is approximately 56%. To ensure that the IGF-IR competitive clones are indeed specific for IGF-IR, they were evaluated at high concentration against the human insulin receptor using BIAcore methodology. The human insulin receptor was immobilized onto a BIAcore chip as was an irrelevant protein to control for non-specific binding. Clones were passed over the chip at 10 Î¼M, a concentration which is more than 10,000-fold greater than the K<sub>D </sub>of binding IGF-IR for the majority of clones. The percentage of signal for insulin binding at similar concentration was recorded and is presented in Table 8. The majority of clones exhibited no detectable binding to the insulin receptor at this high concentration illustrating that these clones are indeed specific to IGF-IR.</p>

Mass spectrometry of the purified, optimized IGF-IR clones was performed to ensure identity. In the present example, clone 387B01 was examined. The predicted mass of clone 387B01 is 11554 atomic mass units (amu). MALDI TOF mass spectrometry of clone 387B01 revealed a mass of approximately 11553 m/z after calibration with standards, well within experimental error of the instrumentation (<figref>FIG. 18</figref>). An additional minor species at higher m/z is observed. (<figref>FIG. 18</figref>). It is uncertain whether this is matrix adduct or a minor post-translationally modified species. Therefore 387B01, and indeed all IGF-IR clones examined, gave masses consistent with their predicted masses.</p>

      <p id="p-00326-en" num="0312">The single sulfhydryl of the cysteine residue at position 97 was used to couple to PEG variants using standard maleimide chemistry to yield two different PEGylated forms of 385A08. Both a linear 20 kDa bifunctional PEG and a mono-functional branched 40 kDa PEG (NOF Corporation) were conjugated to clone 385A08 to produce 385A08-PEG20-385A08 and 385A08-PEG40, respectively. The PEGylated protein forms were purified from unreacted protein and PEG by anion exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. Covalent linkage of the two PEG forms of 385A08 was verified by SDS-PAGE (<figref>FIG. 11</figref>) and mass spectroscopy.</p>

      <p id="p-00327-en" num="0313">Surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore) analysis was performed using recombinant, immobilized IGF-IR and solution-phase analyte in order to determine binding kinetics and binding affinities of 385A08-PEG20-385A08 and 385A08-PEG40 variants. While the 385A08-PEG40 form was found to have an approximately 10-fold slower on-rate (ka) relative to unmodified 385A08, the 385A08-PEG20-385A08 form has an approximately two-fold faster on-rate (Table 10). The off-rates (kd; Table 10) of the variants relative to unmodified 385A08 were slightly increased for the 385A08-PEG40 form and slightly decreased for the 385A08-PEG20-385A08 variant.</p>

      <p id="p-00329-en" num="0314">The PEGylated fibronectin-based scaffold variants were assessed for inhibition of serum mediated proliferation using the human plasmacytoma cell line NCI-H929. In this cell line, the anti-IGF-IR MAB391 and the unmodified 385A08 demonstrated comparable degrees of inhibition of cell growth with an apparent IC50 of approximately 100 pM. The 385A08-PEG40 variant was slightly less inhibitory with an IC50 approaching 1 nM. On the other hand, the PEG20-385A08-PEG20 variant was extremely potent and essentially 100% inhibitory at all concentrations tested. Therefore an IC50 was less than 100 fM.</p>

      <heading id="h-00105-en" level="2">Primary Library Construction:</heading>
      <p id="p-00349-en" num="0329">A diverse library was constructed by extension of the overlapping synthetic oligonucleotides listed above, using KOD polymerase (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, Calif.). In these oligonucleotide designations, âNâ indicates a mixture of A, C, G and T; and âSâ indicates a mixture of C and G. Loop definitions are identical to those described previously (Xu et al, 2002). The BC loop was constructed by extension of 50 pmol FnBC with 100 pmol FnCD in a 100 Î¼D reaction that was supplemented with 1M Betaine and 3% DMSO. The reaction was taken through 10 temperature cycles of 30s at 94Â° C., 30s at 52Â° C. and 1 min at 68Â° C. to ensure complete extension of the fragments. The DE and FG loops were constructed in a similar manner, using 200 pmol FnDE with 100 pmol FnEF for the DE loop and 100 pmol FnFG10 with 200 pmol FnG for the FG loop. Following extension of the 3 individual loops, the DE and FG loops were combined and extended together for an additional 10 temperature cycles of 30s at 94Â° C., 30s at 52Â° C. and lmin at 68Â° C. The BC loop was extended with 100 pmol FnAB in the same manner. The DE/FG mixture and the BC loop were each diluted 10-fold with fresh KOD reagents and extended with FLAG and T7TMV respectively, for 10 temperature cycles 30s at 94Â° C., 30s at 52Â° C. and lmin at 68Â° C. Finally the fragments were combined and extended together for 10 temperature cycles of 30s at 94Â° C., 30s at 52Â° C. and lmin at 68Â° C. This produced a library with 7 random amino acids in the BC loop, 4 random amino acids in the DE loop, and 10 random amino acids in the FG loop. Additional libraries were constructed with different FG loop lengths by using oligonucleotides FnFG6, FnFG8, FnFG12 or FnFG14 instead of FnFG10. The libraries containing FG loop lengths between 6 and 14 amino acids were combined to give a variable-length FG library.</p>

      <p id="p-00351-en" num="0330">Three libraries were constructed in which single loops were replaced with random sequence. The libraries were constructed at the DNA level by overlap extension with KOD polymerase as described above, except that random sequences in two out of three loops were replaced with fixed sequence corresponding to clone 218C04. The fixed sequences were provided in the BC loop by oligonucleotide 218C04BC, and in the DE loop by oligonucleotide 218C04DE, and in the FG loop by oligonucleotide 218C04FG. These replaced the corresponding random oligonucleotides FnBC, FnDE, or FnFG10 during library construction.</p>

The surviving clones in each library contained 2 loops from the parent clone and 1 loop from the random sequence that was compatible with binding of each fibronectin-based scaffold protein. The three random loops, one from each library, were amplified using oligonucleotide primers that bound the surrounding scaffold regions. The BC loop was amplified from the library containing the variable BC loop using oligonucleotide primers FnB and FnCD. The DE loop was amplified from the library containing the variable DE loop using oligonucleotide primers FnD and FnEF.

      <heading id="h-00106-en" level="2">RNA-Protein Fusion Production:</heading>
      <p id="p-00357-en" num="0334">Double-stranded DNA libraries were converted into RNA-protein fusions (PROfusion) essentially as described (Xu et al, 2002, Kurz et al, <i>Nuc. Acid Res</i>. 28:83, 2000). Briefly, the DNA library was transcribed using an in vitro transcription kit (MEGAscriptâ¢, Ambion, Austin, Tex.) and the resulting RNA was desalted by size exclusion chromatography on a NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare). 2 nmol RNA was crosslinked by irradiation at 314 nM for 20 min in 200 Î¼l of a solution containing 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH8) and a 1.5-fold excess of puromycin-containing linker (5â²-Pso u agc gga ugc XXX XXX CC Pu-3â² (Pu=puromycin, Pso=C6-psoralen, u, a, g, c=2â²-OMe-RNA, X=9-atom PEG spacer.))</p>
      <p id="p-00358-en" num="0335">The mRNA-puromycin molecules were then translated in 3 ml rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Ambion, Austin, Tex.) in the presence of <sup>35</sup>S-labeled methionine. The resulting mRNA-protein fusions were purified using oligo dT cellulose (GE Healthcare) and reverse-transcribed using superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 2 nmol of the primer FLAG according to the manufacturers instructions.</p>
      <p id="p-00359-en" num="0336">The cDNA/mRNA-protein fusions were purified by M2 Flag agarose (Sigma, St Louis, Mo.) and quantitated by measuring the incorporated <sup>35</sup>S methionine.

      <heading id="h-00107-en" level="2">Affinity Selection for Binding to IGF-IR:</heading>
      <p id="p-00360-en" num="0337">Libraries of mRNA-protein fusions, prepared as described above, were incubated with Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (M280 Streptavidin, Invitrogen) to remove fibronectin-based scaffold proteins that bind to Streptavidin. The beads were separated on a magnet and the unbound fraction was collected and added to 100 nM biotinylated IGF-IR in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 1 mg/ml BSA (Ambion). After 30 min, the bound fibronectin-based scaffold proteins were captured on Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and washed 6 times using a Kingfisher magnetic particle processor (Thermo Electron, Waltham, Mass.). The cDNA was eluted in 100 mM KOH, neutralized with 100 mM Tris-HCl, and amplified by PCR to generate a second-generation library enriched in molecules that bind IGF-IR. The consecutive processes of amplification, synthesis of mRNA-protein fusions, and affinity selection were carried out a total of 5 times and the number of bound molecules was monitored by quantitative PCR. The fibronectin-based scaffold protein populations obtained after rounds 4 and 5 were amplified and ligated by recombination (InFusionâ¢, Clontech, Mountain View, Calif.) into an <i>E. coli </i>expression vector containing a promoter for T7 RNA polymerase and an in-frame His<sub>6 </sub>tag. The ligated mixture was transformed into <i>E. coli </i>strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Invitrogen) that expresses T7 RNA polymerase upon induction with IPTG, thereby giving inducible protein expression.</p>
      <heading id="h-00108-en" level="2">Optimization of Clone 218C04 Containing 3 Random Loops:</heading>
      <p id="p-00361-en" num="0338">The 3-loop randomized 218C04 library was taken through cycles of amplification, synthesis of mRNA-protein fusions, and affinity selections as described above. For the first round, IGF-IR was immobilized on epoxy-activated beads to avoid selection of streptavidin-binding peptides. Thereafter, biotinylated IGF-IR was used at decreasing concentrations to select for the highest affinity binders. From round 2 onwards, non-biotinylated insulin receptor (IR) was also included at a concentration of 1 Î¼M to act as a negative selection for IR binding. After 4 rounds, the resulting fibronectin-based scaffold protein populations were cloned into <i>E. coli </i>for analysis as described above.</p>
      <heading id="h-00109-en" level="2">Optimization of Clone 338A06 Containing a 6 Amino Acid Random FG Loop:</heading>
      <p id="p-00362-en" num="0339">The DNA library was converted into mRNA-protein fusions as described above to give about 1000 copies of each FG loop sequence. PROfusion cycles of amplification, mRNA-protein fusion formation and affinity selection were carried out as described above. In the first round, the biotinylated IGF-IR concentration was 100 nM, but this was dropped to 0.8 nM in round 2 and 0.4 nM in round 3. The target concentration was chosen such that the percentage of mRNA-protein fusions bound to IGF-IR was less than 0.1% in each case, as measured by quantitative PCR. By this method, fibronectin-based scaffold proteins with improved affinity would have an advantage compared to the population as a whole.</p>
