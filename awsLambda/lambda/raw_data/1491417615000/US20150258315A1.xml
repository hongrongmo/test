      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to devices, methods and systems for treating headaches and cerebral neurovascular disorders, and more specifically, to devices, such as a surgical device, and methods for using such device, for delivering medication to the sphenopalatine ganglion.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) is a collection (or bundle) of nerves that is located in a bony cavity within an individual's skull. The cavity is called the pterygopalatine fossa (or sphenopalatine fossa). There is an SPG and corresponding sphenopalatine fossa located on each side of the skull.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The SPG and sphenopalatine fossa are accessible via an individual's nasal cavity. Individuals who suffer from pain associated with headaches and/or facial aches may elect to undergo a procedure referred to as a sphenopalatine ganglion block, which is a procedure that includes the application of a medication, such as anesthetic, by a trained professional to the SPG. Some of the conventional techniques for performing a sphenopalatine ganglion block procedure, however, are unpleasant to the individual. For example, upon application of the medication to the SPG, a large majority of the medication may flow down the individual's throat. Additionally, the medication is typically distasteful, which further exacerbates the unpleasantness. Furthermore, typical devices used to perform a sphenopalatine ganglion block procedure may not have the ability to accurately locate the SPG without the use of large external imaging systems, such as x-ray systems.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need for a device, method and/or system such as a surgical device that has the capability to quickly and accurately locate the SPG while performing a sphenopalatine ganglion block procedure, as well as prevent the medication applied to the SPG from flowing down a patient's throat. The present disclosure discusses a method and device that satisfies such needs.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The method may include delivering a medication to a sphenopalatine ganglion of a patient comprising the steps of inserting a device into a nasal cavity of a patient through a nostril, wherein the device comprises a handle comprising a proximal end and a distal end, an inflation device at least partially and integrally disposed within the handle, a flexible tubular member extending from the distal end of the handle, the flexible tubular member comprising a proximal end, a distal end, an inflation lumen coupled to the plunger and extending from the proximal end of the flexible tubular member, and a second lumen extending from the proximal end of the flexible tubular member to a port, an expandable member attached to the flexible tubular member, the expandable member comprising a proximal end and as distal end, wherein the inflation lumen opens into the expandable member, wherein the port is disposed proximally of the proximal end of the expandable member, and an illumination device disposed adjacent the distal end of the flexible tubular member and distally of the expandable member, and activating the illumination device, placing the expandable member adjacent the patient's choana, expanding the expandable member adjacent the patient's choana, introducing a medication to sphenopalatine ganglion through the port in the flexible tubular member, removing at least a portion of the medication from the port in the flexible tubular member, collapsing the expandable member, and removing the device from the nasal cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">A device in accordance with this disclosure for accurately locating the SPG, while performing a sphenopalatine ganglion block procedure, and/or for preventing the medication applied to the SPG from flowing down a patient's throat, may include a handle comprising a proximal end and a distal end, an inflation device at least partially and integrally disposed within the handle, a flexible tubular member extending from the distal end of the handle, the flexible tubular member comprising a proximal end, a distal end, an inflation lumen coupled to the plunger and extending from the proximal end of the flexible tubular member, and a second lumen extending from the proximal end of the flexible tubular member to a port, an expandable member attached to the flexible tubular member, the expandable member comprising a proximal end and as distal end, wherein the inflation lumen opens into the expandable member, wherein the port is disposed proximally of the proximal end of the expandable member, and an illumination device disposed adjacent the distal end of the flexible tubular member and distally of the expandable member.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The device may also or alternatively include a switch on the handle for activating the illumination device.</p>

      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">An alternative device in accordance with this disclosure for use in performing a sphenopalatine ganglion block, which may involve delivering medication to a patient, or other type of medical procedure may include a handle comprising a proximal end and a distal end, an inflation device at least partially disposed within the handle, a flexible tubular member extending from the distal end of the handle, the flexible tubular member comprising a proximal end, a distal end, an inflation lumen coupled to the plunger and extending from the proximal end of the flexible tubular member, and a second lumen extending from the proximal end of the flexible tubular member to a port, an expandable member attached to the flexible tubular member, the expandable member comprising a proximal end and a distal end, wherein the inflation lumen opens into the expandable member, an illumination device disposed adjacent the distal end of the flexible tubular member and distally of the expandable member, and a stabilizer slidably coupled to the flexible tubular member, wherein the stabilizer is capable of sliding along the flexible tubular member between the handle and the expandable member.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The device may also or alternatively be designed such that the stabilizer comprises a lumen, wherein the flexible tubular member is slidably disposed within the lumen, which has a proximal end and a distal end. The stabilizer may also or alternatively be compressible such that it has an uncompressed state and a compressed state. Additionally, the distal end of lumen within the stabilizer may also an oval cross-sectional profile when the stabilizer is in the uncompressed state a circular cross-sectional profile when the stabilizer is in the uncompressed state or vice versa.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The stabilizer may also or alternatively be configured such that the stabilizer is compressible. When the flexible tubular member is disposed in the lumen and the stabilizer is able to slide relative to the flexible tubular member, the stabilizer is able to slide over the flexible tubular member when the stabilizer is in a compressed state and is prevented from sliding over and relative to the flexible tubular member when the stabilizer is in an uncompressed state. The sliding of the stabilizer relative to the flexible tubular member is potentially made possible by the size of the circumference of the lumen being greater than the size of the circumference of the flexible tubular member during such sliding action, regardless of whether the stabilizer is in its compressed state or its uncompressed state, thereby insuring that the stabilizer can slide relative to the flexible tubular member. Accordingly, the stabilizer may be prevented from sliding over the flexible tubular member when one or more portions of the lumen contacts one or more portions the flexible tubular member, which may occur when the stabilizer is in an uncompressed state because portions of the oval shaped lumen contact the flexible tubular member. That is, when the stabilizer is in an uncompressed state it is unable to slide over the flexible tubular member due to the frictionally contact between the stabilizer and the flexible tubular member.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">An alternative method in accordance with this disclosure for performing a sphenopalatine ganglion block, which may involve delivering medication to a patient, or other type of medical procedure may include inserting a device into a portion of a nasal cavity of a patient through a nostril, the device comprising a handle comprising a proximal end and a distal end, an inflation device at least partially disposed within the handle, a flexible tubular member extending from the distal end of the handle, the flexible tubular member comprising a proximal end, a distal end, an inflation lumen coupled to the plunger and extending from the proximal end of the flexible tubular member, and a second lumen extending from the proximal end of the flexible tubular member to a port, an expandable member attached to the flexible tubular member, the expandable member comprising a proximal end and a distal end, wherein the inflation lumen opens into the expandable member, wherein the port is disposed proximally of the proximal end of the expandable member, an illumination device disposed adjacent the distal end of the flexible tubular member and distally of the expandable member, and a stabilizer slidably coupled to the flexible tubular member, wherein the stabilizer is capable of sliding along the flexible tubular member between the handle and the expandable member, activating the illumination device, placing the expandable member adjacent the patient's choana, expanding the expandable member adjacent the patient's choana, sliding the stabilizer adjacent the patient's nose, introducing a medication to sphenopalatine ganglion through the port in the flexible tubular member, removing at least a portion of the medication through the port in the flexible tubular member, collapsing the expandable member sliding the stabilizer distal the patient's nose, and removing the device from the nasal cavity.</p>

      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">Before any embodiments of the disclosure are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the disclosure is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following drawings. The disclosure is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of âincluding,â âcomprising,â or âhavingâ and variations thereof herein is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">Embodiments according to this disclosure provide a surgical device that can be deployed safely within a nasal cavity of a patient and apply a medication, such as a local anesthetic, to the patient's sphenopalatine ganglion. <figref>FIG. 1-FIG</figref>. <b>4</b> depict a surgical device <b>100</b> having a handle <b>104</b> and an elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. The handle <b>104</b>, which is ergonomically shaped, includes a proximal end and a distal end <b>144</b>. The proximal end of the handle includes two projecting abutments <b>136</b>, <b>140</b> so that the user's hand remains comfortably on the handle <b>104</b> during use and the user's hand does not slide off the handle <b>104</b>. It may be preferable for the projecting abutments <b>136</b>, <b>140</b> to be disposed on the top and bottom of the handle such that they are about 180 degrees opposed from one another, as illustrated in the <figref>FIGS. 1 &amp; 2</figref>, or it may be preferable for the projecting abutments <b>136</b>, <b>140</b> to be disposed in a different orientation with respect to the handle, such as on the sides of the handle <b>104</b>. It may also be preferable to have less or more than two abutments. For example, it may be preferable to have a continuous abutment around the entire circumference of the handle <b>104</b> at or near its proximal end. As will be discussed in more detail below, when operating the handgrip or finger grip, such as a ring <b>158</b>, the projecting abutments <b>136</b>, <b>140</b> allow the clinician to ergonomically and comfortably depress and retract the barrel <b>172</b>. For example, the clinician may insert his thumb in the ring <b>158</b> and locate his fingers on the distal side of the projecting abutments <b>136</b>, <b>140</b> and depress the barrel <b>172</b> with one hand.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the handle <b>104</b> is curved. The proximal portion of the handle <b>104</b> has one longitudinal axis and the distal portion of the handle <b>104</b> has a different longitudinal axis. The longitudinal axis of the distal portion of the handle <b>104</b> may be offset at an angle of about 5 degrees about 60 degrees from the longitudinal axis of the proximal portion of the handle <b>104</b>. It may be preferable for the offset angle to be about 10 degrees about 45 degrees and even more preferable for the offset angle to be about 20 degrees to about 30 degrees. The longitudinal axes of the proximal and distal portions of the handle <b>104</b> smoothly intersect, thereby creating a handle with a curved profile. The distal end <b>144</b> of the of the handle portion <b>104</b> may also have a rounded configuration, which is more ergonomic to engage the patient's nostril(s) upon insertion of the device <b>100</b>, namely the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>, thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">The elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> includes a proximal end <b>120</b>, which is attached to the distal end of the 144 of the handle <b>104</b>. An expandable member <b>116</b>, such as a balloon, is located at, adjacent to or toward the distal end <b>124</b> of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. <figref>FIGS. 1 &amp; 3</figref> depict the expandable member <b>116</b> in an inflated state, and <figref>FIGS. 2 &amp; 4</figref> depict the expandable member <b>116</b> in a deflated state. The shape and size of the expandable member <b>116</b> may differ depending upon the patient's anatomy. For example, the size of the expandable member <b>116</b> may be smaller for children and larger for adults. It may be preferable for the expandable member <b>116</b> to have an inflated diameter of about 1 cm to 4 cm, with a possible preferential diameter of about 2.5 cm, and an inflated length of about 1 cm to 3, with a possible preferential inflated length of about 2.5 cm.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">As discussed in more detail below, the handle <b>104</b> includes an inflation device, such as a syringe <b>112</b>, integrated therein. The syringe <b>112</b> comprises a barrel <b>172</b>, a plunger <b>164</b> at least partially disposed within the barrel <b>172</b>, and a distal tip <b>176</b> at the end of the barrel <b>172</b>. When the plunger <b>164</b> is depressed, the expandable member <b>116</b> is expanded (inflated) with fluid, such as air, and when the plunger <b>164</b> is refracted, the expandable member <b>116</b> is collapsed (deflated). It shall be understood that either a pneumatic inflation device, which utilizes air as the fluid, or a hydraulic inflation device, which utilizes liquid (e.g., saline, water, etc.) as the fluid, can be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">The handle <b>104</b> also includes a switch <b>128</b> for activating an illumination device <b>216</b>, such as a light-emitting diode (LED) disposed at or toward the distal end <b>124</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. The switch <b>216</b> activates a power source, such as a battery, that is coupled to the illumination device <b>216</b> by two or more conductors (e.g., wires) <b>224</b>, <b>228</b>. The wires <b>224</b>, <b>228</b> are disposed within lumens <b>224</b>, <b>228</b> that travel from the proximal end to the distal end of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. As discussed above, the expandable member <b>116</b> is also disposed at or near or toward the distal end <b>124</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. It is preferable for the illumination device <b>216</b> to be disposed distally of the expandable member <b>116</b> along the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>, thereby allowing the illumination device <b>216</b> to project light in a manner that is unobstructed by the expandable member <b>116</b>. That is, it is preferable for the expandable member <b>116</b> to be disposed proximally of the illumination device <b>216</b> along the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. For example, it may be preferable for the distal end of the expandable member <b>116</b> to be disposed about 0 to 1 mm and potentially even more preferable to be disposed at the distal end <b>124</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">An alternative illumination device <b>216</b> may include an illumination fiber (not shown) that is attached to and/or integral with the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> such that the illumination fiber is exposed at the same location that the LED would have been disposedâat or toward the distal end <b>124</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. The proximal end of the illumination is coupled to a light source that can be disposed interiorly and/or exteriorly of the handle <b>104</b>. The light source can be powered by a direct current power source or an alternating current power source.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">Referring to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, there is depicted a side view of an embodiment of the surgical device <b>100</b> of the present disclosure. <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of the distal end <b>124</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> illustrating a portion of the expandable member <b>116</b> in a deflated state. The distal end <b>124</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> includes a cover <b>220</b> coupled to it. The cover <b>220</b> is constructed of a transparent material, such as polycarbonate. The cover <b>220</b> protects the illumination device <b>216</b>. The cover <b>220</b> may also be shaped such that its edges are curved, thereby providing an atraumatic end to the surgical device. The cover <b>220</b> can be coupled directly to the distal face <b>222</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> and/or it can be coupled to the perimeter of the distal end <b>124</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. The tip <b>220</b> may preferably be coupled to the distal end <b>124</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> by an adhesive compound. Alternative means of coupling the tip <b>220</b> to the distal end <b>124</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> includes mechanical means, such as pressed fittings, snap on fittings, or a threaded arrangement between the tip <b>220</b> and the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">Continuing to refer to <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>, there is depicted an illumination device <b>216</b>, which is also coupled to the distal face <b>222</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> such that the illumination device projects light distally of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. Similar to tip <b>220</b>, the illumination device <b>216</b> is coupled to the distal end <b>124</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> by an adhesive. It may also be preferable for the tip <b>220</b> to surround at least a portion of the illumination device <b>216</b>, thereby protecting the illumination device <b>216</b>. The illumination device is powered by a power source, such as a battery, via one or more wires <b>224</b>, <b>228</b> that couple the power source to the illumination device <b>216</b>. The wires <b>224</b>, <b>228</b> are disposed within lumens <b>224</b>, <b>228</b> that travel from the proximal end to the distal end of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">Referring to <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, there is depicted a cross-sectional view of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> of the surgical device <b>100</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 4</figref> taken along line B-B. The elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> comprises a plurality of lumens. Although a different number of lumens may be used, <figref>FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates four lumens: lumen <b>148</b> is used to transport the medication to/from the medication port <b>160</b> located proximally of the expandable member <b>116</b>; lumen <b>200</b> is used to transport fluid (e.g., air, water, saline, etc.) to/from the inflation port, which open into the expandable member <b>116</b>; and two lumens <b>204</b>, <b>208</b> provide channels for the wires <b>224</b>, <b>228</b> to travel. All four lumens <b>148</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>204</b> &amp; <b>208</b> have openings at the proximal end of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. Not all four lumens, however, may have openings at the distal end of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. For example, the lumen <b>148</b> used to transport the medication may have an opening at the proximal end of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> and an opening (or port) at <b>160</b> through the wall of the tubular member <b>108</b>, which is located proximally of the expandable member <b>116</b>. Additionally, the lumen <b>200</b> used to transport fluid to inflate the expandable member <b>116</b> may have a have an opening at the proximal end of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> and an opening (or port) at <b>212</b>, which opens into the expandable member <b>116</b>. Lumens <b>204</b>, <b>208</b> may have an opening at the proximal end of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> and an opening at or near the distal end of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>, thereby allowing the wires <b>224</b>, <b>228</b> to travel all or the majority of the length of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> to the illumination device <b>216</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">Alternatively, the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> may not have lumens <b>204</b>, <b>208</b>. For example, if the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> is constructed (e.g., molded) in a manner such that the wires <b>224</b>, <b>228</b> are integral with the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>, then lumens <b>204</b>, <b>208</b> may not be needed. Additionally, the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> may have additional lumens <b>206</b>, <b>210</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">Another alternative embodiment may include an additional lumen in the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> through which an imaging device may be inserted or incorporated. For instance, the surgical device <b>100</b> may include a reusable endoscope that is inserted through an opening (not shown) in the handle <b>104</b> and travels through the additional lumen in the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> such that the endoscope is adjacent the illumination device <b>216</b> in the cover <b>220</b>. Referring to <figref>FIGS. 8A</figref>, <b>8</b>B &amp; <b>8</b>C, there is depicted such an alternative embodiment of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>â² that includes lumen <b>202</b>â², which extends from the proximal end to the distal end of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>â², and is configured to have an endoscope or other imaging device inserted thereto. Lumen <b>148</b>â² will be used to transport the medication to/from the medication port <b>160</b>â² located proximally of the expandable member <b>116</b>; two lumens <b>204</b>, <b>208</b> provide channels for the wires <b>224</b>, <b>228</b> to travel to/from the illumination device <b>220</b>; lumen <b>206</b>â² is used to transport fluid (e.g., air, water, saline, etc.) to/from the inflation port, which open into the expandable member <b>116</b>; and lumen <b>208</b>â² is an additional lumen. Although it is not shown in the figures, it may also be desirable for the cover and/or the distal end of the flexible tubular member to have an optical divider that separates the light emitted by the illumination device from directly entering the endoscope or imaging device.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">Regarding the placement of the opening <b>160</b> through the wall of the tubular member <b>108</b> for delivering the medication, it may be preferable for the opening <b>160</b> to be disposed about 1 mm to 10 mm from the proximal end of the expandable member <b>116</b> and possibly more preferably to be disposed about 2 mm to 5 mm from the proximal end of the expandable member <b>116</b>. Locating the opening <b>160</b> through the wall of the tubular member <b>108</b> proximally of the proximal end of the expandable member <b>116</b> allows the medication to collect within the nasal cavity above the expandable member <b>116</b>, while the expandable member <b>116</b> is inflated. It may be preferable for the medication to collect within the nasal cavity and form a pool of medication such that the level of medication rises to sphenopalatine fossa and/or the mucosa overlaying the SPG. Depending upon the size of the patient's nasal cavity, the volume of medication introduced to the nasal cavity and used to create such a pool may be between 2 milliliters to 15 milliliters, and potentially preferable for about 5 milliliters to 10 milliliters.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">Referring to <figref>FIG. 4D</figref>, <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>. <figref>FIG. 5B</figref> and <figref>FIG. 5C</figref>, an inflation device, such as a syringe <b>112</b>, is integrated into the handle <b>104</b>. The syringe <b>112</b> is used to inflate and deflate the expandable member <b>116</b>. Integrating the inflation device in the handle <b>104</b> reduces the likelihood of a clinician confusing which port(s) to connect the devices (i.e., syringes) used to introduce the medication and the inflation fluid. That is, by including an inflation device, such as the syringe <b>112</b>, in the handle <b>104</b>, a clinician will know and/or be instructed to use the integrated syringe <b>112</b> to inflate the expandable member <b>116</b> and an external syringe (not shown) to introduce the medication. Stated differently, a clinician will only have to introduce one fluid, namely the medication, through an external syringe, thereby reducing potential confusion as to which fluid to introduce and/or into which port. Alternatively, the syringe used to introduce the medication may be integrated into the handle <b>104</b> in lieu of the syringe <b>112</b> used to inflate and deflate the expandable member <b>116</b>. A further alternative embodiment may include a handle <b>104</b> with two clearly marked integrated syringesâone syringe for the medication and another syringe for the inflation fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">The syringe <b>112</b> comprises a barrel <b>172</b>, a plunger <b>164</b> at least partially disposed within the barrel <b>172</b>, and a distal tip <b>176</b> having an opening at the distal end of the barrel <b>172</b>. The plunger <b>164</b> has a shaft portion <b>166</b> and a proximal end <b>162</b> and distal end <b>168</b> at the respective ends of the shaft portion <b>166</b>. A cross section of the shaft portion <b>166</b> is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5C</figref>, which depicts the shaft portion <b>166</b> as having an âXâ or âTâ cross sectional profile. This cross sectional profile potentially increases the strength and rigidity of the shaft portion <b>166</b>. The proximal end <b>162</b> and a distal end <b>168</b> may be coupled to the shaft portion <b>166</b> or be integrally formed thereto. The proximal portion <b>162</b> may also have a handgrip or finger grip, such as a ring <b>158</b>, for a clinician to ergonomically and comfortably depress and retract the barrel <b>172</b>. When the plunger <b>164</b> is depressed, the expandable member <b>116</b> is inflated, and when the plunger <b>164</b> is retracted, the expandable member <b>116</b> is deflated.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">It may also be preferable for the barrel <b>172</b> to have an opening (port) <b>170</b> through the wall of the tubular member <b>108</b> adjacent, at or toward its proximal end. When the surgical device <b>100</b> is manufactured, it is assembled and/or packaged at a certain atmospheric pressure depending upon the geographic location of the manufacturing and/or packaging facility. The atmospheric pressure of the surgical site where the surgical device <b>100</b> is used, however, may be different than that at the manufacturing and/or packaging facility. Including the opening <b>170</b> through the wall of the barrel <b>172</b> allows the pressure within barrel to equalize with the pressure of the surgical site prior to use. It may also be preferable to ship the surgical device <b>100</b> in a configuration such that the plunger <b>164</b> is in a partially or fully retracted position such, thereby allowing the opening <b>170</b> to be located distally of the distal end <b>168</b> of the plunger <b>164</b>. Shipping the surgical device in this configuration may enhance the time for the pressure within the chamber of the barrel to equalize with the atmospheric pressure at the surgical site more quickly.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">During use of the surgical device <b>100</b>, clinicians may also repeatedly depress and retract the plunger <b>164</b>. Such repeated action has the potential to overinflate the expandable member <b>116</b>. Inclusion of the opening <b>170</b> through the wall of the barrel <b>172</b> allows the pressure within barrel's chamber <b>174</b> to equalize with the atmospheric pressure upon retraction of the plunger <b>164</b>, thereby reducing the likelihood of overinflating the expandable member <b>116</b>. That is, upon depression of the plunger <b>164</b>, the pressure within the chamber <b>174</b>, as well as the pressure within the expandable member <b>116</b>, increases above atmospheric pressure at the surgical site. Upon each retraction of the plunger <b>164</b>, the pressure within the chamber <b>174</b>, as well as the pressure within the expandable member <b>116</b>, decreases back to atmospheric pressure prior to another depression of the plunger <b>164</b> because the fluid within the chamber <b>174</b> is vented to the atmosphere via the opening <b>170</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">Venting the fluid within the chamber <b>174</b> also allows the expandable member <b>116</b> to deflate (or further deflate) upon application of pressure to the exterior of the expandable member <b>116</b>. For example, upon retraction of the plunger <b>164</b>, the pressure within the expandable member <b>116</b> may not immediately cause the expandable member <b>116</b> to completely deflate. That is, the expandable member <b>116</b> may retain a certain amount of fluid after retraction of the plunger, thereby allowing the expandable member <b>116</b> to remain partially inflated. Accordingly, when the surgical device <b>100</b>, including the expandable member <b>116</b>, is initially removed from the patient's nasal cavity, the expandable member <b>116</b> may be partially inflated. Inclusion of opening <b>170</b> within chamber <b>174</b> allows the expandable member <b>116</b> to further deflate upon removal of the surgical device <b>100</b>, including the expandable member <b>116</b>, from the patient's nasal cavity. Allowing the expandable member <b>116</b> to further deflate upon removal of the surgical device <b>100</b> assists in reducing the likelihood of the expandable member <b>116</b> causing discomfort to the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">Continuing to refer to <figref>FIG. 4D</figref>, a pressure relief valve <b>188</b> is disposed between the syringe <b>112</b> and the expandable member <b>116</b>. Inclusion of the pressure relief valve <b>188</b> into the inflation circuit reduces the possibility of over pressurizing and over expanding the expandable member <b>116</b>, particularly during a clinician's repeated depression and retraction of the plunger <b>164</b>. The pressure relief valve <b>188</b> is a valve used to control or limit the pressure in a circuit, such as the inflation circuit. The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurized fluid (e.g., air) to flow to an auxiliary passage, preferably in the valve, out of the circuit. The pressure relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined set pressure to protect the expandable member <b>116</b> from being subjected to pressures that exceed the desired clinical limits. When the set pressure is exceeded, the pressure relief valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route vented to the atmosphere. As the fluid is diverted, the pressure inside the circuit decreases. Once the pressure within the pressure relief valve reduces back to or below the predetermined set pressure, the valve will close. For example, the predetermined set pressure may be set between about 5 psi (0.345 bars) to 15 psi (1.034 bars) or possibly between about 8 psi (0.552 bars) to 12 psi (0.827 bars) or nominally about 10 psi (0.690 bars).</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">The pressure relief valve <b>188</b>, particularly the proximal end of the pressure relief valve <b>188</b>, is coupled to the distal tip <b>176</b> of the syringe <b>112</b>. The distal end of the pressure relief valve <b>188</b> is, in turn, coupled to the tube <b>192</b> that is coupled to the inflation lumen <b>148</b> in the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. Alternatively, the tube <b>192</b> may be omitted by directly coupling the distal end of the pressure relief valve <b>188</b> to the inflation lumen <b>148</b> in the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">Also disclosed herein is an alternative embodiment included within the surgical device <b>100</b> to accommodate for the change in atmospheric conditions that may exist between the manufacturing and/or packaging facility and the surgical site, while also reducing the likelihood of overinflating the expandable member <b>116</b>. The embodiment of the syringe <b>1312</b> depicted in <figref>FIGS. 13-15</figref> may negate the need for the inclusion of the pressure relief valve <b>18</b> discussed herein above. Referring to <figref>FIGS. 13 and 13A</figref>, as well as <figref>FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B and <b>16</b>C, there is depicted an alternative embodiment of the syringe <b>1312</b> of the present disclosure. The syringe <b>1312</b> comprises a barrel <b>1372</b>, and a plunger <b>1364</b> at least partially inserted within the barrel <b>1372</b>. The plunger <b>1364</b> has a shaft portion <b>1366</b> and a proximal end <b>1362</b> and distal end <b>1368</b> at the respective ends of the shaft portion <b>1366</b>. The barrel <b>1372</b> includes a distal tip <b>1376</b> having an opening at the distal end of the barrel <b>1372</b>. The proximal end <b>1362</b> and a distal end <b>1368</b> of the plunger <b>1364</b> may be coupled to the shaft portion <b>1366</b> or be integrally formed thereto. The proximal portion <b>1362</b> may also have a handgrip or finger grip, such as a ring <b>1358</b>, for a clinician to ergonomically and comfortably depress and retract the barrel <b>1372</b>. When the plunger <b>1364</b> is depressed, the expandable member <b>116</b> is inflated, and when the plunger <b>1364</b> is retracted, the expandable member <b>116</b> is deflated due to the supply and removal of fluid through the inflation lumen <b>148</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">Continuing to refer to <figref>FIGS. 13 and 13A</figref>, as well as <figref>FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B and <b>16</b>C, the proximal end of the barrel <b>1372</b> may include a flange <b>1374</b> that is disposed within a flange recess <b>1388</b> of a housing <b>1384</b>, which is coupled to the handle <b>104</b>. Alternatively, the handle <b>104</b> may include an integral flange recess <b>1388</b> in which the flange <b>1374</b> may be disposed, thereby negating the need for a separate housing <b>1384</b>. Regardless of whether the flange <b>1374</b> of the barrel <b>1372</b> is coupled to the handle <b>104</b> either indirectly by being disposed within the flange recess <b>1388</b> of the housing <b>1384</b>, which is coupled to the handle <b>104</b>, or directly to the handle <b>104</b>, the barrel <b>1372</b> remains positionally fixed with respect to the handle <b>104</b> during shipment and use.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">As discussed above with respect to <figref>FIGS. 5A &amp; 5B</figref>, it may also be preferable for barrel <b>1372</b> of the syringe <b>1312</b> in <figref>FIGS. 13 and 13A</figref> to have an opening (port) <b>1370</b> through the wall of the barrel <b>1372</b> adjacent, at or toward its proximal end. Including an unobstructed opening <b>1370</b> within the proximal end, for example, of the barrel <b>1372</b> allows the pressure within the chamber of the barrel <b>1372</b> to equalize with the pressure of its current geographical location, such as the surgical site prior to use. It may also be preferable to ship the surgical device <b>100</b> in a configuration such that the plunger <b>1364</b> is in fully refracted position, thereby allowing the opening <b>1370</b> to be located distally of the distal end <b>1368</b> of the plunger <b>1364</b> and, therefore, unobstructed. Shipping the surgical device in this configuration allows the opening <b>1370</b> to be unobstructed by the plunger, thereby potentially decreasing the time for the pressure within the chamber of the barrel to equalize with the atmospheric pressure at the surgical site more quickly.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">Continuing to refer to <figref>FIGS. 13 and 13A</figref>, there may be a need to insure that the distal end <b>1368</b>, particularly the seal, of the plunger <b>1364</b> remains proximate the opening <b>1370</b> during shipment of the surgical device <b>100</b>, thereby allowing the atmospheric pressure to enter into the chamber of the barrel <b>1372</b>. It may be preferable, therefore, for the syringe <b>1312</b> to include means for preventing the distal end <b>1368</b>, particularly the seal, of the plunger <b>1364</b> from moving distally of the opening <b>1370</b> in the barrel <b>1372</b> during shipment. One such means may include one or more locking arms <b>1380</b> coupled to the plunger <b>1364</b>, wherein the locking arms <b>1380</b> have an unconstrained radially biased position that is greater than the orifice of the housing <b>1384</b>. Referring to <figref>FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B and <b>16</b>C, there is depicted four locking arms <b>1380</b> attached radially symmetrically around the shaft <b>1366</b> of the plunger <b>1364</b>. Although four locking arms <b>1380</b> are illustrated in these figures, less than four (i.e., 1, 2 or 3) locking arms or greater than four (e.g., 5, 6, etc.) locking arms may be used. Each of the locking arms <b>1380</b> have a proximal end, which are coupled to the proximal end <b>1362</b> of plunger <b>1364</b>, and a distal end <b>1392</b> extending therefrom. The locking arms <b>1380</b> are spring biased in a radially outward direction such that they flare radially outwards at their distal ends <b>1392</b> in comparison to their proximal ends.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">It may also be preferable for the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> to include a male tapered portion which mates with a female tapered portion <b>1400</b> of the housing <b>1384</b>. During shipment and prior to usage of the surgical device <b>100</b>, the male tapered portion of the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> remains proximate the female tapered portion <b>1400</b> of the housing <b>1384</b>. This is accomplished by the radially outward spring bias of the locking arms <b>1380</b> which causes the distal ends <b>1392</b>, and particularly the male tapered portion, of the locking arms <b>1380</b> to have a configuration outside the chamber of the barrel <b>1372</b> such that the distal ends <b>1392</b> and/or the male tapered portion is biased outwardly to a diameter that is greater in diameter than the orifice of the housing, thereby causing the distal end <b>1392</b> and/or male tapered portion of the plunger <b>1364</b> to abut and contact the female tapered portion <b>1400</b> of the housing <b>1384</b>. When the male tapered portion of the distal end <b>1392</b> of the plunger <b>1364</b> abuts and contacts the female tapered portion <b>1400</b> of the housing <b>1384</b>, the seal <b>1368</b> is proximal of the opening <b>1370</b> within the barrel <b>1372</b>. That is, the plunger <b>1364</b>, particularly the shaft portion <b>1366</b> of the plunger <b>1364</b>, has a predetermined length between the distal ends <b>1392</b> and/or the male tapered portions of the distal end <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> and the seal <b>1368</b> such that when the surgical device is in its fully retracted position during shipment and prior to use, the seal <b>1368</b> has a length that is proximal of the opening <b>170</b>, thereby allowing the chamber within the barrel <b>1372</b> to have the same pressure as the atmosphere for the geographic location of the surgical device. As will be discussed herein below, only upon a clinician manually forcing the plunger <b>1364</b> distally will the male tapered portion of the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> engage the female tapered portion <b>1400</b> of the housing <b>1384</b>, thereby allowing the female tapered portion <b>1400</b> and the engagement with the male tapered portion of the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> to cause the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> to move radially inward and distally axial into orifice of the housing <b>1384</b> and the proximal end of the lumen within the barrel <b>1372</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">Referring to <figref>FIG. 13A</figref>, it may also be preferable for the plunger, <b>1364</b> to include one or more cross sectional members <b>1404</b> having a circumference greater than a portion of lumen within the barrel. Such portion may have a reduced diameter at a ledge or ramp <b>1408</b> within the interior of the barrel's chamber. Such cross sectional members <b>1404</b> and ramp <b>1408</b> reduce the likelihood of the plunger <b>1364</b> from moving proximally out of the barrel <b>1372</b> during shipment.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 14 and 14A</figref>, upon opening the package in which the surgical device <b>100</b> is shipped, the plunger <b>1364</b> is in its fully retracted position (or un-activated position). That is, during shipment and prior to use of the surgical device <b>100</b>, the plunger <b>1364</b> is in its fully retracted position (or un-activated position). In order to prepare the surgical device <b>100</b> for use, the clinician may manually force the plunger <b>1364</b> axially in a distal direction such that the male tapered portion of the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> move radially inward upon contacting the female tapered portion <b>1400</b> of the housing <b>1384</b> and into the orifice of the housing <b>1384</b>. After the male tapered portions of the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> move past the orifice of the housing <b>1384</b> and into the lumen of the barrel <b>1372</b>, the resiliency of the locking arms <b>1380</b> forces the distal end <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> to move radially outward. And because the lumen or chamber at the proximal end of the barrel <b>1372</b> is larger than the orifice of the housing <b>1384</b>, the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> are allowed to move radially outward after moving axially past the orifice of the housing<b>1384</b> and into the chamber of the barrel <b>1372</b>. The distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> are flanged in comparison to at least a portion of the locking arms <b>1380</b> proximal thereto, thereby allowing the flanged portions of the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> to be adjacent and/or abut the interior of the ridge <b>1396</b> at the orifice of the housing <b>1384</b>. Once the flanged portions of the distal ends <b>1392</b> and/or the of the locking arms <b>1380</b> move axially past the orifice of the housing <b>1384</b> and into the chamber of the barrel <b>1372</b>, the plunger cannot be removed from the barrel, and the surgical device is in its initial partially retracted position (or activated position) and ready for use. When the surgical device is in its initial partially retracted position (or activated position) atmospheric pressure is prevented from entering into the chamber of the barrel <b>1372</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">The length of the plunger <b>1364</b> is also designed such that, upon the distal end <b>1392</b> (including the flanged portion and male tapered portions) of the locking arms <b>1380</b> springing radially outward upon introduction into the lumen of the barrel <b>1372</b>, the seal at the distal end <b>1368</b> of the plunger <b>1364</b> is disposed at or distally of the opening <b>170</b> in the barrel <b>1372</b>. That is, the plunger <b>1364</b>, particularly the shaft portion <b>1366</b> of the plunger <b>1364</b>, has a predetermined length between the distal endsl<b>392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> and the seal <b>1368</b> such that once the surgical device is in its initial partially retracted position and ready for use, the seal <b>1368</b> aligns with or is distal of the opening <b>170</b>, thereby sealing the barrel's chamber. Sealing the opening <b>170</b> ensures that no additional fluid will enter the chamber and the initial pressure within the lumen of the barrel <b>1372</b> will be equal to that of the atmospheric pressure for the geographic location of the surgical device immediately after sealing.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">Referring to <figref>FIG. 15</figref>, after the flanged portion of the distal end <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> enters the housing <b>1384</b> and/or the barrel <b>1372</b>, the clinician can push the plunger <b>1364</b> towards the distal end <b>1376</b> of the barrel <b>1372</b>. When the plunger <b>1364</b> moves towards the distal end <b>1376</b> of the barrel <b>1372</b>, the seal <b>1368</b> moves distally of the opening <b>1370</b>, thereby increasing the fluid pressure within the barrel's chamber, inflation lumen, and expandable member <b>116</b>, which is then inflated. That is, the plunger <b>1364</b>, particularly the shaft portion <b>1366</b> of the plunger <b>1364</b>, has a predetermined length between the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms and the seal <b>1368</b> such that once the surgical device moves in a axially distal direction from its partially retracted position, the seal <b>1368</b> is distal of the opening <b>170</b> within the barrel <b>1372</b>, thereby continuing to seal the barrel's chamber. After the clinician pushes and extends the plunger distally, the clinician can then pull or retract the plunger <b>1364</b> such that it moves proximally. Due to the locking arms <b>1380</b> being in their sprung radially outward position, the clinician can only pull the plunger proximally to a position wherein the locking arms <b>1380</b> abut and/or are adjacent the interior of the ridge <b>1396</b> at the distal end of the orifice of the housing <b>1384</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 14 and 14A</figref>. Accordingly, the locking arms <b>1380</b> not only serve as a for preventing the distal end <b>1368</b>, particularly the seal, of the plunger <b>1364</b> from moving distally of the opening <b>1370</b> in the barrel <b>1372</b> during shipment, but the locking arms <b>1380</b> also serve as a means for maintaining a sealed chamber during use of the surgical device.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">During use of the surgical device <b>100</b>, clinicians may repeatedly depress and retract the plunger <b>1364</b>. Inclusion of the opening <b>1370</b> through the wall of the barrel <b>1372</b> allows the pressure within barrel's chamber <b>1374</b> reduces the likelihood of overinflating the expandable member <b>116</b> because prior to its use, the chamber <b>1374</b> is at atmospheric pressure for the geographical position at which the surgical device will be used. That is, upon depression of the plunger <b>1364</b>, the pressure within the chamber <b>1374</b>, as well as the pressure within the expandable member <b>116</b>, increases above atmospheric pressure at the surgical site. Upon each retraction of the plunger <b>1364</b>, the pressure within the chamber <b>1374</b>, as well as the pressure within the expandable member <b>116</b>, decreases back to atmospheric pressure prior to another depression of the plunger <b>1364</b> because no additional the fluid will enter the chamber <b>174</b> upon retraction.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0110">When the plunger <b>1364</b> is in a position within the barrel <b>1372</b> such that the male tapered portions of the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> are proximal and/or abuts the female tapered portion <b>1400</b> of the housing <b>1384</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 13 and 13A</figref>, the plunger <b>1364</b> is in its initial fully retracted position, which may be the desirable position for shipment and prior to use. When the plunger <b>1364</b> is in its initial fully retracted position, the locking arms <b>1380</b>, particularly the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b>, are in a fully radially outward extended position relative to the shaft <b>1366</b> portion of the plunger, such that the distal ends <b>1392</b> do not contact the shaft <b>1366</b>, as depicted in <figref>FIG. 16A</figref>. In this initial fully retracted position, the radial exterior of the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> are situated outward relative to the exterior of the shaft portion <b>1366</b>. As the distal ends of the locking arms <b>1380</b> move into and through the orifice of the housing <b>1384</b>, the exterior of the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> and the exterior of the shaft portion <b>1366</b> have the same radial position relative to one another. However, it may be preferable for the exterior of the shaft <b>1366</b> to be situated radially outward in comparison to the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b>, as depicted in <figref>FIG. 16B</figref>, as the locking arms <b>1380</b> pass through the orifice of the housing <b>1384</b> in order to maintain the rotational position of the plunger <b>1364</b> with respect to the housing <b>1384</b> and/or the barrel <b>1372</b>. <figref>FIG. 16B</figref> illustrates the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> contacting the shaft <b>1366</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0111">When the plunger <b>1364</b> is in a position within the barrel <b>1372</b> such that the flanged portions and/or the male tapered portions of the locking arms <b>1380</b> are distal the female tapered portion <b>1400</b> of the housing <b>1384</b> and into the housing <b>1364</b> such as the flange of the distal end <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> abuts and/or is adjacent the interior of the ridge at the orifice of the housing <b>1384</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 14 and 14A</figref>, or distal thereto, the plunger <b>1364</b> is in its partially retracted position and ready for use. When the plunger <b>1364</b> is in a position within the barrel <b>1372</b> such that the flanged portions and/or male tapered portions of the locking arms <b>1380</b> are distal the female tapered portion <b>1400</b> of the housing <b>1384</b> and into the housing <b>1364</b> such that the flange of the distal end <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> is distal the interior of the ridge <b>1396</b> at the orifice of the housing <b>1384</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 15</figref>, the plunger <b>1364</b> is in an extended position. Also, when the plunger <b>1364</b> is in a partially retracted position (as depicted in <figref>FIGS. 14 and 14A</figref>) and/or in an extended position (as depicted in <figref>FIG. 15</figref>), the locking arms <b>1380</b>, particularly the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b>, are in a radially outward extended position relative to the shaft portion <b>1366</b> of the plunger <b>1364</b>, as depicted in <figref>FIG. 16C</figref>. <figref>FIG. 16C</figref> illustrates the distal ends <b>1392</b> of the locking arms <b>1380</b> being spaced apart from and not contacting the shaft <b>1366</b> but having less space between the distal ends <b>1392</b> and the shaft <b>1366</b> in comparison to <figref>FIG. 16A</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0112">Referring again to <figref>FIG. 4D</figref>, this figure also illustrates a female luer adaptor <b>132</b> attached to the surgical device <b>100</b>. The female luer adaptor <b>132</b> allows a clinician to connect an auxiliary syringe (not shown) having a male luer the mates with the female luer adaptor <b>132</b>. The auxiliary syringe will include the medication that is introduced through the surgical device <b>100</b> proximal of the expandable member to the mucosa overlaying the SPG. Upon actuation (e.g., depression) of the auxiliary syringe, the medication travels from the auxiliary syringe to the female luer adaptor <b>132</b> through a tube <b>184</b> to the medication lumen <b>200</b> and eventually to opening <b>160</b>. Alternatively, the tube <b>184</b> may be omitted by directly coupling the female luer adaptor <b>132</b> to the medication lumen <b>200</b>. An additional alternative to the present disclosure includes using a separate tube for delivering the medication in lieu of the medication lumen <b>200</b> within the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. The separate tube could be attached or unattached to the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. The separate tube would have a proximal end, which could be coupled to the auxiliary syringe, and a distal end that includes an opening for delivering the medication.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0113">Regardless of whether a tube <b>184</b> is included, the medication is preferably introduced through the surgical device <b>100</b> after the expandable member <b>116</b> is expanded because expanding the expandable member <b>116</b> reduces the likelihood of the medication from flowing down the patient's throat. As discussed above, after the medication is introduced into the nasal cavity through opening <b>160</b>, the medication collects within the nasal cavity above the expandable member, when the expandable member <b>116</b> is expanded adjacent the choana. It may be preferable for the medication to collect within the nasal cavity and form a pool of medication such that the level of medication rises to sphenopalatine fossa and/or the mucosa overlaying the SPG. Once the desired medication level is attained, it may be desirable for the medication to remain in the patient's nasal cavity for a period of time to maximize the medication's exposure to the mucosa overlaying the SPG and the SPG itself. For example, it may be desirable for the medication to remain in the patient's nasal cavity at a level to overlay the mucosa of the SPG, for a period of time from about 5 minutes to 35 minutes, including any time interval (e.g., 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 4 minutes, 5 minutes, etc.) there between. It may be more desirable for such time period to be about 10 minutes to 30 minutes, and even more desirable for such time period to be about 15 minutes to 25 minutes, and even further desirable for such time period to be about 20 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0114">To assist in maintaining the preferable level of medication for the desired time period, the auxiliary syringe may remain connected to the female luer adaptor <b>132</b> during such time period. After the medication has contacted the mucosa and the SPG for a sufficient period, the clinician may retract the auxiliary syringe, thereby removing some or all of the medication from the patient's nasal cavity through the same opening <b>160</b> used to introduce the medication. That is, by retracting the syringe, a negative pressure or suction force is created in the medication circuit, thereby pulling the medication located within the patient's nasal cavity through the opening <b>160</b> and back into the same or different auxiliary syringe. After the medication is withdrawn from the patient's nasal cavity, the expandable member <b>116</b> is collapsed, and the surgical device <b>100</b> may be removed. As discussed in more detail below, the benefit of including the expandable member <b>116</b> with the surgical device <b>100</b> allows the clinician to create a blockage within the patient's throat and fill a portion of the nasal cavity such that medication directly contacts the mucosa overlaying the SPG for a sustained period while preventing the medication from flowing down the patient's throat.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0115">Referring to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, there is depicted a flow chart <b>700</b> representing at least some of the steps for performing a sphenopalatine ganglion block procedure utilizing the surgical device <b>100</b> of the present disclosure. Some of the steps of the flow chart <b>700</b> are illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 6A-6E</figref>. Step <b>704</b>, which is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 6A</figref>, includes inserting the surgical device <b>100</b> into the patient's nasal cavity through one of the patient's nostrils (i.e., left nostril or right nostril). Specifically, the distal portion of the distal end <b>124</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> is preferably inserted into the patient's nostril, while the expandable member <b>116</b> is entirely or partially deflated, and directed into the channel below the inferior turbinate and above the hard palate. It may also be preferable at the time of insertion of the surgical device <b>100</b> or shortly thereafter, that the illumination device <b>216</b> be activated. Upon activating the illumination device <b>216</b>, light will transmit through the patient's hard palate. For example, when the distal end <b>124</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> (and the illumination device <b>216</b>) is located within the patient's nasal cavity as depicted in <figref>FIG. 6A</figref>, the illumination device <b>216</b> will be located at or below the posterior inferior turbinate and above the hard palate and be visible to a clinician viewing the interior of the oral cavity (patient's mouth), particularly the bottom of the palate (roof of the patient's mouth), and the light will appear to be transilluminating therefrom within the patient's head and visible to clinician from the oral cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0116">Referring to <figref>FIG. 6B</figref>, while continuing to activate the illumination device <b>216</b> and while the expandable member <b>116</b> is entirely or partially deflated, the distal portion of the distal end <b>124</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> is inserted further into the patient's nasal cavity. When the distal end <b>124</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> (and the illumination device <b>216</b>) is located within the patient's nasal cavity as depicted in <figref>FIG. 6B</figref>, the illumination device <b>216</b> will continue to be located below the anterior of the inferior turbinate above the anterior of the hard palate further towards the soft palate in comparison location depicted in <figref>FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>

When the distal end <b>124</b> of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> is located within the patient's nasal cavity as depicted in <figref>FIG. 6C</figref>, the illumination device <b>216</b> will be located above the soft palate, namely the nasopharynx, and the light will appear to be transilluminating therefrom and visible to clinician from the oral cavity. At this point, step <b>704</b> of <figref>FIG. 7</figref> has been completed because the expandable member <b>116</b> is located at the desired position, namely in the nasopharynx adjacent the choana.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0118">It may also be preferable to include depth markers printed on the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>, wherein the depth markers indicate to the clinician the distance from the expandable member <b>116</b> to the corresponding depth marker. For example, it may be preferable for the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> to include depth markers every 1 centimeter, every 5 centimeters, every 10 centimeters from the proximal, mid- or distal portion of the balloon (or from the distal end of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>) to the corresponding depth marker. Adding such depth markers may provide the clinician with an additional or alternative means of determining whether the expandable member <b>116</b> and/or the distal end of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b> is located at the desired position, namely in the nasopharynx adjacent the choana.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0119">Referring to <figref>FIG. 6D</figref>, when the illumination device <b>216</b> and the expandable member <b>116</b> are located in the nasopharynx adjacent the choana, the expandable member <b>116</b> is expanded by depressing plunger <b>164</b> of the syringe <b>112</b>, as depicted in step <b>712</b> of <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, thereby blocking the choana. Once the choana is blocked, medication is introduced to the nasal cavity through the opening <b>160</b> of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. As the medication is introduced, the expanded expandable member <b>116</b> prevents the flow of medication down the patient's throat. And because the patient's head it typically tilted backwards during this procedure, the medication collects proximally above the expandable member <b>116</b>. Accordingly, the medication begins to accumulate within the nasal cavity. Upon a certain volume, such as 5 milliliters to 10 milliliters of medication being introduced to the nasal cavity through the opening <b>160</b>, the level of medication rises within the nasal cavity, namely the sphenopalatine fossa, such that the medication contacts the mucosa overlaying the SPG. Introducing the medication in this fashion and maintaining the desired level of medication provides for direct and sustained contact with the mucosa overlaying the SPG. The medication is absorbed by the permeable mucosa overlying the SPG. In comparison to spraying the mucosa with the medication, the device(s) and method(s) of the present disclosure provide direct and sustained contact with the mucosa and SPG, which is a more effective treatment. Also, varying the medication and contact times may further increase the effectiveness of the treatment. Varying the medication and contact times also provide the clinician the flexibility to personalize the patient's treatment. Another example of the way in which the clinician may utilize the device(s) and method(s) of the present disclosure to personalize the patient's treatment includes inflating the inflatable member to a certain pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0120">As mentioned above, it may be preferable for the patient's head to be tilted backwards during the procedure. Referring to <figref>FIG. 6E</figref>, it may be preferable for the patient's head to be tilted at an angle (Î±) between 0 degrees and 90 degrees, and more preferable for the patient's head to be tilted at an angle (Î±) between 15 degrees and 75 degrees, and further preferable for the patient's head to be tilted at an angle (a) between 30 degrees and 60 degrees, and even further preferable for the patient's head to be tilted at an angle (Î±) of about 45 degrees. Tilting the patient's head during the procedure allows the medication <b>602</b> to collect above the inflatable member <b>116</b> and contact the mucosa overlaying the SPG.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">It may also be desirable to prevent the medication from being introduced or sprayed into the nasal cavity in an unknown direction. That is, it may be desirable to control the introduction of the medication into the nasal cavity such that the medication collects within the nasal cavity above the expandable member, forms a pool of medication <b>602</b>, and the level of medication raises to sphenopalatine fossa and/or the mucosa overlaying the SPG without randomly spraying the medication into the nasal cavity. Controlling the introduction of the medication in this manner increases the likelihood that that medication reaches the mucosa overlaying the SPG and the SPG itself. That is, upon exiting the flexible tubular member, the medication initially contacts the expandable member and forms a pool thereof prior to contacting any tissue within the nasal cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">Referring to <figref>FIG. 9A</figref> and <figref>FIG. 9B</figref>, there are depicted means for controlling the direction from which the medication exits the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>â² and is introduced to the nasal cavity. Referring specifically to <figref>FIG. 9A</figref>, such means may include a deflector <b>902</b> that directs the flow of medication exiting the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>â² toward the expandable member <b>116</b>. Directing the flow of medication toward the expandable member <b>116</b> reduces the likelihood that the medication will be distributed, via spraying, in an unknown direction. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 9A</figref>, the deflector <b>902</b> is coupled to the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. The deflector <b>902</b> can be located exteriorly of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>, such as in the form of a sleeve that surrounds the opening <b>160</b>, thereby forcing the outflow of medication towards the inflatable member <b>116</b>. The deflector <b>902</b> can also be integral with the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>â², such that the portion of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>â² adjacent the opening <b>160</b> directs the outflow of medication towards the inflatable member <b>116</b>. The deflector <b>902</b> may also be a separate component that is inserted at least partially within the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>â² and directs the outflow of medication towards the inflatable member <b>116</b>. Alternatively, in lieu of a deflector <b>902</b>, the means for controlling the direction from which the medication exits the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>â² and is introduced to the nasal cavity may include the opening <b>160</b> having a particular directional shape such that the shape of the opening <b>160</b> directs the outflow of medication in a direction towards the inflatable member <b>116</b>. Referring specifically to <figref>FIG. 9B</figref>, a further alternative means for controlling the direction from which the medication exits the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>â² and is introduced to the nasal cavity includes the opening <b>160</b> adjacent the expandable member <b>116</b>, wherein a deflector is omitted. The expandable member <b>116</b> may optionally have an inflated configuration such that its shape includes a narrower width (or cross sectional profile) proximal the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>â² and a wider width (or cross sectional profile) distal the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>â². This may allow the opening <b>160</b>, which is adjacent the narrower width portion of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>â² to have a perpendicular orientation within and the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>â² such that upon medication exiting the opening <b>160</b>, the medication contacts the wider width portion of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>â². And after the level of the pool of medication rises above the opening <b>160</b> distal the expandable member <b>116</b>, the additional medication exiting the opening enters directing in the pool.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">Referring to step <b>720</b> of <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, it may be preferable for the medication to remain within the nasal cavity and contact the mucosa overlaying the SPG, as well as the SPG, for a predetermined period of time (e.g., about 20 minutes), as discussed above. Referring to step <b>730</b>, upon the SPG being directly exposed to the medication for the desired period, the medication is removed from the nasal cavity by suctioning the medication through the opening <b>160</b> with an auxiliary syringe. Once the medication is removed, the expandable member <b>116</b> may be collapsed by retracting the plunger <b>164</b> of the syringe <b>112</b>, as depicted in step <b>728</b> of <figref>FIG. 7</figref>. As set forth in step <b>732</b>, after the medication is removed and the expandable member <b>116</b> is collapsed, the surgical device <b>100</b> may be removed from the nasal cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0124">The procedure discussed above with respect to <figref>FIG. 7</figref> performs a sphenopalatine ganglion block for one SPG located on one (i.e., left or right) side of the patient's head. Upon completing the sphenopalatine ganglion block for one side of the head, the same procedure can be repeated by inserting the distal end of the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> into the patient's other nostril and applying the medication to the other SPG.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">Referring to <figref>FIG. 10A</figref>, there is depicted an alternative embodiment of the surgical device <b>100</b> depicted in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>. As discussed above the surgical device <b>100</b> depicted in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref> includes expandable member <b>116</b> located at, adjacent to or toward the distal end <b>124</b> of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. As depicted in <figref>FIG. 10A</figref>, the surgical device <b>100</b>â² may include a second expandable member <b>118</b> disposed proximally of expandable member <b>116</b> and the opening <b>160</b>. Again, the expandable member <b>116</b> of the surgical device <b>100</b> allows the clinician to create a blockage within the patient's throat and fill a portion of the nasal cavity such that medication directly contacts the mucosa overlaying the SPG for a sustained period while preventing the medication from flowing down the patient's throat. The second expandable member <b>118</b> may be used to prevent the medication from exiting the patient's nostril. As depicted in <figref>FIG. 11A</figref> and <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, after introducing the surgical device <b>100</b>â² through the patient's nostril, the expandable member <b>116</b> is disposed adjacent the choana, the expandable member <b>116</b> is inflated, and medication is introduced to patient's nasal cavity through the opening <b>160</b>, and the medication collects above the expandable member <b>116</b> and adjacent the SPG. After or in conjunction with introducing the surgical device <b>100</b>â² through the patient's nostril and/or locating the expandable member <b>116</b> the choana, the second expandable member <b>118</b> is disposed adjacent the exterior of the patient's nostril or in the patient's nostril, and the second expandable member <b>118</b> is inflated. Inflating the expandable member <b>116</b> adjacent the choana and the second expandable member <b>118</b> adjacent patient's nostril allows the medication to collect between the two expandable members <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> while preventing the medication from flowing down the patient's throat and escaping through the patient's nostril, particularly if the patient moves his/her head and/or when the patient's head is not in the most desirable orientation.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0126">The second expandable member <b>118</b> may be coupled to the same inflation lumen and inflation port used to inflate expandable member <b>116</b> so that the two expandable members <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> are inflated simultaneously. Or the surgical device <b>100</b>â² may include a second inflation lumen (not shown) and/or a second inflation port (not shown) to inflate the second expandable member <b>118</b> separately from expandable member <b>116</b>. The distance from the entry of a patient's nostril to a patient's choana may vary among patients. Accordingly, it may be desirable to have a means for adjusting the distance between the two expandable members <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>. For example, it may be desirable to have a means for sliding the second expandable member <b>118</b> over the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. Sliding the second expandable member <b>118</b> over the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> relative to expandable member <b>116</b>, which may be fixed or slidable, allows a clinician to initially locate the expandable member <b>116</b> adjacent the patient's choana, then insert or place the second expandable member <b>118</b> adjacent the patient's nostril. Once the expandable members <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> are located in the desired locations, the expandable members <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> are inflated, thereby forming a snug fit in the patient's nostril and preventing medication from flowing down the patient's throat and escaping through the patient's nostril.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0127">Referring to <figref>FIG. 10B</figref>, there is depicted another alternative embodiment of the surgical device <b>100</b> depicted in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>. In comparison to the embodiment of the surgical device <b>100</b>â² illustrated in <figref>FIG. 10A</figref>, the surgical device <b>100</b>â³ illustrated in <figref>FIG. 10B</figref>, further includes a delivery device <b>117</b> between the expandable members <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> for delivering the medication. The delivery device <b>117</b> may include an expandable member having a permeable membrane or semi-permeable membrane disposed over the opening <b>160</b> such that upon expansion, pores within the permeable membrane or semi-permeable membrane increase in size and allow the medication to exit there through. Additionally, the delivery device <b>117</b> may alternatively include a sponge disposed over opening <b>160</b>. As depicted in <figref>FIG. 11B</figref>, it may be preferable to locate the surgical device of <figref>FIG. 10B</figref> in the patient's nasal cavity with the expandable member <b>116</b> disposed adjacent the choana, the delivery device <b>117</b> in the patient's nasal cavity adjacent the SPG, and the second expandable member <b>118</b> disposed adjacent and exterior of the patient's nostril. Once the delivery device <b>117</b> is located adjacent the SPG, the medication is delivered through the delivery device <b>117</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0128">For various medical and health-related purposes, there is also a potential need to insure that the surgical device is used only for treating a single patient and not used for treating multiple patients. Typically, the surgical device may be used on both sides of the patient's nasal cavity by inserting the surgical device into both nostrils of the patient, wherein the treatment of each side of the nasal cavity for the same patient may be considered a separate procedure. As discussed above, the LED is battery powered. One method of insuring that the surgical device is only used on a single patient is to preclude the use of the LED, and therefore, prevent the surgical device's ability to transilluminate through tissue after a predetermined time. Precluding the use of the LED may be assured by depleting the batteries power supply. As discussed above, a typical sphenopalatine ganglion block procedure may take between 5 minutes and 35 minutes for one side of the nasal cavity. That is, it may take between 10 minutes and 70 minutes for a clinician to complete a sphenopalatine ganglion block procedure for both sides of the patient's nasal cavity. Accordingly, if the battery power is depleted after such predetermined time, then the LED will be inoperable.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0129">In addition to insuring that the battery power is depleted after such predetermined time, it may also be desirable to prevent the LED from consuming any battery power during shipment, which would prematurely consume the limited availability of the battery's power. A potential solution for solving these two concerns is the inclusion of a pull-tab and parallel circuits within the surgical device. Referring to <figref>FIG. 17</figref>, there is depicted the proximal end of a pull tab <b>1602</b> inserted into the handle <b>1602</b> of the surgical device in an un-pulled position. Referring to <figref>FIG. 18</figref>, the distal end of the pull tab <b>1602</b> is disposed adjacent the battery terminal or between the battery terminals to interrupt and maintain an open circuit as schematically depicted in <figref>FIG. 19A</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0130">Referring to <figref>FIG. 19A</figref>, <b>19</b>B, and <b>19</b>C, there is shown a schematic diagram of a circuit <b>1900</b> in three different phases. The circuit <b>1900</b> has two potential circuit paths: one potential circuit path includes delivering power from the battery <b>1904</b> to the resister <b>1908</b>; and the other potential circuit path includes delivering power from the battery <b>1904</b> to the resister LED, which is indicated as item <b>216</b> in these figures. During shipment of the surgical device <b>100</b>, it is desirable that both circuit paths remain open. Referring to <figref>FIG. 19A</figref>, inclusion of the pull tab <b>1602</b> in an un-pulled position insures that both circuit paths will be remain open, thereby preventing the resistor <b>1908</b> and the LED <b>216</b> from drawing power from the battery. Also depicted within the circuit of <figref>FIG. 19A</figref>, the switch <b>128</b> is in an open position because it is not depressed. Referring to <figref>FIG. 19B</figref>, the switch <b>128</b> is still in an open position. The circuit path to the LED <b>216</b> is, therefore, open in both <figref>FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref>. The circuit path to the resistor <b>1908</b> is open in <figref>FIG. 19A</figref>, but the circuit path to the resistor <b>1908</b> is closed in <figref>FIG. 19B</figref> because the pull tab <b>1602</b> has been removed and illustrated in a pulled-position. Once the pull tab <b>1602</b> is removed and/or in a pulled position, the resistor <b>1908</b> begins drawing power from the battery <b>1904</b>. The power capacity of the battery <b>1904</b> and/or the size of the resistor <b>1908</b> are designed or configured to utilize all of the battery's power capacity within a predetermined time, thereby preventing a clinician from performing more than one sphenopalatine ganglion block procedure on a single patient. For example, referring to <figref>FIG. 19C</figref>, once the switch <b>128</b> is in a closed position, the circuit path to the LED <b>1816</b> is also closed. Accordingly, this figure illustrates both circuit paths in closed positionsâthe battery <b>1904</b> is delivering power to the resister <b>1808</b> and to the LED <b>1816</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0131">An alternative means of depleting the battery power in a predetermined time includes a one way switch for the LED such that LED always remains on, thereby continuously draining battery power. If this means is used, the power supply and/or resistance of the LED would be designed to deplete the battery power within a predetermined time.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0132">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref>, there is depicted a further alternative embodiment of the surgical device <b>100</b>â²â³ depicted in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>. In comparison to the embodiment of the surgical device <b>100</b> illustrated in in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the surgical device <b>100</b>â²â³ illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref> also includes a stabilizer <b>2004</b> slidably disposed over the flexible tubular member <b>108</b> between the distal end <b>144</b> of the handle <b>104</b> and the expandable member <b>116</b>. As will be discussed in more detail below, the stabilizer <b>2004</b> is able to slide over and relative to the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. For instance, <figref>FIG. 20A</figref> illustrates the stabilizer <b>2004</b> adjacent to and/or distal the distal end <b>144</b> of the handle <b>104</b> (or at and/or adjacent the proximal end of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>) and proximal the expandable member <b>116</b> (or proximal the distal end of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>). <figref>FIG. 20B</figref>, however, illustrates the stabilizer <b>2004</b> distally of the distal end <b>144</b> of the handle <b>104</b> (or distally of the proximal end of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>) and more proximal the expandable member <b>116</b> (or more proximal the distal end of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>), in comparison the position of the stabilizer <b>2004</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 20A</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0133">For example, referring to <figref>FIG. 21A</figref>, upon placing the surgical device <b>100</b>â²â³ in the nasal cavity such that the expandable member <b>116</b> is located at the desired position, namely in the nasopharynx adjacent the choana, and the expandable member <b>116</b> is expanded adjacent the choana, the location of the stabilizer <b>2004</b> is initially distal the patient's nose. Referring to <figref>FIG. 21B</figref>, after placing the surgical device <b>100</b>â²â³ in the nasal cavity and expanding the expandable member <b>116</b> adjacent the choana, the clinician may slide the stabilizer <b>2004</b> along the elongated flexible tubular member <b>108</b> such that the stabilizer <b>2004</b> contacts the patient's nose or anterior naris or is located adjacent to either the patient's nose or anterior naris. Placing the stabilizer <b>2004</b> against or adjacent the patient's nose or anterior naris assists in securing the expandable member <b>116</b> in its desired location, namely adjacent the choana in its inflated state. For example, when the expandable member <b>116</b> is disposed adjacent the choana in its inflated state, the stabilizer <b>2004</b> provides anterior traction on the seated expandable member <b>116</b> from exterior the patient's nasal cavity, nose and/or anterior naris. That is, the stabilizer <b>2004</b> aids in retaining the expandable member <b>116</b> (and/or the expandable member <b>118</b>) in position while the clinician is performing the sphenopalatine ganglion block procedure. Specifically, the stabilizer <b>2004</b> may prevent the surgical device <b>100</b>â²â³ or a portion thereof, namely the flexible tubular member <b>108</b> (or a portion thereof) and/or the expandable member <b>116</b> from moving and/or becoming unseated during inflation in the event the patient moves. For example, rapid or quick movement of the patient's head, such as movement resulting from a cough or a sneeze, may cause the expandable member <b>116</b> to also move. In the event of such movement, the seal formed by the expandable member <b>116</b> against the choana may become unseated or unstable, thereby allowing the fluid (e.g., medication) located above the expandable member <b>116</b> to leak past the expandable member <b>116</b> and into the patient's throat.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0134">Continuing to refer to <figref>FIG. 21B</figref>, the configuration of the stabilizer <b>2004</b> depicted in this figure is such that it remains completely outside the patient's nose and does not enter the patient's nostril or nasal vestibule. However, the configuration of the stabilizer could be designed to be placed partially or completely inside the patient's nostril. For example, the stabilizer could be designed such that one portion of the stabilizer is inside the patient's nostril and another portion of the stabilizer is outside the patient's nose.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0135">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 22A-22D</figref>, the stabilizer <b>2004</b> depicted in these figures is configured to remain completely outside the patient's nose without any portion thereof entering the patient's nostril or nasal vestibule. Stabilizer <b>2004</b> has a proximal portion <b>2012</b>, a distal portion <b>2008</b> and a lumen <b>2016</b> extending along the longitudinal axis of the stabilizer <b>2004</b> and through both the proximal portion <b>2012</b> and the distal portion <b>2008</b>. That is, the lumen <b>2016</b> extends from the proximal end of the proximal portion <b>2012</b> to the distal end of the distal portion <b>2008</b> of the stabilizer <b>2004</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0136">The proximal portion <b>2012</b> of the stabilizer <b>2004</b> has a smaller cross-sectional profile in comparison to the distal portion <b>2008</b>, although the relative sizes of such cross-sectional profiles may be reversed or the same. Referring to <figref>FIGS. 22B &amp; 22C</figref>, the cross-sectional profile of the distal portion <b>2008</b> may have a generally saddle shape. For example, the distal portion <b>2008</b> may have a top portion <b>2020</b>, a bottom portion <b>2024</b>, and two side portions <b>2028</b>, <b>2032</b>. And the length between the top portion <b>2020</b> and bottom portion <b>2024</b> may be less than the length between the two side portions <b>2028</b>, <b>2032</b>. Also, the top portion <b>2020</b> and bottom portion <b>2024</b> may each have a convex shape, and the two side portions <b>2028</b>, <b>2032</b> may each have concave shapes, thereby creating a saddle-shaped cross sectional profile for the distal portion <b>2008</b> of the stabilizer <b>2004</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0137">The concave shaped side portions <b>2028</b>, <b>2032</b> also create indentations that allow the clinician to easily grasp the stabilizer <b>2004</b> with his/her finger(s) and/or thumb. The stabilizer <b>2004</b> may be constructed of a flexible and/or polymeric material, such as silicone. Upon a clinician grasping the flexible stabilizer <b>2004</b> and squeezing it on the side portions <b>2028</b>, <b>2032</b>, as illustrated by the arrows depicted in <figref>FIG. 22C</figref>, the stabilizer <b>2004</b> is forced into and enters a compressed state. And when the clinician releases the stabilizer <b>2004</b>, it returns to an uncompressed state, as depicted in <figref>FIG. 22B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0138">As mentioned above, the stabilizer <b>2004</b> comprises a lumen <b>2016</b> extending along the longitudinal axis of the stabilizer <b>2004</b> and through both the proximal portion <b>2012</b> and the distal portion <b>2008</b> such that the lumen <b>2016</b> extends from the proximal end of the proximal portion <b>2012</b> to the distal end of the distal portion <b>2008</b> of the stabilizer <b>2004</b>. The cross-sectional profile of the lumen <b>2016</b> may vary or remain constant from its proximal end to its distal end. For example, the shape of the lumen at and/or towards its proximal end may be circular, while the shape of the lumen at and/or towards its distal end may be oval or vice versa. For example, <figref>FIG. 22B</figref> depicts the cross-sectional shape of the lumen <b>2016</b> as oval at the distal portion <b>2008</b> of the stabilizer <b>2004</b>, and <figref>FIG. 22C</figref> depicts the cross-sectional shape of the lumen <b>2016</b> as circular at the distal portion <b>2008</b>. Similarly, <figref>FIG. 22D</figref> depicts the cross-sectional shape of the lumen <b>2016</b> as circular at the proximal portion <b>2012</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0139">Regardless of whether the cross-sectional shape of the lumen <b>2016</b> is circular or oval, the circumference of such circle or oval is greater than the circumference of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b> extending through the lumen <b>2016</b>. The size of the circumference of the lumen <b>2016</b> being greater than the size of the circumference of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b> insures that the stabilizer <b>2004</b> can slide relative to the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. Even though the circumference of the lumen <b>2016</b> is greater that of the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>, the lumen <b>2016</b> contacts the flexible tubular member <b>108</b> in either its compressed state or its uncompressed state. For example, assuming that the cross-sectional shape of the lumen <b>2016</b> is oval at its distal end and transitions to a circular shape at its proximal end, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 22B and 22D</figref>, one or more portions of the lumen <b>2016</b> contacts one or more portions the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>, when the stabilizer <b>2004</b> is in an uncompressed state. And upon a clinician grasping the flexible stabilizer <b>2004</b> and squeezing it on the side portions <b>2028</b>, <b>2032</b>, the stabilizer <b>2004</b> is forced into and enters an compressed state, as illustrated in an <figref>FIG. 22C</figref>, such that no portion of the lumen <b>2016</b> contacts any portion the flexible tubular member <b>108</b> when the stabilizer <b>2004</b> is in a compressed state. When the stabilizer <b>2004</b> is in a compressed state, the stabilizer is able to slide over the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>, and when the stabilizer <b>2004</b> is in an uncompressed state, the stabilizer <b>2004</b> is unable to slide over the flexible tubular member <b>108</b> due to the frictionally contact between the stabilizer <b>2004</b> and the flexible tubular member <b>108</b>. Upon release of the stabilizer <b>2004</b> by the clinician, the stabilizer <b>2004</b> returns to an uncompressed state, and the shape of the lumen <b>2016</b> returns to that of the oval depicted in <figref>FIG. 22B</figref>, thereby creating contact between the stabilizer <b>2004</b> and the flexible tubular member <b>108</b> and preventing sliding of the stabilizer <b>2004</b> over the flexible tubular member <b>108</b> due to the friction between the two components.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0140">The surface of the distal end of the distal portion <b>2008</b> of the stabilizer <b>2004</b> is flat or relatively flat. The flat shape of the distal end of the distal portion <b>2008</b> insures that the stabilizer <b>2004</b> remains completely outside the patient's nose upon sliding it adjacent thereto. Also, the stabilizer <b>2004</b> may comprise a gusset <b>2006</b> that buttresses the distal portion <b>2008</b> of the stabilizer <b>2004</b>, particularly the proximal face <b>2036</b> of the distal portion <b>2008</b></p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0141">Referring to <figref>FIG. 23</figref>, there is depicted a flow chart <b>700</b>â³ representing at least some of the steps of an alternative method of performing the surgical technique of performing using the alternative embodiment of the surgical device <b>100</b>â²â³ of the present disclosure. The flow chart <b>700</b>â³ depicted in <figref>FIG. 23</figref> is similar to the flow chart depicted in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, with the exception that the flow chart <b>700</b>â³ depicted in <figref>FIG. 23</figref> also includes one or both of the following steps: step <b>715</b>, which includes sliding the stabilizer <b>2004</b> adjacent and/or against the patient's nose (after step <b>712</b> and prior to step <b>716</b>); and step <b>726</b>, which includes sliding the stabilizer <b>2004</b> away from the nose (after step <b>724</b> and prior to step <b>728</b>). Although steps <b>715</b> and <b>726</b>, as well as the other steps, are depicted in certain locations within the flowchart, these steps do not necessarily need to be performed in this particular order during the surgical procedure. For example, steps <b>715</b> and <b>726</b> may be performed prior and/or after other steps depicted within the process. Regardless of where steps <b>715</b> and <b>726</b> are performed during the sphenopalatine ganglion block procedure, utilizing the stabilizer <b>2004</b> aids in holding the expandable member <b>116</b> (and/or the expandable member <b>118</b>) in position while the clinician is performing this surgical procedure.</p>
