      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2014-043828, filed on Mar. 6, 2014, in the Japan Patent Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a graphene machining method using a gas cluster beam (GCB).</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Graphene is an aggregate of six-membered ring structures composed by carbon atoms. Since graphene has a higher-mobility, e.g., a mobility of 200,000 cm<sup>2</sup>/VÂ·s, than silicon, it has been studied to apply graphene to semiconductor devices such as high-speed switching devices or high-frequency devices. In addition, since graphene is ballistically conductive, it has been also studied to use graphene as a wiring material in semiconductor devices instead of copper (Cu).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Prior to applying graphene to semiconductor devices, it is necessary to machine graphene into a ribbon, e.g., about 10 nm in width (hereinafter referred to as âgraphene ribbonâ). Both side ends (hereinafter referred to as âedgesâ) of the machined graphene ribbon shows either armchair edges, which are a part of continuous six-membered ring structures in trans-polyacetylene illustrated in <figref>FIG. 8A</figref>, or zigzag edges which are a part of continuous six-membered ring structures in cis-polyacetylene illustrated in <figref>FIG. 8B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Electrical properties of a graphene ribbon, e.g., mobility, electrical conductivity or band gap, varies according to the shape of edges thereof. For example, a graphene ribbon having zigzag edges can be appropriately used in wirings because it shows highs mobility or electrical conductivity, and a graphene ribbon having armchair edges can be appropriately used in transistors because it creates a band gap. Therefore, when obtaining a graphene ribbon, it is important to control the edge shape of the graphene ribbon.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Lithography, e.g., reactive ion etching (RIE) using a mask, is used in conventional graphene machining. RIE uses high-energy plasma. Therefore, ions in the plasma may cleave the six-membered ring structures when they collide with the graphene so that the edges of the graphene ribbon may collapse. In order to solve this problem, it has been studied to restore the edges after obtaining a graphene ribbon through graphene machining, by performing anneal processing or plasma processing on the graphene ribbon under a reactive gas atmosphere, for example, hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) gas atmosphere, oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) gas atmosphere, ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) gas atmosphere, a hydrocarbon (C<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y</sub>) gas atmosphere or the like, such that functional groups are combined to the cleaved six-membered ring structures. However, it is difficult to completely restore the edges by only combining the functional groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Therefore, it has been also studied to apply gas cluster ion beam (GCIB), which uses clusters of relatively low-energy gas molecules, to graphene machining. In particular, the present inventors suggested a method wherein graphene is machined using GCIB of water molecules to selectively obtain chemically-stable armchair edges by a synergy effect with low-oxidizing power of water molecules.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">However, in GCIB, gas molecules or clusters of a plurality of gas molecules are ionized, or electric charges are attached to the gas molecules or the clusters. For these reasons, the electric charges may remain in the graphene ribbon machined using GCIB, and it is likely that the remaining electric charges affect electrical characteristics of a semiconductor device to which the graphene ribbon is applied.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The present disclosure provides a graphene machining method capable of preventing graphene edges from collapsing while preventing electric charges from remaining in a graphene ribbon.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a graphene machining method including irradiating a GCB (Gas Cluster Beam) onto graphene.</p>

      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the GCB irradiation device <b>10</b> includes a chamber <b>11</b> constituted by a cylindrical vacuum container, a rotation stage <b>12</b> arranged in a bottom portion of the chamber <b>11</b>, and a GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> arranged within the chamber <b>11</b> to face the rotation stage <b>12</b>. Unlike the conventional etching or GCIB irradiation devices, the GCB irradiation device <b>10</b> does not need to have a plasma generation mechanism or electron beam ionization unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">A loading/unloading gate <b>14</b> for loading/unloading a substrate S having a front surface where the graphene is formed is arranged in a portion of a side surface of the chamber <b>11</b>. A gate valve <b>15</b> for opening/closing the loading/unloading gate <b>14</b> is installed in the loading/unloading gate <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">An exhaust port <b>16</b> is arranged in another portion of the side surface of the chamber <b>11</b>, and an exhaust passage <b>17</b> is connected to the exhaust port <b>16</b>. The exhaust passage <b>17</b> is connected to a vacuum pump <b>20</b> constituted by, e.g., a turbo molecule pump, through a pressure adjustment valve <b>18</b> and an opening/closing valve <b>19</b>. The vacuum pump <b>20</b> depressurizes the inside of the chamber <b>11</b> through the exhaust passage <b>17</b>, and the pressure adjustment valve <b>18</b> sets the internal pressure of the chamber <b>11</b> to be a desired vacuum level, e.g., 10<sup>â4 </sup>Pa.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The rotation stage <b>12</b> holds the substrate S, and is connected to a driving part <b>22</b> via a rotation axis <b>21</b>. The driving part <b>22</b> applies a rotation driving force to the rotation axis <b>21</b>. The rotation stage <b>12</b> is configured to rotate around the rotation axis <b>21</b> or move in a vertical direction in the figures by the driving part <b>22</b>. The rotation stage <b>12</b> adsorbs the substrate S through an electrostatic chuck mechanism or a vacuum adsorption mechanism (both not shown).</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> is held by a nozzle moving part <b>23</b> that includes a revolving axis <b>23</b><i>a </i>installed beside the rotation stage <b>12</b> and a revolving arm <b>23</b><i>b </i>extending from the upper end of the revolving axis <b>23</b><i>a </i>in a direction toward the rotation stage <b>12</b>. The revolving axis <b>23</b><i>a </i>penetrates the bottom portion of the chamber <b>11</b> and is engaged with a rotary mechanism <b>24</b> outside of the chamber <b>11</b>. The rotary mechanism <b>24</b> rotates the revolving axis <b>23</b><i>a </i>so that the GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> makes revolving movement around the revolving axis <b>23</b><i>a</i>. As a result, the GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> advances toward and retreats from above the substrate S held on the rotation stage <b>12</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is a vertical sectional view schematically illustrating a configuration of the GCB irradiation nozzle illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> includes a substantially cylindrical pressure vessel <b>26</b> having an open lower end portion to form an orifice <b>25</b>, and a cone-shaped gas diffusion part <b>27</b> having a downwardly increasing diameter. The gas diffusion part <b>27</b> is formed in the lower end of the pressure vessel <b>26</b> and communicates with the inside of the pressure vessel <b>26</b> through the orifice <b>25</b>. The opening diameter of the orifice <b>25</b> is, e.g., 0.1 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> discharges gas molecules <b>28</b> from the pressure vessel <b>26</b>, which has an inner pressure higher than that of the chamber <b>11</b>, toward the substrate S. That is to say, the gas molecules <b>28</b> are introduced into the chamber <b>11</b>. At this time, since the diameter of the gas diffusion part <b>27</b> is downwardly increasing, the discharged gas molecules <b>28</b> are rapidly cooled by adiabatic expansion, which decreases kinetic energy of the respective gas molecules <b>28</b>. Accordingly, the gas molecules <b>28</b> make close contact with each other by an intermolecular force applied among the gas molecules <b>28</b>, i.e., by the van der Walls force. As a result, a plurality of gas clusters <b>29</b> made of two or more gas molecules <b>28</b> is formed. The formed gas clusters <b>29</b> directly move toward the substrate S and collide with the substrate S. In other words, a GCB made of a plurality of gas clusters <b>29</b> is irradiated onto the substrate S.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In the GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b>, the form of the gas clusters <b>29</b> depends on the opening diameter of the orifice <b>25</b> or the shape of the gas diffusion part <b>27</b>. Since the gas clusters <b>29</b> may be decomposed if the temperature increases, the pressure vessel <b>26</b> may be cooled down when irradiating the gas clusters <b>29</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> is configured to vertically irradiate the GCB onto the surface of the substrate S. In this embodiment, âverticalâ means a state that an angle Î¸ between the substrate S and the center axis of the pressure vessel <b>26</b> is in a range of 90Â°Â±15Â° in the drawing.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In the GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b>, a pipe <b>30</b> is connected to the upper end portion of the pressure vessel <b>26</b>. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the pipe <b>30</b> penetrates the inside of the revolving arm <b>23</b><i>b </i>and the revolving axis <b>23</b><i>a</i>, and is connected to a gas supply passage <b>32</b> through a connector <b>31</b> outside of the chamber <b>11</b>. The gas supply passage <b>32</b> branches at a branch point <b>35</b> into a first gas supply passage <b>33</b> and a second gas supply passage <b>34</b>. A pressure adjustment valve <b>36</b> is arranged between the connector <b>31</b> and the branch point <b>35</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">A carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) gas supply source <b>38</b> is connected to the first gas supply passage <b>33</b> through an opening/closing valve V<b>1</b> and a flow rate controller <b>37</b>. A helium (He) gas supply source <b>40</b> is connected to the second gas supply passage <b>34</b> through an opening/closing valve V<b>2</b> and a flow rate controller <b>39</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">A pressure detector <b>41</b> is arranged in the gas supply passage <b>32</b>. Based on a detection value of the pressure detector <b>41</b>, the opening degree of the pressure adjustment valve <b>36</b> is controlled by a controller <b>42</b> to be described later, and thus the internal pressure of the pressure vessel <b>26</b> of the GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> is controlled. Instead of installing the pressure detector <b>41</b> in the gas supply passage <b>32</b>, a pressure detector may be installed in the pressure vessel <b>26</b> so that the internal pressure of the pressure vessel <b>26</b> may be controlled based on a detection value of the pressure detector.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">In the GCB irradiation device <b>10</b>, a GCB is irradiated onto the entire surface of the substrate S by the revolving movement of the GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> and the rotation of the rotation stage <b>12</b>. The revolving movement of the GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b>, the rotation of the rotation stage <b>12</b> or the like in the GCB irradiation device <b>10</b> is controlled by the controller <b>42</b> included in the GCB irradiation device <b>10</b>. The controller <b>42</b> is configured by, for example, a computer, and has a memory for storing programs, a RAM as a program expansion area and a CPU. The CPU executes the programs expanded in the RAM, whereby the graphene machining method according to the present embodiment is performed.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Hereinafter, experimental results will be described according to the present disclosure. The present inventors prepared a semiconductor wafer W (hereinafter, simply referred to as âwaferâ) having a front surface where a single layer of graphene <b>43</b> is formed, and irradiated a GCB <b>44</b>, which is generated from a mixture gas of carbon dioxide gas and helium gas (hereinafter, simply referred to as âmixture gasâ), from the GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> onto the wafer W. At this time, the graphene <b>43</b> was scanned by the GCB <b>44</b> in one direction so that a part of the graphene <b>43</b> was removed in a band shape as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. Thereafter, the surface property of the wafer W was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is a partially cut-off view of the wafer W.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In the mixture gas for generating the GCB <b>44</b>, a flow rate ratio of carbon dioxide gas to helium gas was set to be 1:9. The pressure of the mixture gas in the pressure vessel <b>26</b> of the GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> was set to be 4 MPa.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is a partial plan view illustrating a wafer in which graphene is partially removed by the GCB irradiation. <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is also a partially cut-off view of the wafer W.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the left half of the graphene <b>43</b> in the drawing is removed and a base <b>45</b>, e.g., made of silicon, of the wafer W is exposed. An edge <b>46</b> of the graphene <b>43</b> is provided at the boundary between the graphene <b>43</b> and the exposed base <b>45</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a graph illustrating a surface property of the wafer which has a graphene removed portion as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref> wherein the surface property is analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. In <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the horizontal axis is a wavenumber (the reciprocal of a wavelength) of a light scattered from the surface of the wafer W, and the vertical axis is the intensity of the scattered light. Reference symbols (<b>1</b>) to (<b>4</b>) in <figref>FIG. 6</figref> correspond to positions (<b>1</b>) to (<b>4</b>) in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, respectively. The unit of the wavenumber is cm<sup>â1 </sup>and the unit of the intensity of the scattered light is an arbitrary unit (a.u.).</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Ordinarily, light scattered from the graphene has a peak due to vibration in the six-membered ring structure (the hexagonal lattice) of carbon atoms. The peak is called as the G band with a wavenumber near 1590 cm<sup>â1</sup>. On the other hand, light scattered from armchair edges or from residues or damages of the graphene <b>43</b>, where a large number of dangling bonds exist, has a peak due to carbon atoms having dangling bonds, which is called the D band with a wavenumber near 1350 cm<sup>â1</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, in the position (<b>3</b>), the G band was remarkably generated and the graphene <b>43</b> remained without being removed. In the position (<b>2</b>), the G band was hardly produced and the graphene <b>43</b> was removed. From these, it can be known that the graphene <b>43</b> was cut out to clearly form the edge <b>46</b> between the positions (<b>3</b>) and (<b>2</b>). In other words, it can be known that the edge <b>46</b> can be clearly formed by irradiating the GCB <b>44</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Further, from the fact that the G band was hardly generated in the position (<b>2</b>), it can be known that the graphene <b>43</b> was removed. Furthermore, from the fact that the D band was remarkably generated, it can be known that the armchair edge was formed as the edge <b>46</b> near the position (<b>2</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The present inventors guess the reason why the armchair edge was formed as the edge <b>46</b> by irradiating the GCB <b>44</b> generated from the mixture gas, as follows. Kinetic energy of gas clusters relates to mass and velocity of the gas clusters. In a case of ionizing gas clusters, the mass of the gas clusters can be measured using the time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In the present embodiment, the mass of the gas clusters was measured by an additional measuring device, which will not be described herein. The velocity of the gas clusters can also be controlled by adjusting a thermal motion speed of the gas clusters, which is a temperature-dependent parameter, and a discharge speed of the gas clusters depending on a pressure of a GCB irradiation nozzle. Accordingly, every gas cluster can be set to have an energy ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 eV, or equal to or higher than 0.5 eV. With regard to the graphene ribbon, the armchair edge is more chemically-stable than the zigzag edge and can maintain the edge shape with lower energy than the zigzag edge. Since the cluster energy of gas molecules (gas molecules of carbon dioxide or helium) of the GCB <b>44</b> produced from the mixture gas is low, i.e., about 0.3 to 0.5 eV/cluster, the energy forced to the graphene <b>43</b> by the cluster is low. As a result, it is thought that the armchair edge, which needs low-energy for maintaining its shape during machining of the graphene <b>43</b>, was selectively formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Considering the aforementioned reasons, it is also thought that if the cluster energy of the gas molecules of the GCB is slightly higher, e.g., equal to or higher than 0.5 eV/cluster, the zigzag edge, which needs slightly higher energy for maintaining its shape, may be formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In addition, from the fact that the G band was not generated in the position (<b>1</b>), it can be known that the graphene <b>43</b> was completely removed, and from the fact that the D band was not generated, it can be known that the residue of the graphene <b>43</b> did not exist in the position (<b>1</b>). On the other hand, from the fact that the G band is remarkably produced in the position (<b>4</b>), it can be known that the graphene <b>43</b> remained without being removed. Moreover, from the fact that the D band was hardly generated in the positions (<b>3</b>) and (<b>4</b>), it can be known that the remaining graphene <b>43</b> was not damaged.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The present disclosure is based on the above-described experimental result.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">
        <figref>FIGS. 7A to 7C</figref> are process diagrams illustrating the graphene machining method according to the present embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">First, a wafer W having a front surface where a single layer of graphene <b>43</b> is formed is prepared, and the wafer W is adsorbed on the rotation stage <b>12</b> in the GCB irradiation device <b>10</b> (see <figref>FIG. 7A</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Subsequently, the internal pressure of the chamber <b>11</b> is decreased to be, e.g., 10<sup>â4 </sup>Pa, and the GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> is advanced, by the nozzle moving part <b>23</b>, over the wafer W adsorbed on the rotation stage <b>12</b> so that the GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> is arranged to face a desired machining position in the wafer W. Then, the internal pressure of the pressure vessel <b>26</b> is set to be 4 MPa, and a plurality of the gas clusters <b>29</b> is formed by discharging a predetermined gas from the pressure vessel <b>26</b> into the chamber <b>11</b>. The GCB <b>44</b> configured by the gas clusters <b>29</b> is irradiated onto the graphene <b>43</b> of the wafer W while moving the GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> relative to the wafer W (see <figref>FIG. 7B</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The GCB <b>44</b> removes the graphene <b>43</b> in a desired machining position by collision of the gas clusters <b>29</b>, thereby forming the edge <b>46</b> (see <figref>FIG. 7C</figref>). At this time, the energy of the gas molecule clusters in the GCB <b>44</b> is controlled. For example, if the energy of the gas molecule clusters is low, e.g., 0.3 to 0.5 eV/cluster, an armchair edge is formed as the edge <b>46</b>. If the energy of the gas molecule clusters is slightly high, e.g., equal to or higher than 0.5 eV/cluster, a zigzag edge is formed as the edge <b>46</b>. The control of the energy of the gas molecule clusters can be performed: by changing an average molecular weight of the gas molecules by changing gas species, changing a combination of gas species in a mixture gas, changing a flow rate ratio of the gas species, or the like; or by changing a gas introduction pressure by changing the internal pressure of the pressure vessel <b>26</b> of the GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> during a gas discharge.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">After the edge <b>46</b> is formed by removing the graphene <b>43</b> from the desired machining position, and the method according to the present embodiment is completed.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">According to the graphene machining method of <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the GCB <b>44</b> is irradiated onto the graphene <b>43</b> in the wafer W. The GCB <b>44</b> is a beam of the gas clusters <b>29</b> constituted by a plurality of gas molecules or a plurality of gas atoms. However, in the GCB <b>44</b>, the gas clusters <b>29</b> are not ionized and no electric charge is attached thereto. Since the gas clusters <b>29</b> of the GCB <b>44</b> are much heavier than normal gas molecules or the like, the graphene <b>43</b> can be machined into a graphene ribbon by impact at collision. Even though the mass of the gas clusters <b>29</b> of the GCB <b>44</b> is the same level of the mass of the clusters of the conventional GCIB for example, since no electric charge is attached to the gas clusters <b>29</b> of the GCB <b>44</b>, an effect in which no electric charge remains in the graphene ribbon can be obtained. Moreover, since the kinetic energy of the gas clusters <b>29</b> is the main energy of the GCB <b>44</b>, as the kinetic energy of each gas molecule or the like introduced from the GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> increases, the energy of the GCB <b>44</b> also increases.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In the present embodiment, by discharging a predetermined gas from the GCB irradiation nozzle <b>13</b> to the chamber <b>11</b> with a pressure difference larger than atmospheric pressure, the gas is introduced rapidly and the degree of adiabatic expansion of the discharged gas becomes high. From this, the kinetic energy of each gas molecule which forms the gas clusters <b>29</b> of the GCB <b>44</b> can be increased and the mass of the formed clusters can be further increased. Therefore, the graphene can be certainly machined.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">That is to say, similarly to the gas clusters of the GCIB, the kinetic energy of the gas clusters <b>29</b> of the GCB <b>44</b> can be set to be higher than the kinetic energy of gas molecules or the like that make free motion. As a result, the graphene can be certainly machined. In addition, unlike gas molecule ions or cluster ions of GCIB, no electric charge is attached to the gas molecules of the gas clusters <b>29</b> of the GCB <b>44</b>, whereby it is possible to machine the graphene <b>43</b> while preventing electric charges from remaining on the graphene ribbon when irradiating the GCB <b>44</b> onto the graphene <b>43</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Moreover, since the gas clusters <b>29</b> of the GCB <b>44</b> are not subjected to ion acceleration, the energy of the gas clusters <b>29</b> is not unnecessarily increased. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the edge of the graphene <b>43</b> from collapsing with which the gas clusters <b>29</b> collide. Moreover, the energy of the GCB <b>44</b> can be controlled by the gas introduction pressure, gas species or a combination of gas species in the mixture gas, a flow rate ratio of the gas species, or the like. Accordingly, by controlling those parameters, the graphene <b>43</b> can be machined while preventing collapse of the edge of the graphene <b>43</b>, and further the edge shape of the graphene <b>43</b> can be controlled.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">In the aforementioned method illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 7A to 7C</figref>, the cluster energy of the gas molecules in the GCB <b>44</b> is controlled. In the graphene ribbon, the armchair edge is more chemically-stable than the zigzag edge and can maintain the edge shape with lower energy than the zigzag edge. Therefore, the shape of the edge <b>46</b>, i.e., the armchair edge or the zigzag edge, of the graphene ribbon obtained by machining using the GCB <b>44</b> can be controlled by controlling the cluster energy of the gas molecules of the GCB <b>44</b> to thereby control the energy forced on the graphene <b>43</b>. That is to say, in the aforementioned graphene machining method illustrated in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, by irradiating the GCB <b>44</b> onto the graphene <b>43</b>, machining of the graphene <b>43</b> and controlling of the shape of the edge <b>46</b> can be simultaneously performed.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Moreover, in the aforementioned graphene machining method illustrated in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, it is not necessary to ionize the gas molecules. Thus, unlike the conventional etching or GCIB irradiation devices, the GCB irradiation device <b>10</b> does not need to have a plasma generation mechanism or electron beam ionization unit, whereby the configuration of the GCB irradiation device <b>10</b> can be simplified.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Although the present disclosure has been described with the above embodiment, the present disclosure is not limited to the above embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">For example, in some embodiments, the gas for generating the GCB <b>44</b> may be a gas that becomes inactive under room temperature. By doing this, in the machining using the GCB <b>44</b>, the chemical reaction caused by the gas molecules contained in the gas can be suppressed, whereby it is possible to prevent the six-membered ring structures of carbon in the graphene <b>43</b> from being combined with functional groups by the chemical reaction. Moreover, in this case, since a mask film that covers the graphene <b>43</b> in order to prevent the remaining graphene <b>43</b> from participating in a chemical reaction is unnecessary, it can be suppressed that resist materials forming the mask film form an impurity state in the graphene ribbon. Further, since ashing of the mask film is unnecessary, it is possible to prevent the graphene ribbon from being damaged by excessive ashing.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">In addition to the mixture gas of carbon dioxide gas and helium gas used in the aforementioned embodiment, tetrafluoromethane (CF<sub>4</sub>) gas, sulfer hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) gas or the like may be used as the gas that becomes inactive under room temperature. Further, tetrafluoromethane gas or sulfer hexafluoride gas may be used as a single gas without being mixed with helium gas.</p>

      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Any type of storage medium that can store the program codes, such as a RAM, an NVRAM, a floppy disk (registered trademark), a hard disk, a magneto-optical disk, an optical disk (e.g., a CD-ROM, a CD-R, a CD-RW, a DVD (a DVD-ROM, a DVD-RAM, a DVD-RW, or a DVD+RW)), a magnetic tape, a non-volatile memory card, a ROM and so forth, may be used as the storage medium for providing the program codes. Alternatively, the program codes may be provided to the controller <b>42</b> through a download from other computers or database (not shown) connected to the Internet, a commercial network, or a local area network.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The functions described in the above-mentioned embodiment can be implemented not only by reading and executing the program codes by the controller <b>42</b>, but also by allowing an OS (Operating System) running in the CPU to execute all or a part of practical processes based on instructions from the program codes.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">The functions described in the aforementioned embodiment can also be implemented by recording the program codes, which are read from the storage medium, on a memory in a function extension board inserted in the controller <b>42</b> or a function extension unit connected to the controller <b>42</b> and then by allowing a CPU in the function extension board or in the function extension unit to execute all or a part of practical processes based on instructions from the program codes.</p>

      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">According to the graphene machining method of the present disclosure, a GCB is irradiated onto graphene. The GCB is a beam constituted by clusters of a plurality of gas molecules or a plurality of gas atoms. However, the clusters in the GCB are not ionized and no electric charge is attached to the clusters. Since the mass of the clusters of the GCB is much heavier than the mass of ordinary gas molecules or the like, the graphene can be machined into a graphene ribbon by impact at collision. Further, since no electric charge is attached to the clusters, it is possible to machine the graphene without remaining electric charges on the graphene ribbon. Moreover, since the clusters in the GCB are not ionized, the clusters are not subjected to ion acceleration, whereby the cluster energy is not unnecessarily increased. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the graphene edge from collapsing with which the gas clusters collide. The energy of the GCB can be controlled by a gas introduction pressure, gas species or a combination of gas species in a mixture gas, a flow rate ratio of the gas species, or the like. By controlling these parameters, the graphene can be machined while preventing the graphene edge from collapsing, and further the edge shape of the graphene can be controlled.</p>
