      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a novel uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glycosyltransferase, and particularly to a novel UDP-glycosyltransferase derived from <i>ginseng </i>and use thereof, a method for preparing glycosylated ginsenoside by converting protopanaxadiol (PPD)-type ginsenoside using the UDP-glycosyltransferase, a composition for converting the PPD-type ginsenoside into glycosylated ginsenoside, comprising the UDP-glycosyltransferase, a transformant or a culture thereof as active ingredients, a method for enhancing the expression of the UDP-glycosyltransferase using MeJA (methyl jasmonate), and a composition for enhancing the expression of the UDP-glycosyltransferase, which comprises MeJA as an active ingredient.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">
        <i>Ginseng </i>(<i>Panax ginseng </i>C. A meyer) is one of the most popular medicinal herbs widely used for improving health. The root of <i>ginseng </i>was consumed as a herbal tea in a traditional medicine, and currently it has been included in a variety of products including candy, instant tea, and tonic drink. Ginsenosides which are glycosylated triterpenes contained in <i>ginseng </i>have positive effects on health. In particular, ginsenosides have been known to have various pharmacological effects such as immune system enhancement and revitalization of body functions. Also more than 40 different ginsenosides have been identified in the root of <i>ginseng</i>. However, since mass production of each of the ginsenosides is hard, it remains as a major obstacle for investigating efficacy of certain ginsenoside, for example, its therapeutic effects on specific diseases.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Ginsenosides are glycosylated dammarene-type tetracyclic triterpenes, and can be classified into three different groups based on their aglycone structure: Protopanaxadiol (PPD)-type ginsenosides, Protopanaxatriol (PPT)-type ginsenosides, and Oleanolic acid-type ginsenosides. These three groups can be further classified based on the position and number of sugar moieties (aglycones) attached to the C-3, C-6, and C-20 positions of the rings by a glycosidic bond in the chemical structure. PPD and PPT also possess different hydroxylation patterns. PPD possesses âOH groups at the C-3, C-12, and C-20 positions, whereas PPT possesses âOH groups at the C-3, C-6, C-12, and C-20 positions. PPD and PPT can be glycosylated with glucose and/or other types of sugars to be converted into various ginsenosides. The representative PPD-type ginsenosides include ginsenoside Rh2, ginsenoside Rg3, Compound K (C-K), ginsenoside F2, and ginsenoside Rd. And the representative PPT-type ginsenosides include ginsenoside F1, Rg1, Re, Rh1, and Rg2.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The biosynthetic pathway of ginsenosides is only partially identified. The ginsenoside biosynthesis is known to share the biosynthetic pathways with other triterpenes until oxidosqualene is synthesized by a series of condensation reactions of isopentenyl diphosphate and DMADP (dimethylallyl diphosphate) by the action of IPP isomerase (IPI), GPP synthase (GPS), FPP synthase (FPS), squalene synthase (SS) and squalene epoxidase (SE) (Ajikumar et al. Science, 330, 70-74. 2010; Ro et al. Nature, 440, 940-943. 2006; Sun et al. BMC genomics, 11, 262, 2010). Oxidosqualene is cyclized into dammarenediol-II by DS (dammarenediol-II synthase) which is a triterpene cyclase. Dammarenediol-II has hydroxyl groups at the C-3 and C-20 positions, and is converted into PPD by hydroxylation of the C-12 position by a p450 enzyme, PPDS (protopanaxadiol synthase). PPDS can be also converted into PPT by hydroxylation at the C-6 position by another p450 enzyme, PPTS (protopanaxatriol synthase). PPD can be converted into PPD-type ginsenoside by glycosylation at the C-3 and/or C-20 position(s), and PPT can be converted into PPT-type ginsenoside by glycosylation at the C-6 and/or C-20 position(s). UDP (Uridine diphosphate)-glycosyltransferase (UGT) is considered to be involved in synthetic pathways of various ginsenosides by formation of O-, Î²1,2-, or Î²1,6-glycosidic linkage. DS, PPDS and PPTS have been reported as the enzymes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis, but it has not been identified whether UGT is involved in the biosynthesis of ginsenosides.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">UDP-glycosyltransferase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a sugar moiety from UDP-sugar to a wide range of metabolites such as hormones and secondary metabolites. Generally, UGT acts in the final step of biosynthetic pathway in order to increase solubility, stability, storage, bioactivity, or biological availability of metabolites. As recognized by a remarkable diversity of metabolites in plants, the genome of a plant possesses hundreds of different UGTs. For example, a plant model, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana </i>contains 107 UGTs that belong to 14 different groups (Group A to Group N) based on the amino acid sequence. Different UGTs show substrate specificity towards both sugar donor and sugar acceptor. For example, UGT78D2 transfers glucose from UDP-glucose to the C-3 position of flavonol (kaempferol, quercetin) and anthocyanin (cyanidin) in order to produce flavonol 3-O-glucosides and cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, respectively. It seems that such glycosylation is essential for in vivo stability and storage of the compound. On the other hand, UGT89C1 transfers rhanmnose from UDP-rhanmnose to the C-7 position of flavonol-3-O-glucosides in order to produce flavonol-3-O-glucoside-7-O-rhamnoside. Likewise, UGT89C1 does not utilize UDP-glucose and anthocyanin-3-O-glucoside as a substrate. And it has different specificity towards UDP-sugar and acceptor from that of UGT78D2. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the substrate specificity for different types of UGTs.</p>

      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">As one aspect, the present invention provides a novel uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glycosyltransferase (UGT) derived from <i>ginseng. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">As used herein, the term âuridine diphosphate (UDP)-glycosyltransferaseâ is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a monosaccharide moiety from a glycosyl donor to a glycosyl acceptor molecule, and in particular, it refers to an enzyme that utilizes UDP-sugar as the glycosyl donor. In the present invention, the UDP-glycosyltransferase may be interchangeably used with UGT. It is thought that the UDP-glycosyltransferase catalyzes various glycosylations of protopanaxadiol (PPD) and protopanaxatriol (PPT) to generate a wide range of ginsenosides. However, even those enzymes with have the UDP-glycosyltransferase activity have different substrate specificity and regioselectivity depending on the type of the enzyme. Therefore, it needs to be determined whether the enzyme is a UDP-glycosyltransferase specifically acting on ginsenoside which is a <i>ginseng </i>saponin. There has been no report on UDP-glycosyltransferase derived from <i>ginseng</i>, which specifically acts at the C-3 position of the PPD-type ginsenoside and transfers a sugar moiety in order to produce ginsenoside Rh2 or F2 from PPD or Compound K (C-K). The UDP-glycosyltransferase was identified for the first time by the present inventors.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">For the purpose of the present invention, the UDP-glycosyltransferase may be an UDP-glycosyltransferase derived from <i>ginseng</i>, preferably a UDP-glycosyltransferase derived from <i>Panax ginseng</i>, and more preferably a UDP-glycosyltransferase represented by the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1, but is not limited thereto. In one example of the present invention, the UDP-glycosyltransferase represented by the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is designated as PgUGT74A1.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The UDP-glycosyltransferase may refer to the proteins possessing the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO.1, but also an amino acid sequence having a sequence homology of 70% or higher, preferably 80% or higher, more preferably 90% or higher, even more preferably 95% or higher, even much more preferably 98% or higher, and most preferably 99% or higher to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1. However, any protein can be used without limitation, as long as it has the UDP-glycosyltransferase activity being capable of substantially transferring a sugar to <i>ginseng </i>ginsenoside. In addition, if the protein with the above sequence homology has substantially the same or corresponding bioactivity as UDP-glycosyltransferase even the variants of the protein having a portion of amino acid sequence deleted, modified, substituted, or added may be included in the scope of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">As used herein, the term âhomologyâ is intended to indicate the degree of similarity to the amino acid sequence of a wild type protein or a nucleotide sequence that encodes the same, and includes sequences having homology of the above percentage or higher with the amino acid sequence or base sequence of the present invention. Homology comparisons can be conducted by sight or by readily available sequence comparison programs.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Preferably, the UDP-glycosyltransferase of the present invention refers to a protein having an activity of converting a PPD-type ginsenoside into a glycosylated ginsenoside, but is not limited thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">As used herein, the term âPPD-type ginsenosideâ is a dammarane-type saponin, and it means a ginsenoside having two hydroxyl groups (âOH) at its non-sugar component (aglycone), and examples thereof include PPD (protopanaxadiol), Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rc, Rd, Ra3, Rg3, Rh2, Rs1, CâO, CâY, C-Mc1, C-Mc, F2, C-K, Gypenoside XVII, Gypenoside LXXV, and Rs2. For the purpose of the present invention, the PPD-type ginsenoside may be any ginsenoside without limitation, as long as it is a ginsenoside that can be glycosylated by the UDP-glycosyltransferase of the present invention. It may be preferably a ginsenoside to be O-glycosylated, more preferably a ginsenoside to be glycosylated at its C-3 position, and much more preferably PPD or C-K, but is not limited thereto. In one example of the present invention, PPD and Compound K were used as the PPD-type ginsenoside that can be glycosylated by the UDP-glycosyltransferase of the present invention, PgUGT74A1. A schematic diagram for the structure of the ginsenoside is shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">As used herein, the term âglycosylated ginsenosideâ means a ginsenoside having a monosaccharide or larger saccharide molecule attached to the hydroxyl group of the non-sugar component (aglycone) that constitutes the ginsenoside, and exemplified by ginsenoside Rh2, Rg3, F2 or Rd, but is not limited thereto. For the purpose of the present invention, the glycosylated ginsenoside includes any glycosylated ginsenoside without limitation, as long as it is a ginsenoside glycosylated by the UDP-glycosyltransferase of the present invention. The glycosylated ginsenoside preferably means a ginsenoside having an O-glycosidic bond, and more preferably a ginsenoside having a sugar of monosaccharide or higher saccharide at its C-3 position, but is not limited thereto. In one example of the present invention, PPD and Compound K (C-K) were converted into glycosylated ginsenosides, ginsenoside Rh2 and F2 by the activity of PgUGT74A1, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In particular, the UDP-glycosyltransferase of SEQ ID NO. 1 in the present invention transfers a glucose from UDP-glucose to the hydroxyl group (âOH) at the C-3 position of PPD-type ginsenoside forming an O-glycosidic bond, thereby producing glycosylated ginsenoside.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Specifically, the UDP-glycosyltransferase transfers the glucose moiety from UDP-glucose to the hydroxyl group at the C-3 position of PPD to form the O-glycosidic bond, thereby converting PPD into ginsenoside Rh2. The UDP-glycosyltransferase transfers the glucose moiety from UDP-glucose to the hydroxyl group at the C-3 position of C-K forming the O-glycosidic bond, thereby converting C-K into ginsenoside F2. On the other hand, the UDP-glycosyltransferase does not act on the hydroxyl group at the C-12 or C-20 position of PPD-type ginsenoside, but specifically transfers a sugar to the hydroxyl group at the C-3 position. In addition, even though PPT-type ginsenoside has the hydroxyl group at the C-3 position, the UDP-glycosyltransferase of the present invention does not act on the PPT-type ginsenoside. Therefore, since the UDP-glycosyltransferase of the present invention has a substrate specificity and regioselectivity for PPD-type ginsenosides, particularly the hydroxyl group at the C-3 position of PPD and C-K, it can be used for conversion of a particular ginsenoside, preferably conversion of PPD and C-K into Rh2 and F2 respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In one example of the present invention, the novel UDP-glycosyltransferase, PgUGT74A1 was newly isolated from <i>ginseng </i>(Example 1), and the result of the sequence analysis showed that the glycosyltransferase was clustered in the UGT74 family, but was not clustered in the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana </i>UGT74 subfamily (Experimental Example 1 and <figref>FIG. 2</figref>). In addition, the glycosyltransferase regioselectively acts on PPD-type ginsenosides and transfers one glucose to the hydroxyl group at the C-3 position, thereby producing glycosylated ginsenosides (Experimental Examples 2 and 4; and <figref>FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>). The enzymatic activity of PgUGT74A1 protein is shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">As another aspect, the present invention provides a polynucleotide encoding the UDP-glycosyltransferase, an expression vector comprising the polynucleotide, and a transformant comprising the expression vector therein.</p>

      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The expression vector comprising the polynucleotide provided in the present invention includes, but is not limited to, <i>E. coli</i>-derived plasmids (pYG601BR322, pBR325, pUC118 and pUC119), <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>-derived plasmids (pUB110 and pTP5), yeast-derived plasmids (YEp13, YEp24 and YCp50) and Ti-plasmids used in <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation.

Further, an animal virus such as retrovirus, adenovirus or vaccinia virus, an insect virus such as baculovirus, a double-stranded plant virus (e.g., CaMV), a single-stranded virus, or a viral vector originated from Geminivirus may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Moreover, as the vector of the present invention, a transcriptional activator, such as B42-linked fusion plasmid (e.g., pJG4-5), may be used. In order to facilitate purification of the target protein obtained in the present invention, the plasmid vector may further include other sequences, if necessary. The fusion plasmid may include a tag such as GST, GFP, His-tag, Myc-tag or the like, but the fusion plasmid of the present invention is not limited to these examples. In one example of the present invention, pGEX4T-1 which is a GST gene-fused vector was used for construction of the expression vector that comprises the UDP-glycosyltransferase-encoding polynucleotide.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In addition, the fusion protein expressed by the vector comprising the fusion sequence may be purified by affinity chromatography. For example, if a glutathione-S-transferase is to be fused with other sequence, glutathione which is a substrate of the enzyme can be used. If hexa-histidine is used as a tag to the target protein, the target protein can be easily purified by using a Ni-NTA His-bind resin column (Novagen, USA).</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">For insertion of the polynucleotide of the present invention into the vector, the purified DNA may be cleaved using appropriate restriction enzymes, and inserted into the restriction sites or cloning site of a suitable vector DNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The polynucleotide encoding the UDP-glycosyltransferase of the present invention may be operably linked to a vector. The vector of the present invention may further include cis elements such as an enhancer, a splicing signal, a poly A addition signal, a selection marker, a ribosome binding sequence (SD sequence), in addition to a promoter and the nucleic acid of the present invention. As examples of the selection marker, chloramphenicol resistance gene, ampicillin resistance gene, dihydrofolate reductase, neomycin resistance gene or the like can be used, but the type of additional elements to be operably linked is not limited to these examples.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As used herein, the term âtransformationâ means an introduction of DNA into a host cell such that the DNA can be replicated as an extra-chromosomal element or by chromosomal integration. That is, transformation refers to synthetic alteration of genes by introducing a foreign DNA into the cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The transformation of the present invention may be performed by any transformation method, and can be easily performed following the common method known in the art. In general, examples of the transformation methods include a CaCl2 precipitation, a Hanahan method that is an improved CaCl2 method by using DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) as a reducing material, electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation, protoplast fusion, agitation using silicon carbide fiber, <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation, PEG-mediated transformation, dextran sulfate-, lipofectamine-, and desiccation/inhibition-mediated transformation. The method for transformation of the vector comprising the polynucleotide that encodes UDP-glycosyltransferase of the present invention is not limited to these examples, and the transformation or transfection methods typically used in the art may be used without limitation.</p>

Examples thereof include tobacco, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, potato, <i>ginseng</i>, sesame, citron, <i>Bellis </i>or the like, but are not limited thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Any promoter can be used as a promoter of the present invention, as long as it is able to drive expression of the nucleic acid of the present invention in the host cell. For example, <i>E. coli</i>- or phage-derived promoters such as trp promoter, lac promoter, PL promoter, and PR promoter; <i>E. coli </i>infection phage-derived promoters such as T7 promoter, CaMV35S, MAS or histone promoter may be used. Synthetically modified promoters such as tac promoter may be also used.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The transformant that is introduced with the expression vector comprising the polynucleotide which encodes the UDP-glycosyltransferase protein of the present invention by the above method has a bioactivity of transferring a glucose by formation of O-glycosidic bond at the C-3 position of PPD-type ginsenoside. Preferably, the transformant means a transformant having capable capability of converting ginsenoside PPD into ginsenoside Rh2 or converting C-K into ginsenoside F2, but is not limited thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">As another aspect, the present invention provides a method for preparing the UDP-glycosyltransferase protein.</p>

      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Preferably, the preparation method comprises (a) culturing the transformant that is introduced with the vector comprising the polynucleotide that encodes the UDP-glycosyltransferase; (b) producing UDP-glycosyltransferase from the cultured transformant; and (c) recovering the produced UDP-glycosyltransferase.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Culturing of the transformant can be carried out by following a common method used in the art. A carbon source included in the growth medium for transformant may be selected by those skilled in the art according to the type of the transformant. And a suitable condition for culturing may be adopted in order to adjust the culturing time and amount.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">As another aspect, the present invention provides a method for preparing a glycosylated ginsenoside by converting a PPD (protopanaxadiol)-type ginsenoside using the UDP-glycosyltransferase, the transformant or the culture thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The UDP-glycosyltransferase, transformant, PPD-type ginsenoside, and glycosylated ginsenoside are the same as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">To be more specific, the method comprises the step of reacting the PPD-type ginsenoside with an UDP-glycosyltransferase protein represented by the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1, a transformant introduced with an expression vector comprising a polynucleotide that encodes the protein, or a culture of the transformant in the presence of UDP-sugar.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">As used herein the term âculture of the transformantâ means a product obtained by culturing the transformant according to the known method of culturing microorganisms. The culture includes the UDP-glycosyltransferase of SEQ ID NO. 1 of the present invention, and thus it is capable of converting PPD-type ginsenosides into glycosylated ginsenosides, for example, conversion of ginsenoside PPD into ginsenoside Rh2, or conversion of Compound K into ginsenoside F2.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">As the PPD-type ginsenoside used as a starting material in the present invention, isolated and purified ginsenoside, or ginsenoside included in a powder or extract of <i>ginseng </i>may be used. That is, a powder or extract of <i>ginseng </i>comprising ginsenoside may be directly used as a starting material to perform the method of the present invention. The <i>ginseng </i>used in the present invention includes the known various types of ginsengs, such as <i>Panax ginseng, P. quiquefolius, P. notoginseng, P. japonicus, P. trifolium, P. pseudoginseng </i>and <i>P. vietnamensis</i>, but is not limited thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Preferably, the conversion may occur through bioconversion of the PPD-type gisenoside into a glycosylated ginsenoside by UDP-glycosyltransferase of the present invention, transformant introduced with the expression vector comprising the polynucleotide that encodes the UDP-glycosyltransferase, or culture of the transformant, and it may be achieved by transferring sugar to hydroxyl group (âOH) at the C-3 position of ginsenosides. The protein represented by the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 of the present invention is able to convert a PPD-type ginsenoside having hydroxyl group at C-3 position, preferably PPD or C-K, into a glycosylated ginsenoside. The bioconversion by the protein represented by the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 of the present invention includes conversion of PPD into Rh2, and conversion of C-K into F2. Thus, the method of the present invention can be used in the fields that require glycosylated ginsenosides, in particular, ginsenoside Rh2 or F2.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The method for preparing glycosylated ginsenoside may further comprise the step of reacting the PPD-type ginsenoside with the UDP-glycosyltransferase protein which is represented by the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3, transformant introduced with the vector comprising the polynucleotide that encodes the protein, or culture of the transformant in the step of reacting PPD-type ginsenoside with the UDP-glycosyltransferase of SEQ ID NO. 1, transformant introduced with the vector comprising the polynucleotide that encodes the UDP-glycosyltransferase of SEQ ID NO. 1, or culture of the transformant.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">As used herein, the term âUDP-glycosyltransferase represented by the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3â means an enzyme that is capable of transferring a sugar moiety from UDP-sugar to ginsenoside by formation of Î²1,2 glycosidic linkage. The UDP-glycosyltransferase represented by the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3 has capable capability of transferring a sugar moiety from the sugar donor such as UDP-sugar to the sugar acceptor like 3-O-glucosylated ginsenoside so as to cause formation of Î²1,2 glycosidic bond. Thus, it converts 3-O-glucosylated ginsenoside into glycosylated ginsenoside. The UDP-glycosyltransferase represented by the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3 is a glycosyltransferase derived from <i>ginseng</i>, which was isolated for the first time by the present inventors, and can be interchangeably used with PgUGT94B1 in the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The sugar acceptor of the UDP-glycosyltransferase represented by the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3 is 3-O-glucosylated ginsenoside, and preferably ginsenoside Rh2 or F2, but is not limited thereto. Therefore, since the glycosyltransferase has an activity of transferring a sugar moiety by formation of Î²1,2 glycosidic linkage with the O-glucoside at the C-3 position of ginsenoside Rh2, it is able to convert ginsenoside Rh2 into ginsenoside Rg3. Likewise, since the glycosyltransferase has an activity of transferring a sugar moiety by formation of Î²1,2 glycosidic linkage with the O-glucoside at the C-3 position of ginsenoside F2, it is able to convert ginsenoside F2 into Rd.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Thus, if both of the UDP-glycosyltransferase that specifically acts on the hydroxyl group at the C-3 position of PPD-type ginsenoside and UDP-glycosyltransferase represented by the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO.3 are used, PPD can be converted into ginsenoside Rh2, which in turn can be converted into Rg3. Through this process, PPD can be converted into ginsenoside Rg3. If C-K is used as a starting material, C-K is converted into ginsenoside F2 by the glycosyltransferase of the present invention, which in turn is converted into ginsenoside Rd. Through this process, C-K is converted into ginsenoside Rd. In one example of the present invention, both PgUGT74A1 and PgUGT94B1 were used to convert PPD into ginsenoside Rg3 and convert C-K into ginsenoside Rd. Thus, it was confirmed that both of the above enzymes can be used to produce ginsenoside Rg3 and Rd with high yield (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>).</p>

When MeJA is sprayed onto the leaves of <i>ginseng</i>, PgUGT74A1 expression is enhanced. Therefore, since expression of PgUGT74A1 of the present invention is increased in <i>ginseng </i>by using MeJA, MeJA is useful for the production of ginsenosides. In one example of the present invention, it was found that PgUGT74A1 expression can be remarkably increased by the treatment with MeJA (<figref>FIG. 6B</figref>).</p>

      <heading id="h-00017-en" level="1">Sequence Analysis of UDP-Glycosyltransferases PgUGT74A1 and PgUGT94B1</heading>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0083">In order to investigate the role of UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) involved in biosynthesis of ginsenosides, EST database analysis was first performed to clone the UGT genes from <i>Panax ginseng </i>by the method described in Example 1. Among them, two types of UGTs named as PgUGT74A1 and PgUGT94B1 were investigated to determine their roles.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0084">The results of sequence analysis showed that they could not be specified by a sequence homology with UGTs derived from other plants including UGT from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana </i>(<i>A. thaliana</i>) (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>). To be more specific, PgUGT74A1 formed cluster with the UGT74 family of <i>A. thaliana</i>. The UGT74 family of <i>A. thaliana </i>consists of 7 types of UGTs which can be classified into 5 subfamilies (UGT74B, C, D, E1 and F). Although PgUGT74A1 formed cluster with the UGT74 family of <i>A. thaliana</i>, it could not belong to any of the 5 subfamilies, thereby indicating that PgUGT74A1 of the present invention falls into a new UGT74 subfamily distinct from other subfamilies of <i>A. thaliana</i>. Among the UGT74 families of <i>A. thaliana</i>, UGT74B1 glycosylates phenylacetothiohydroximate, which is a precursor of glucosinolate, by forming a glycosyl thioester linkage, while UGT74E2 glycosylates indole butylate by forming a glycosyl ester linkage. Likewise, UGT74F1 and UGT4F2 glycosylate salicyclate and anthranilate respectively by forming the glycosyl ester linkage as well. On the other hand, the UGT74 family members can also form an O-glycosidic linkage other than the glycosyl ester linkage. UGT74F1 is known to glycosylate salicyclate by forming a 2-O-glycosidic linkage. In addition, UGT74F1 and UGT74F2 glycosylate both salicyclate and anthranilate by forming the O-glycosidic linkage.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0085">Therefore, even those UGTs that belong to the UGT74 family of <i>A. thaliana </i>need to be investigated to identify the type of their substrates and the linkage they form for glycosylation.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0086">Furthermore, the analysis results demonstrated that PgUGT94B1 did not form cluster with the UGT94 family of <i>A. thaliana</i>, but instead with the UGT94 subfamilies of BpUGT94B1 (<i>Bellis perennis</i>), SiUGT94D1 (<i>Sesamumindicum </i>L.), CaUGT3 (<i>Catharanthus roseus</i>) and Cm1,2RhaT (<i>Citrus maxima</i>). Among them, BpUGT94B1 forms a Î²1,6 linkage to add a glucuronosyl moiety to the 3-O-glucoside of cyanidin, whereas SiUGT94D1forms the Î²1,6 linkage to add glucose to the 2-O-glucoside of sesaminol. CaUGT3 forms the Î²1,6 linkage to transfer a glucose molecule to quercetin-3-O-glucoside, while Cm1,2RhaT forms the Î²1,6 linkage to add rhanmnose to flavone 7-O-glucoside.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0087">Overall, the results demonstrated that all UGT94 family members which belong to the PgUGT94B1 catalyze the glycosylation that adds the second sugar molecule to the O-glycosylated receptor regardless of the types of sugar donor and receptor.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0088">These results indicate that PgUGT74A1 can form the O-glycosidic linkage or glycosyl ester linkage to catalyze glycosylation of ginsenosides, whereas PgUGT94B1 forms the Î²-glycosidic linkage to add the second sugar to the glycosylated ginsenoside, thereby catalyzing glycosylation. As indicated by the structures of ginsenosides of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, PPD-type ginsenosides can be glycosylated at its C-3 or C-20 position, or at both positions via the O-linkage, whereas PPT-type ginsenosides can be glycosylated at its C-6 or C-20 position, or at the both positions via the O-linkage. In addition, ginsenosides having one or more sugar groups comprising ginsenoside Rb1, Compound Y and Compound O, can be further glycosylated via the 13-1,6 linkage.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0089">Based on these results of sequence analysis, the actual activities of PgUGT74A1 and PgUGT94B1 were determined through Examples as below.</p>
      <heading id="h-00018-en" level="1">Experimental Example 2</heading>
      <heading id="h-00019-en" level="1">Conversion of PPD and C-K into Ginsenoside Rh2 and Ginsenoside F2 by PgUGT74A1</heading>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0090">Based on the sequence analysis results in Experimental Example 1, substrate specificity and regioselectivity of PgUGT74A1 and PgUGT94B1 were determined as follows.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0091">First, the recombinant PgUGT of Example 1, PgUGT74A1, was incubated with 10 different types of ginsenosides (PPD, C-K, Rh2, F2, Rg3, Rd, Rg2, Rh1, F1 and PPT) in the presence of UDP-glucose, and the products converted by the recombinant PgUGT were analyzed by TLC. The results are shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref><i>a. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0092">The results showed that PgUGT74A1 did not convert ginsenosides other than PPD and C-K, indicating that PgUGT74A1 has a high acceptor specificity (<figref>FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>). The above result was confirmed by migrating spot on TLC plate. As a result, PgUGT74A1 converted PPD and C-K into ginsenoside Rh2 and ginsenoside F2 respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0093">The result was further confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>. The results from HPLC showed that PgUGT74A1 of the present invention converted PPD and C-K into ginsenoside Rh2 and F2 respectively, as in the TLC analysis result. Unlike PgUGT74A1, PgUGT94B1 of Example 1 did not convert PPD and C-K into other ginsenosides (<figref>FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0094">As shown in the results of TLC and HPLC, PgUGT74A1 converted only the PPD-type ginsenosides such as PPD and C-K into ginsenoside Rh2 and ginsenoside F2 respectively, demonstrating its substrate specificity. Furthermore, when the carbon number that is to be glycosylated was determined, there was a specific glycosylation at the C-3 position of PPD-type ginsenoside via O-linkage while other positions such as the hydroxyl groups (âOH) at the C-12 and C-20 positions of PPD and the hydroxyl groups (âOH) at the C-3, C-6, C-12 and C-20 positions of PPT were not glycosylated, indicating that PgUGT74A1 has a regioselectivity to the C-3 position of the PPD-type ginsenosides. This result suggests that PgUGT74A1 of the present invention forms the O-glycosidic linkage to induce glycosylation.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0095">Overall, the above results demonstrate that PgUGT74A1 specifically acts on PPD-type ginsenosides, and has a strong substrate specificity for PPD and C-K, and regioselectivity for glycosylation at the C-3 position.</p>

      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0096">It was also examined whether PgUGT94B1 cloned in Example 1 has a substrate specificity and regioselectivity like PgUGT74A1.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0097">First, the recombinant PgUGT of Example 1, PgUGT94B1, was incubated with 10 different types of ginsenosides (PPD, C-K, Rh2, F2, Rg3, Rd, Rg2, Rh1, F1 and PPT) in the presence of UDP-glucose, and then the products converted by the recombinant PgUGT were analyzed by TLC. The results are shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>a. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0098">As a result, PgUGT94B1 did not convert ginsenosides other than ginsenoside Rh2 and F2, indicating that PgUGT94B1 has a high acceptor specificity (<figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>). This result was confirmed by a migrating spot on TLC plate. As a result, PgUGT94B1 converted ginsenoside Rh2 and ginsenoside F2 into ginsenoside Rg3 and ginsenoside Rd respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0099">The result was further confirmed by HPLC as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>. The HPLC results demonstrate that PgUGT94B1 converted ginsenoside Rh2 and F2 into ginsenoside Rg3 and Rd respectively, as in the TLC analysis result. On the other hand, PgUGT74A1 of the present invention did not convert ginsenoside Rh2 and F2, as in the results of Experimental Example 2 (<figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0100">According to these results, PgUGT94B1 specifically glycosylates the O-glucoside at C-3 position of Rh2 and F2 by forming 13-1,2 linkage, but not the O-glucoside at the C-20 position of C-K and F2. The above results suggest that PgUGT94B1 has a substrate specificity for Rh2 and F2 and regioselectivity for O-glucoside at the C-3 position.</p>

      <heading id="h-00023-en" level="1">Conversion of PPD and C-K into Ginsenoside Rg3 and Rd by PgUGT74A1 and PgUGT94B1</heading>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0101">Based on the results of Experimental Examples 2 and 3, it was conceived that when the two types of PgUGTs are used at the same time, <i>ginseng </i>PPD can be converted into ginsenoside Rh2, which in turn can be converted into Rg3, thereby producing Rg3 from PPD sequentially. Likewise, when both enzymes are used, C-K can be converted into ginsenoside F2, which in turn can be converted into ginsenoside Rd, thereby producing Rd from C-K sequentially.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0102">In order to confirm this, the above two enzymes were reacted with PPD as a substrate in a single reaction tube. The result showed that PPD was successfully converted into Rg3 (upper panel of <figref>FIG. 5</figref>). In addition, the two enzymes were reacted with C-K as a substrate in a single reaction tube. The result showed that C-K was also successfully converted into Rd (lower panel of <figref>FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0103">The above results demonstrate that PPD and C-K can be converted into Rg3 and Rd respectively by using a combination of PgUGT74A1 and PgUGT94B1 of the present invention in a single reaction tube in vitro. Thus, PgUGT74A1 and PgUGT94B1 can be used for an efficient production of Rg3 and Rd.</p>

      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0104">It was investigated whether PgUGT74A1 and PgUGT94B1 of the present invention were mainly expressed in the roots of <i>ginseng </i>that had been used for a medical purpose traditionally. Also, organ-specific expression patterns were examined for two types of PgUGTs of the present invention along with three different ginseoside biosynthetic genes such as PgDS (dammarenediol-II synthase), PgPPDS (protopanaxadiol synthase), and PgPPTS (protopanaxatriol synthase). The leaf and root of 15-month old <i>ginseng </i>were used for the expression analysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0105">The result demonstrated that all of the above ginseoside biosynthetic genes were expressed in the leaf and root of <i>ginseng</i>, and particularly in the glucosylation-activated roots (<figref>FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0106">As shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, all of the 5 genes of interest were expressed in the leaf and root of <i>ginseng</i>, but there was a difference in their expression levels. The expression of PgUGT74A1 and PgUGT94B1 of the present invention was higher in the root than in the leaf. PgDS and PgPPDS genes that are involved in biosynthesis of ginsenosides showed higher expression level in the leaf of <i>ginseng</i>, whereas PgPPTS showed similar expression levels in both root and leaf of <i>ginseng</i>. These results suggest that ginsenosides are synthesized in both leaf and root of <i>ginseng</i>, but glucosylation occurs more actively in the root compared to the leaf.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0107">Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) has been reported to enhance the expression of ginsenoside biosynthetic genes in hairy root cultures. Knowing the effect of MeJA, it was examined whether the expression of the UDP-glycosyltransferase of the present invention can be increased by MeJA.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0108">The 15-month old <i>ginseng </i>grown in a growth chamber under LD conditions was collected, and MeJA was sprayed onto its leaves everyday for a total of 5 days. To analyze expression level of the ginsenoside biosynthetic genes, samples were collected on the 6th days. The two types of PgUGTs of the present invention showed a higher expression level in the leaves of <i>ginseng </i>which was treated with MeJA, suggesting that MeJA is capable of facilitating the expression of UGTs of the present invention (<figref>FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>). In addition to the above PgUGTs, MeJA also enhanced the expression of PgDS and PgPPDS. However, expression of PgPPTS was not induced by MeJA under the conditions of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0109">Overall, the expression analysis results demonstrate that the ginsenoside concentrations can be increased with the addition of MeJA. In this regard, the concentrations of 4 major ginsenosides were measured after spraying MeJA onto the leaf of <i>ginseng</i>. The treatment of MeJA increased the concentrations of two PPD-type ginsenosides, Rd and Rb1, by 1.55 and 1.14 times respectively (<figref>FIG. 6</figref><i>c</i>). In addition, the treatment of MeJA increased the concentrations of two PPT-type ginsenosides, Rg1 and Re, by 2.61 and 1.45 times respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0110">These results suggest that addition of MeJA onto <i>ginseng </i>plant facilitates the expression of various ginsenoside biosynthetic genes and increases production of ginsenosides in <i>ginseng</i>. The results also suggest that since MeJA enhances the expression of PgUGT74A1 and PgUGT94B1 which are the representative glycosyltransferase of the present invention, it can be used for enhancing the expression of PgUGT74A1 and PgUGT94B1.</p>
