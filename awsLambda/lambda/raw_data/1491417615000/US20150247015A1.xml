      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a resin composition, particularly relates to a thermosetting resin composition and its usage in resin sheet, resin composite metallic foil, prepreg, laminate, metal clad laminate and printed circuit board.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In recent years, with the development of intendancy of high performance, high function and network of computer and information communication equipment, in order to transmit and process large load of information in high speed, the operation signals intend to be of high frequency, therefore new requirements were put forward on the development of the circuit board towards the direction of high multilayer and high wiring density, and the substrate material used. These requirements include: 1, good dielectric properties (low dielectric constant and low dielectric loss angle tangent), and keeping stable in a wide range of temperature and frequency; 2, being resistant to shock of acid and alkali, high temperature and high humidity environment in PCB process, without swelling for moisture absorption and the consequent lamination rupture; 3, suitable for processing and installation requirements under high temperatures; 4, good safety of flame retardant.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">However, among the current materials for preparation of printed circuit board, binders with epoxy resin as main part are widely used. The ordinary epoxy resin circuit board (FR-4 board) has the main components of low brominated or high brominated epoxy resin prepared with bisphenol A epoxy resin or tetrabromobisphenol A epoxy resin, and curing agent dicyandiamide, solvent and catalyst are added in preparation. The ordinary epoxy resin circuit board (FR-4 copper clad laminate) can meet most of the requirements of the printed circuit, but the ordinary epoxy resin circuit board (FR-4 copper clad laminate) has too low glass transition temperature (Tg), poor heat resistance and high dielectric constant and dielectric loss angle tangent (dielectric constant 4.4, dielectric loss angle tangent about 0.02), thus its high frequency property is insufficient and cannot adapt to the requirement of intendancy of high frequency of signal. In order to make the epoxy resin meet the usage requirements as much as possible after curing, the researchers in the prior art adopted curing agents with low polarity, such as styrene maleic anhydride copolymer (SMA) or other curing agents with low polarity, to modify the epoxy resin to improve its high frequency dielectric properties and heat resistance. These research results will be further discussed in the following.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">BE627887 discloses an epoxy resin composition wherein the styrene maleic anhydride copolymer (SMA, structural formula thereof is as follows) is used as the epoxy resin crosslinking agent. This epoxy resin composition has the disadvantage of poor thermal stability, thus it is not suitable to be used in the substrate copper clad laminate of multilayer printed circuit board (PCB).</p>

      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0005">Addressing the ordinary epoxy resin circuit board (FR-4 board), which has the main components of low brominated or high brominated epoxy resin prepared with bisphenol A epoxy resin or tetrabromobisphenol A epoxy resin, is prepared with addition of curing agent dicyandiamide, solvent and catalyst, and has the disadvantage of low glass transition temperature Tg (120-140Â° C.) and poor heat resistance, the researchers in the prior art usually adopted multifunctional epoxy resin to replace difunctional epoxy resin, or adopted phenolic resin to replace dicyandiamide, in order to increase curing crosslinking density to improve the glass transition temperature, and improve the heat resistance, but this method can not improve the high-frequency electrical properties of board.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 6,509,414 adopted styrene maleic anhydride copolymer as curing agent, tetrabromobisphenol A, tetrabromobisphenol A epoxy resin or their mixture as co-curing agent for FR-4 epoxy resin curing to improve the glass transition temperature and thermal stability. But the styrene maleic anhydride copolymer in the composition is brittle, thus the prepared prepreg (for preparing printed circuit board) is fairly brittle. In cutting, the resin on the edge of the prepreg is easy to dust, which is sometimes referred to as âmushroom effectâ and would bring hidden quality danger to the processing technology. Furthermore, there are two hydroxy with very large polarity in the tetrabromobisphenol A molecular structure, thus the introduction of tetrabromobisphenol A has deteriorated the dielectric properties of the system to a certain extent.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0007">In U.S. Pat. No. 6,667,107, difunctional cyanate ester and its self-polymer, styrene maleic anhydride and its derivative and epoxy resin etc. are adopted to prepare a kind of copper clad laminate composition with low dielectric constant and dielectric loss angle tangent. In the copper clad laminate composition, cyanate ester resin and styrene maleic anhydride and its derivatives were co-adopted to improve the glass transition temperature of the epoxy resin system, and it has excellent dielectric properties of high frequency, but the molecular structure of the styrene maleic anhydride copolymer adopted in this system has anhydride groups, which can generate carboxyl groups with poor thermal stability and moisture-heat resistance; as it is adopted in concert with cyanate ester which has poor moisture-heat resistance, the moisture-heat resistance is further deteriorated. Addition of epoxy resin has improved the moisture-heat resistance properties in a certain extent, but the improvement is limited and the problem cannot be eliminated fundamentally, therefore in preparation process of PCB, the boards are susceptible to etch of moisture and develop delamination, and the product qualified rate is very low.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0008">The Japanese Patent Publication 2003-252958 discloses a kind of biphenyl epoxy resin and active ester composition, which has excellent dielectric constant and dielectric loss angle tangent after curing. But it is a kind of bifunctional biphenyl epoxy resin that is adopted, which has low crosslinking density with the active ester; therefore it has the disadvantage of low glass transition temperature and low heat resistance of the cured products.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0009">In the Japanese Patent Publication 2009-235165, active ester cured epoxy resin with structural formula Y and no styrene structure is adopted, and cured product with higher glass transition temperature can be obtained:</p>

      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0000">Glass transition temperature (Tg): DSC test is adopted. Test is made according to DSC test methods specified in IPC-TM-650 2.4.25. <br /> Peeling strength is tested according to the experimental conditions of âPost thermal stressâ in IPC-TM-650 2.4.8 method. <br /> Dielectric constant and dielectric loss angle tangent: it is tested under the 5 GHz accordance to SPDR method. <br /> Evaluation of soldering resistance: copper clad laminate is impregnated in the tin stove of 288Â° C. for 20 seconds, and cooled down to room temperature. Then it is impregnated in the tin stove again, which is repeated 20 times. Soldering resistance is evaluated through observing the appearance. <br /> PCT water absorption testing: The copper clad laminate is impregnated in the copper etching solution. The superficial copper foil is removed for substrate evaluation. The substrate is placed in a pressure cooker under 121Â° C., 2 atm for 2 hours for treatment. Then the water absorption rate of the substrate is tested. Evaluation of Solder resistanca after PCT: Copper clad laminate is impregnated in the copper etching solution. The superficial copper foil is removed for substrate evaluation. The substrate is placed in a pressure cooker under 121Â° C., 2 atm for 2 hours for treatment. Then it is impregnated in tin stove of 288Â° C. When the substrate bubbles or splits, the corresponding time is recorded. When the substrate does not bubble or delaminate after 5 minutes in the tin stove, evaluation can be ended. Combustion property is tested according to UL-94 test method. </p>
