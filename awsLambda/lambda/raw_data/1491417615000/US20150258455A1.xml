      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims priority from and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2014-0029276, filed on Mar. 12, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a game method and system for a league game.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In a simulation method and system using communication between a server and a terminal according to the related art, it is inconvenient to download a program for a simulation and install the downloaded program in a terminal. In addition, the simulation is allowed to run only in the terminal in which the program is installed. For example, in the case of simulating a league of a sports game such as a soccer game, a user may simulate the sports game only in a terminal in which a relevant program is installed, and thus, may experience spatial constraints. In addition, when a simulation proceeds at predetermined time intervals through association between a plurality of users, a user may experience both temporal and spatial constraints.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a game method and system that may perform a league game by grouping teams of users based on a level-based league, or grouping a team including at least one bot with the teams of the users based on a level-based league, and by processing a game to be automatically performed between teams of users included in the same league at predetermined time intervals.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention also provide a game method and system that may minimize temporal constraints and spatial constraints, by providing a web-based simulation for a league game, and may further provide a simulation of a sports game by simplifying a simulation representation.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention also provide a game method and system that may perform a game by offering a user a variety of abilities based on conditions of characters included in a single team and by applying, to at least one character, abilities corresponding to a predetermined number of team features selected by the user from among the offered team features.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention also provide a game method and system that may perform a game by determining a chemistry value indicating a relationship between characters, based on a relationship between characters included in a single team, by graphically displaying the determined chemistry value on a screen, and by applying the chemistry value between characters.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Additional features of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention disclose a game method performed by a game system embodied as a computer, the method including configuring a level-based league for teams of users; performing a league game between teams included in the level-based league at predetermined time intervals regardless of whether the users connect to the game system, providing runtime broadcasting information about the league game to a terminal of a user in response to a request for observing the league game from the user that connects to the game system over a network during a period in which the league game is ongoing, and calculating and managing a progress result of the league game. The runtime broadcasting information may include information used to display a movement of a mechanical object made in response to an action set for the mechanical object, using a line that connects a start location of the movement and an end location of the movement.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention also disclose a game method performed by a game system embodied as a computer, the method including configuring a level-based league for teams of users, performing a league game between teams included in the level-based league at predetermined time intervals regardless of whether the users connect to the game system, providing runtime broadcasting information about the league game to a terminal of a user in response to a request for observing the league game from the user that connects to the game system over a network during a period in which the league game is ongoing, and calculating and managing a progress result of the league game.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.</p>

      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. These exemplary embodiments will be described in detail for those skilled in the art in order to practice the present invention. It should be appreciated that various exemplary embodiments of the present invention are different but do not have to be exclusive.

      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing exemplary embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms “a”, “an”, and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms “comprises” and/or “comprising”, when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being “connected to” another element, it can be directly connected to the other element, or intervening elements may be present.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a relationship between a game system <b>100</b> and a terminal <b>110</b> according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Referring to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the game system <b>100</b>, the terminal <b>110</b>, and a webpage <b>120</b> are provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The game system <b>100</b> may refer to a server that is configured to manage users and account information of the users. The game system <b>100</b> may be further configured to provide game data to the terminal <b>110</b>, through the webpage <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The terminal <b>110</b> may refer to a user device, such as a personal computer (PC) or a smartphone, which may access to the webpage <b>120</b> through wired or wireless communication.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">A user may access the webpage <b>120</b> through the terminal <b>110</b>. The user may adjust and set a variety of settings during the progress of a game, such as a login, a selection of camp, a selection of character, a selection of strategy, and predetermined processes for enhancing abilities of a character. Here, the game system <b>100</b> may perform a game based on settings of users and abilities of characters, and may provide a progress simulation of the game or a progress result of the game to a user through the webpage <b>120</b>. The progress simulation of the game or the progress result of the game may be displayed on a screen of the terminal <b>110</b> connected to the webpage <b>120</b> and may thereby be provided to the user. For example, the terminal <b>110</b> may configure a screen using a HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and/or JavaScript. Also, messaging between the game system <b>100</b> and the terminal <b>110</b> may be processed using HTTP-based ajax, comet, and/or reverse ajax.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In this example, the progress of a game may be processed by the game system <b>100</b> and thus, processing of game progress by the user terminal <b>110</b> may be fundamentally prevented. For example, in the case of a soccer game, a scenario for the progress of a game or a result of the game may be determined in advance based on abilities of characters of two teams that are playing the soccer game, formation between characters, a team feature, and a chemistry operation, to be described later. A simulation result or a game result corresponding to the determined scenario may be provided to users through the webpage <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Accordingly, although the user does not install a separate program in the terminal <b>110</b>, the user may obtain the game simulation or the game result through a basic browser and thus, the inconvenience coming from downloading and installing a program may be avoided.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In a game method according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a game may be performed by grouping teams of users into level-based leagues, and by performing a league game or a tournament between teams belonging to a single league. For example, teams of each user may represent soccer teams configured by the respective users, and the soccer teams of the respective users may be grouped into level-based leagues. Herein, the user that creates a given team may be referred to as an owner. As an example, level-based leagues may include, but are not limited to, a Rookie League, an Amateur League, a Semi-Pro League, a Pro League 1, a Pro League 2, a Pro League 3, and a Championship League. Each level-based league may also include leagues based on the number of users. In an example in which a single league includes 12 teams and the number of teams of users to be included in a rookie league is 120, ten rookie leagues each including 12 teams, may be configured. If the number of teams of users is 110, the remaining ten teams to configure ten rooky leagues may be configured as non-player controlled and managed (“bot”) teams.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Teams constituting a single league may play in a league game that is automatically executed at predetermined time intervals. For example, regardless of whether users connect to the game system. Once the league is terminated, teams ranking a predetermined place or more may advance to a higher level league, and may play a league game again in the higher level league.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Here, although a game between teams is automatically performed by the game system <b>100</b>, a progress result of the game may be determined by applying a variety of setting values set by a user, such as abilities of characters held by users. For example, these abilities may include soccer player character, formations, and strategies. For example, the game system <b>100</b> may include a scenario pool that stores probable scenarios for the progress of a game. The game system <b>100</b> may produce a result by probabilistically selecting from the scenario pool, and listing a scenario suitable for a current situation using a basic factor and a control factor. The basic factor may include preset values, such as abilities of players, an initial formation, and an initial strategy. The control factor may include a factor for a user-set a strategy. For example, taking a soccer game as an example, the control factor may include values adjustable by a user before or during a game, such as a weight for a flank attack, a weight for a center attack, a frequency of mid-range shooting, a level of balance between an attack and a defense, a type of a pass in a team (for example, a short pass or a long pass), a frequency of pass or dribble, and a weight for each formation.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Automatically proceeding games may be broadcasted in runtime for users desiring to observe the games. Hereinafter, examples of a simulation method for broadcasting such a game in runtime will be described.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a simulation method performed by a terminal according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. For example, the simulation method of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> may be performed by the terminal <b>110</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In operation <b>210</b>, the terminal <b>110</b> may verify an action set for a mechanical object. Herein, the mechanical object may correspond to a virtual object movable in response to an action of a virtual character appearing in a simulation. For example, the mechanical object may include a ball object. A ball may indicate a round exercise tool that is made of leather, rubber, or plastic, and can be passed, dribbled, kicked, or rolled. The ball object may indicate a virtual ball that is represented on the simulation and may be moved in response to an action of a character.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In operation <b>220</b>, the terminal <b>110</b> may display a movement of the mechanical object made in response to the action, using a line that connects a start location of the movement and an end location of the movement. For example, the action may occur in response to a motion that is triggered by at least one character among a plurality of characters, with respect to the mechanical object. For example, the mechanical object may include a ball object, and the motion that is triggered by the at least one character with respect to the mechanical object may include at least one of pass, dribble, intercept, and shooting that are triggered by the at least one character with respect to the ball object. A character may include a virtual character capable of interacting with the ball object. A success of the motion may be determined based on at least one of a location and abilities of each of characters, a formation, abilities of each of camps into which the characters are grouped, a characteristic for each motion, and a strategy determined by a user.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example of displaying a movement of a mechanical object <b>310</b> using a line according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. A first screen <b>300</b> refers to an example of a screen displayed on a display of the terminal <b>110</b> through the webpage <b>120</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. Here, <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a simulation result in which the mechanical object <b>310</b> has moved from a start location <b>320</b> to a location indicated on the first screen <b>300</b>. The end location described in operation <b>220</b> may be a center of the mechanical object <b>310</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">For example, in the case of simulating a soccer game, the mechanical object <b>310</b> may be a soccer ball object, and the first screen <b>300</b> may show a scene in which an action of a first character passing a soccer ball to a second character has been simulated. As described above, although a character is not separately displayed, a method of providing simulation information may be simplified by displaying a movement of the mechanical object <b>310</b> made in response to an action of a character using a line.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">As another example, identification (ID) information of a character controlling the mechanical object <b>310</b> and ID information of the action may be further displayed in conjunction with the line or the mechanical object <b>310</b>. <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example in which “success in pass” <b>330</b> that is ID information of the action is further displayed in conjunction with the mechanical object <b>310</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In a simulation method according to exemplary embodiments, at least one of a type and a thickness of the line may be determined based on the type of action of the mechanical object <b>310</b> and/or characters, as shown below.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example of a type of a line determined based on an action according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. A second screen <b>400</b> shows a scene in which the mechanical object <b>310</b> of the first screen <b>300</b> has been additionally moved. Here, to indicate that the additional movement of the mechanical object <b>310</b> of <figref>FIG. 4</figref> has been made, in response to an action different from the action of <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the initial movement is indicated using a solid line <b>410</b> and the additional movement is indicated using a dotted line <b>420</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">For example, as described above with the example of <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the solid line <b>410</b> may indicate the action of the first character passing the soccer ball to the second character. The dotted line <b>420</b> may refer to a scene in which an action of the second character receiving and then dribbling the soccer ball has been simulated.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Here, <figref>FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example in which “success in dribble” <b>430</b>. That is, ID information of the action is further displayed in conjunction with the mechanical object <b>310</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">In a simulation method according to exemplary embodiments, a color of the line may be determined based on a camp of a character controlling the mechanical object <b>310</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example of displaying a movement of the mechanical object <b>310</b> made by characters of a first camp according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, and <figref>FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example of displaying a movement of the mechanical object <b>310</b> made by characters of a second camp according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">A third screen <b>500</b> shows a scene in which the mechanical object <b>310</b> of the second screen <b>400</b> has been additionally moved. For example, the third screen <b>500</b> illustrates a simulation result in which the second character of the first camp has dribbled the soccer ball and then attempted to pass the soccer ball. However, the soccer ball has been intercepted by a third character of a second camp and thus, possession of the mechanical object <b>310</b> has been turned over to the second camp.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">A fourth screen <b>600</b> shows a scene in which a movement of the mechanical object <b>310</b> has been made by a character of the second camp. For example, the fourth screen <b>600</b> illustrates a simulation result in which the third character of the second camp has dribbled the intercepted soccer ball and has successfully passed the soccer ball to a fourth character of the second camp. Here, dissimilar to the third screen <b>500</b>, a color of the line may be changed from black to gray on the fourth screen <b>600</b>. As described above, the color of the line may be determined based on a camp of a character controlling the mechanical object <b>310</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">As described above, in a case in which the simulation proceeds through association between characters belonging to a plurality of camps, and a movement of a mechanical object is made in response to continuous actions of characters belonging to the same camp, the movement of the mechanical object may be displayed using continuous lines. In this example, if possession of the mechanical object is turned over to a character of another camp and thereby the mechanical object is moved, the existing lines may be removed and a subsequent movement of the mechanical object may be displayed again using lines.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In the manner described above, actions continuously occurring due to characters of the same camp may be represented as a single scene.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">Referring again to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, although not illustrated, operation <b>210</b> may additionally include receiving, from a simulation server, scene data including at least one set of unit data, and verifying an action included in the at least one set of unit data. The above operations may also be performed by the terminal <b>110</b>. The simulation server may correspond to the game system <b>100</b> or may be included in the game system <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">The unit data may include information about an action occurring because of one plurality of characters grouped into different camps, an action occurring between two characters grouped into the same camp, or an action occurring between two characters grouped into different camps. For example, in the case of simulating a soccer game, the action occurring due to one character may include an action such as “dribble” or “shooting”. Also, the action occurring between two characters grouped into the same camp may include “pass”. The action occurring between two characters grouped into different camps may include “intercept” or “goalkeeper's nice blocking”</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">Also, the scene data may include unit data of at least one action continuously occurring due to characters grouped into the same camp. That is, the scene data may include information about actions included in a single scene. For example, on the third screen <b>500</b> of <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, three continued actions, “success in pass”, “success in dribble”, and “intercepted” may compose a single scene.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The game system <b>100</b> may provide data to the terminal <b>110</b>, based on a unit of scene data. The terminal <b>110</b> may indicate lines based on a unit of an action, using unit data included in scene data. Here, to enhance the system efficiency, the game system <b>100</b> may generate, in advance, scene data for the entire simulation prior to providing a simulation result, and may provide the scene data to the terminal <b>110</b> through the webpage <b>120</b>, based on a unit of scene data.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">According to exemplary embodiments, the simulation method of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> may determine an occurrence of a highlight scene, that is, whether the highlight scene has occurred, based on a probability set for a type of scene data. For example, the simulation method may verify whether the highlight scene has occurred based on a probability set for each scene including a plurality of actions. Here, in operation <b>220</b>, in response to the occurrence of the highlight scene, the terminal <b>110</b> may display a movement process of character objects for a plurality of characters and a movement process of the mechanical object, instead of using the line. Taking a simulation of a soccer game as an example, the highlight scene may occur 100% of the time for a successful goal scene, 50% of the time for an unsuccessful goal scene, and 50% of the time for an offside scene. A single highlight scene may be probabilistically selected from among highlight scenes closest to a current situation through a set of control variables for each highlight scene in a pool configured through an exclusive editor. The game system <b>100</b> may transfer data associated with the highlight scene to the terminal <b>110</b> using a protocol, for example, a JavaScript Object Notation (“JSON”) format, predetermined between the game system <b>100</b> and the terminal <b>110</b>. Also, the highlight scene may be displayed in such a manner that the terminal <b>110</b> loads the data transferred through JavaScript, for example, a JavaScript eval( ) function, to a storage unit such as a memory, verifies a type of unit data to be displayed, and displays the type of unit data using a display method suitable for each type.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">
        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an example of a highlight scene according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. A fifth screen <b>700</b> refers to an example of a scene in which all of character objects for characters of two camps and the mechanical object <b>310</b> are displayed. In the example of <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, characters of a first camp are indicated as rectangular character objects, and characters of a second camp are indicated as triangular character objects. Here, by displaying a movement process of the character objects and a movement process of the mechanical object <b>310</b> instead of displaying a movement of the mechanical object <b>310</b> using a line for each action, it is possible to provide a simulation result of actions included in the highlight scene.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">Information used to represent a soccer stadium is displayed as an example of a soccer game simulation on the fifth screen <b>700</b>. Although only the mechanical object <b>310</b> and lines are indicated in <figref>FIGS. 3 through 6</figref>, a variety of additional information may be displayed based on a type of simulation. Further, although only character objects of each camp are displayed, a character object such as a referee may be further displayed depending on a necessity.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">According to exemplary embodiments, an action may occur in response to a motion of which a success is determined based on at least one of a location and abilities of each of the plurality of characters, a formation, abilities of each of camps into which characters are grouped, a characteristic for each motion, and a strategy determined by a user. For example, whether a “pass” motion has succeeded may be determined based on at least one of the aforementioned information. In response to a success of the “pass” motion, a “success in pass” action may occur. In response to a failure of the “pass” motion, an “intercepted” action or an “end-line out” action may occur.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">For example, the soccer game simulation may use factors as follows, however, these factors are not limited thereto, and a person having skill in the art will recognize that there are many other factors that may be used additionally or alternatively:</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">1.

      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0097">Also, in the example of the soccer game simulation, a success of each motion may be determined based on examples as follows:</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0098">1. “Pass” motion: A success of the pass motion is probabilistically determined by comparing an absolute value and a relative value with respect to individual abilities of an attacker required for the pass, individual abilities of a defender, and integrated abilities of each team or camp, based on a characteristic of each pass, for example, a pass type such as a short pass, a long pass, and a cross pass in such regions such as an attacking camp, a middle camp, and a defending camp, each having a respective strategy employed for attack or defense at a pass point.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0099">2. “Dribble” motion: A success of the dribble motion is probabilistically determined by comparing an absolute value and a relative value with respect to individual abilities of an attacker required for the dribble, individual abilities of a defender, and integrated abilities of each team or camp, based on a characteristic of each dribble, for example, a dribble type such as a short dribble and a long dribble, a region such as an attacking camp, a middle camp, and a defending camp, each region having a respective strategy employed for attack or defense at a dribble point.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0100">3. “Shooting” motion: A success of the shooting motion is probabilistically determined by comparing an absolute value and a relative value with respect to individual abilities of an attacker, individual abilities of a defender, and integrated abilities of each team or camp required for shooting, based on a characteristic of each shooing, for example, a shooting type such as a short shooting, a mid-range shooting, and a long shooting in different regions such as a penalty area, a front area, and a flank area.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0101">According to exemplary embodiments, the webpage <b>120</b> may include a user interface for changing at least one of a formation, a strategy, and a character. For example, the terminal <b>110</b> may provide a user with the user interface by displaying the webpage <b>120</b>. In this example, the game system <b>100</b> may regenerate scene data after a point in time when the change is made, may provide the regenerated scene data to the terminal <b>110</b> through the webpage <b>120</b>, and thereby apply a real-time intervention of the user during a simulation process.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an example of a user interface <b>800</b> according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. The user interface <b>800</b> may be displayed on a screen of the terminal <b>110</b> together with screens described above with reference to <figref>FIGS. 3 through 7</figref>. Among team players of a user of the terminal <b>110</b>, for example, characters of a user camp, key players and substitute players are distinguishably grouped and thereby displayed on the user interface <b>800</b>. As shown in a dotted-line box <b>810</b>, the user interface <b>800</b> may include functions for a player substitution, a strategy instruction, and a formation change. For example, a player, a strategy, and/or a formation changed by the user may be applied to a simulation from a subsequent shift point in time between attack and defense, for example, from a subsequent scene, which may affect a result of a game, for example, a simulation result.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a simulation method performed by a game system according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. The simulation method according to the present exemplary embodiments may be performed by the game system <b>100</b> or a processor unit included in the game system <b>100</b>. The game system <b>100</b> may include at least one processor unit and at least one communication unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0104">In operation <b>910</b>, the game system <b>100</b> or the processor unit may store and manage, in a scenario pool, information about probable scenarios, in conjunction with a movement of a mechanical object on a simulation. For example, in a soccer game simulation, scenarios of motions probable during a soccer game may be generated, stored, and managed in the scenario pool.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0105">In operation <b>920</b>, the game system <b>100</b> or the processor unit may select at least one scenario from the scenario pool. For example, in operation <b>920</b>, the game system <b>100</b> may select at least one scenario based on a basic factor including information about a scenario start location for connection between the scenarios and a control factor including a factor setting a strategy of a user.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0106">For example, in the case of simulating a soccer game, a location of a soccer ball at a point in time when one scenario ends may be compared to a start location of a subsequent scenario using the basic factor. Also, in the above example of simulating the soccer game, the control factor may include at least one of setting values as follows: <ul id="ul-00009-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00010-en" list-style="none"><li>Presence of flank or center attack</li><li>Frequency of mid-range shooting</li><li>Level of balance between attack and defense</li><li>Type of pass (short or long)</li><li>Frequency of pass or dribble</li><li>Weight for each formation</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0113">Each scenario may include path information regarding a movement of a mechanical object. A role of a character corresponding to a main entity and a type of a movement may be defined in each item of movement information. The type of the movement may include a motion of a character. In the example of simulating the soccer game, the mechanical object may include a ball object and the motion may include at least one of pass, dribble, intercept, and shooting that may be triggered using the ball object. As described above, an action, such as “success in pass”, and “intercepted” may occur in response to a success or failure in a corresponding motion. The role of the character may be defined as a role on a formation, such as a striker (ST), a center mid-fielder (CM), a center back (CB), and a right wing (RW).</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0114">In operation <b>930</b>, the game system <b>100</b> or the processor unit may generate scene data based on whether motions included in the selected scenario have succeeded or failed. Here, the scene data may include unit data about an action corresponding to a continuously successful motion among the motions included in the selected scenario.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0115">For example, in the soccer game simulation, in an example in which a ball is intercepted in a left-mid-fielder area and settings are made such as an operation strategy as a 4-4-2 formation, preference of a flank attack, an attack-oriented balance, a pass preference, a high pass frequency, and a low mid-range shooting frequency, one scenario may be selected from among scenarios starting in a middle guard area. For example, the game system <b>100</b> or the processor unit may assign a probability weigh to each scenario selected based on operation strategy settings of the user and then randomly select a scenario.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0116">The following scenario may be assumed to have been selected.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0117">A player having a position RM-breaking through a right wing with dribble→RM-centering→a player having the position ST-heading shoot→END</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0118">The game system <b>100</b> or the processor unit may match a player defined per unit motion in the selected scenario with player information of an actual team as follows:</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0119">CB(AAA), CM(BBB), ST(CCC), RM(DDD), where CB, CM, ST, and RM are player positions, and AAA, BBB, CCC, and DDD are player names.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0120">A success probability of a motion may be calculated for each motion.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0121">A first motion refers to breaking through a right wing with dribble, and a success of the first motion may be probabilistically determined by comparing abilities of a player DDD to abilities of a defending player of an opponent team. For example, abilities to be compared may be main strength, acceleration, quickness, and dribble speed.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0122">In this example, when the motion is determined to have succeeded, the motion moves to a subsequent motion. Conversely, when the motion is determined to have failed, scene data including unit data of an action such as “blocking a dribble” may be generated and a subsequent scenario, for example, a scenario of an opponent team may be performed.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0123">If the first motion succeeds, a success probability of a second motion of the selected scenario may be calculated. The second motion refers to centering to ST (CCC), and a success of the second motion may be probabilistically determined by comparing abilities of the player DDD, abilities of a player CCC, and abilities of a defender of an opponent team. For example, abilities of the player DDD for cross, visual field, and presence of mind, abilities of the player CCC for positioning, ball control, and body balance, and a defending capability of the defender of the opponent team may be used for comparison.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0124">If the second motion fails, scene data including unit data about a “success in dribble” and an “intercepted” action may be generated and a subsequent scenario, for example, a scenario of the opponent team may proceed.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0125">Conversely, if the second motion succeeds, a success probability of a third motion of the selected scenario may be calculated. The third motion refers to a heading shoot of ST (CCC) and the success of the third motion may be probabilistically determined by comparing abilities of the player CCC, abilities of the defender of the opponent team, and abilities of a goal keeper of the opponent team. For example, abilities of the player CCC for shooting, goal decisiveness, heading, and presence of mind, a defending capability of the defender of the opponent team, and abilities of the goalkeeper of the opponent for reflexes and ball handling may be used for comparison.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0126">If the shooting motion succeeds, the score is adjusted accordingly and a kickoff scenario of the opponent team may be selected and proceed. Conversely, if the third motion fails, scene data including unit data about a “success in dribble” action, a “success in pass” action, and a “goalkeeper punching” action may be generated and a subsequent scenario, for example, a scenario of the opponent team may proceed.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0127">If a motion fails, a variety of actions such as a “line-out” action, a “side-out” action, a “defense foul” action, an “offense foul” action, and a “goalkeeper's nice blocking” may each occur additionally or alternatively to the “intercepted” action and the “goalkeeper punching” action.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0128">A predetermined amount of physical time, for example, ten seconds may be allocated to each unit motion. A result of repeatedly configuring such a scenario until a game is over may be configured as a single soccer game simulation result.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0129">As described above, scene data for the entire simulation may be generated prior to providing a simulation result. Based on at least one of a formation, a strategy, and a character changed through a user interface for changing at least one of the formation, the strategy, and the character, a client may regenerate scene data after a point in time when the change is made. Accordingly, a user may intervene in the simulation result.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0130">In operation <b>940</b>, the game system <b>100</b> or the processor unit may transmit the generated scene data to the client. Here, the client, for example, the terminal <b>110</b> may verify an action based on the scene data, and may display a movement of the mechanical object made in response to the verified action using a line that connects a start location of the movement and an end location of the movement.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0131">According to exemplary embodiments, although not illustrated, the simulation method of <figref>FIG. 9</figref> may further include determining an occurrence of a highlight scene based on a probability that is preset based on a type of scene data, selecting scene data corresponding to the highlight scene from a highlight pool, and transmitting the selected scene data to the client in response to the occurrence of the highlight scene. For example, the highlight pool may directly include a variety of scene data, which differs from the scenario pool.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0132">According to exemplary embodiments, the game system <b>100</b> may further include a storage unit configured to store information about at least one of a location and abilities of each of the plurality of characters, a formation, abilities of each of camps into which the plurality of characters is grouped, a characteristic for each motion, and a strategy determined by a user. In this example, the processor unit may determine whether the motion has succeeded based on at least one item of the information.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0133">According to exemplary embodiments, the processor unit for the entire simulation may be generated prior to providing a simulation result. When at least one of a formation, a strategy, and a character is changed through a user interface for changing at least one of the formation, the strategy, and the character, a client may regenerate scene data after a point in time when the change is made.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0134">A method of displaying a simulation result at a client and/or a highlight scene are described above with reference to <figref>FIGS. 1 through 8</figref> and thus, a further description related thereto is omitted here.</p>

In this example, the chemistry level may be set based on whether information about at least one of the nationality, the origin of league, and the origin of club is identical between two characters adjacent based on a formation of the team. As described above, according to an increase in the number of identical items among the nationality, the origin of league, and the origin of club, the chemistry level may also increase.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0159">In operation <b>2020</b>, the terminal may graphically display the relationship between characters on the screen based on the chemistry level. For example, the terminal may connect and thereby display, on the screen, the relationship between characters using a line having a different thickness or a different color based on a chemistry level between the characters. Although an example in which the relationship between characters is indicated using a line having a different thickness is described with reference to <figref>FIG. 19</figref>, the relationship between characters may be expressed using a variety of methods such as, for example, a method of applying a numerical level value to a different color or line.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0160">The game according to the exemplary embodiments of <figref>FIG. 20</figref> may also include a game in which a level-based league is configured for teams of users and a league game between teams belonging to the level-based league is performed at time intervals predetermined at a server regardless of whether the users connect to a game system.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0161">Also, at least one of a relationship between characters, a process about the progress of a game, and a result of the progress of the game may be displayed on a screen of a terminal through a webpage received from the server.</p>
