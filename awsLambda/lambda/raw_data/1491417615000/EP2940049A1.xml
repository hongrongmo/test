    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Polyvinylidene fluoride is excellent in such properties as heat resistance and chemical resistance. It also has a large differential between the melting point and the pyrolysis temperature, and thus is easy to process. Polyvinylidene fluoride is thus used in various applications.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Known methods of producing polyvinylidene fluoride or other fluoropolymers include emulsion polymerization, suspension polymerization, solution polymerization, and bulk polymerization. The emulsion polymerization is a method that includes polymerizing fluoromonomers in the presence of a surfactant to provide an aqueous dispersion of a fluoropolymer.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The surfactants conventionally used are perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), which could adversely affect the environment.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In such situation in the art, Patent Literature 1 discloses production of a fluoropolymer aqueous dispersion using a bifunctional fluorinated surfactant represented by the formula: A-R<sub>f</sub>-B (I) wherein A and B are the same as or different from each other, and are each -(O)<sub>p</sub>CFX-COOM (where M = NH<sub>4</sub>, an alkali metal, or H; X = F or CF<sub>3</sub>; p is 0 or an integer equal to 1); R<sub>f</sub> is a linear or branched perfluoroalkyl or (per)fluoropolyether chain that allows the surfactant of Formula (I) to have a number average molecular weight of 300 or 1,800, preferably 500 or 1,600, and more preferably 600 or 1,200.</p>
