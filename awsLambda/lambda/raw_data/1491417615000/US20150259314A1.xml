      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0046">The present invention shown by Process A is superior to publicly known manufacturing methods or synthetic intermediates, in points given below, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0047">(i) Concerning the production procedures of compound (IVb) of Process W and compound (VIb) of Process Z, since an acetamide group exists in their starting materials compound (IVa) and compound (VIa), N-methylation occurs as a side reaction. For example, with respect to compound (VIa), the N-methylated compound is generated at approximately 12% (refer to data of N-methylated compound of compound (VIa) described in Comparative Example 1).</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0048">In contrast, compound (7) has no functional group which may be methylated other than the hydroxyl group at the 1-position of the side chain, and thus N-methylation as a side reaction does not occur in the methylation reaction of compound (7). In addition, the oxazolidine ring of compound (7) simultaneously serves as a protective group to prevent N-methylation and as a partial structure which is to be converted into an acetamide group at the 5-position in Step A-6. Further, since compound (7) is a crystalline solid, it can easily be purified by recrystallization. Therefore, compound (7) contributes to the improvement of the overall yield in Process A, by achieving efficient methylation of the hydroxyl group at the 1-position of the side chain, and by achieving a reduction in the number of procedures in Process A.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0049">(ii) Concerning the production procedure of compound (IVg) in Process W, Process Y, and Process Z, since the reaction is carried out under a high temperature of 80Â° C. or higher using approximately 6 moles of sodium azide, it is extremely hazardous especially from an industrial perspective, when the explosive nature of azide compounds is taken into consideration. In addition, the stereoselectivity of the reaction at the 4-position is not enough, and thus the generation ratio of compound (IVg) and the undesired stereoisomer in which the azide group has the opposite configuration of compound (IVg), is approximately 7:1 (refer to Comparative Example 2).</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0050">In contrast, concerning the azidation reaction of compound (8), by using a Lewis acid, the amount of azidation agent used is reduced to approximately 1.5 to 2 equivalents, and the reaction proceeds under extremely mild conditions of 0Â° C. to 30Â° C. In addition, the stereoselectivity of the reaction at the 4-position is improved, and thus the generation ratio of compound (9) and the undesired stereoisomer is improved to 15:1 (refer to data described in Step A-6 of Example 1).</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0051">Accordingly, the manufacturing method of compound (9) from compound (8) improves the practicality of Process A from an industrial perspective, by achieving an improvement in the safety of the azidation reaction and stereoselective production of the desired isomer.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0052">(iii) Compound (IIIa) in Process Y and Process Z is a salt of trifluoroacetic acid which is corrosive, and is an amorphous solid, therefore being unable to be easily purified by recrystallization.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0053">In contrast, compound (13) is produced from compound (12), by a reaction with only water under mild conditions. In addition, since compound (13) is a crystalline solid, it can easily be purified by recrystallization. From an industrial perspective, it is extremely important to use a starting material with a purity as high as possible in the final procedure of the production, in order to obtain the desired compound with high purity. Therefore, compound (13) contributes to the production of compound (I) with high purity, by providing a starting material with high purity in the final procedure.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0054">(iv) Concerning the production procedure of compound (IVk) and compound (Ia) in Process W, (a) protection of a carboxyl group is necessary, (b) a 2,3-diacylated compound is generated as by-product, and (c) purification by silica gel column chromatography is required to remove the octanoic acid derived from the reagent. Here, as an acylation reaction of a hydroxyl group using an ortho ester, the following reaction is known (Carbohydrate Research, 1987, Vol. 167, pp. 77-86). R<sup>a </sup>represents a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4 </sub>alkyl group and the like. In the following reaction, the reactive functional group is a hydroxyl group only.</p>

        </chemistry>
      </p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0055">In contrast, no similar acylation reaction that proceeds in the presence of a nitrogen functional group (guanidyl group), which is considered to be more reactive, is known. In the production procedure of compound (I) from compound (13), an acylation reaction proceeds with a fine yield in the presence of a guanidyl group. In the present procedure, (aâ²) protection of a carboxyl group is unnecessary, (bâ²) selective mono-acylation proceeds, resulting in scarce generation of a 2,3-diacylated compound as a by-product and (câ²) removal of by-product derived from the reagent by silica gel column chromatography is not required. Therefore, the manufacturing method of compound (I) from compound (13) contributes largely to the production of compound (I) with high purity.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0056">(v) An acylation reaction of a hydroxyl group using an imino ester is not known to present date. The production procedure of compound (I) from compound (13) can also be conducted by using an imino ester compound (15) and a compound represented by the formula R<sup>7</sup>âOH, in place of an ortho ester compound (14). The production of compound (14) by a conventional method is very low in yield [refer to (vii) given below]. By using compound (15) directly, the inefficient production procedure of compound (14) from compound (15) can be omitted.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0057">(vi) Concerning the production procedure of compound (IVk) and compound (Ia) in Process W, compound (VII), which is a 2,3-diacylated compound, is generated as a by-product. Accordingly, a reduction in the amount of compound (VII) contained is required to obtain compound (Ia) with high purity (refer to Comparative Example 3).</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0058">In the production procedure of compound (I) from compound (13), selective monoacylation reaction can be achieved by using compound (14) or compound (15), and thus compound (I) in which the amount of compound (VII) contained is less to such an extent as to be practical, can be produced (refer to Step A-10 of Example 1).</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0059">Therefore, the manufacturing method of compound (I) from compound (13) contributes largely to the production of compound (I) with high purity.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0060">(vii) In the production of compound (14), when a compound represented by the formula R<sup>7</sup>âOH is used as a reagent and as a solvent to react with compound (15), following a publicly known method (Journal of American Chemical Society, 1942, vol. 64, pp. 1825-1827), the yield of compound (14) is approximately 35% to 50% (refer to Comparative Example 4).</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0061">In contrast, when compound (15) is allowed to react with a compound represented by the formula R<sup>7</sup>âOH in a solvent which forms a bilayer system, the yield of compound (14) is improved remarkably to approximately 80% to 85% (refer to Example 9). Therefore, the manufacturing method of compound (14) from compound (15) contributes to the improvement of the overall yield of Process A, by providing an efficient method of manufacturing compound (14), which is used in the production of compound (I).</p>
