    </heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In a smelting reduction iron-making method, a reducing furnace for reducing iron ore and a melter-gasifier for melting reduced iron ore are used. In the case of melting iron ores in the melter-gasifier, as a heat source to melt iron ores, coal briquettes are charged into the melter-gasifier. Here, reduced iron is melted in the melter-gasifier, transformed to molten iron and slag, and then discharged outside. The coal briquettes charged into the melter-gasifier form a coal-packed bed. After oxygen is injected through a tuyere installed at the melter-gasifier, the coal-packed bed is combusted to generate combustion gas. The combustion gas is transformed into a hot reducing gas while rising through the coal-packed bed. The hot reducing gas is discharged outside the melter-gasifier to be supplied to the reducing furnace as the reducing gas.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In the case of using the coal briquettes, additional control means is necessary to make a process for manufacturing molten iron efficient by increasing yield of molten iron and reducing fuel ratio. To this end, differentiation capacity in the melter-gasifier of the coal briquettes is reduced and thus the coal briquettes in the melter-gasifier need to be maintained with a large grain size. In this case, reaction efficiency and heat-transfer efficiency between materials may increase by ensuring permeability and flow so that gas and liquid smoothly pass through the melter-gasifier. Further, a generation amount of fine powder which is not efficiently used due to differentiation during manufacture of molten iron may be reduced. There is a limitation in reduction of generating amount of fine powers by mixing of various kinds of coals.</p>

As those skilled in the art would realize, the described embodiments may be modified in various different ways, all without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention.</p>

Further, it is understood that graphite includes both natural graphite and graphite manufactured artificially.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">
      <figref>FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a flowchart of a method for manufacturing coal briquettes according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The method for manufacturing coal briquettes in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is just to exemplify the present invention, and the present invention is not limited thereto. Accordingly, the method for manufacturing coal briquettes may be variously modified.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the method for manufacturing coal briquettes includes providing powdered coal (S10), providing graphite (S20), providing a hardening agent and a binder (S30), providing a mixture by mixing the powdered coal, the graphite, the hardening agent, and the binder (S40), and providing coal briquettes by molding the mixture (S50). In addition, if necessary, the method for manufacturing coal briquettes may further include other processes.</p>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">First, in step S10, the powdered coal is supplied. The powdered coal may be supplied by separating raw coals according to a grain size. For example, raw coal with a grain size of 8mm or less may be supplied as the powdered coal. That is, the raw coals are separated according to a grain size to be sorted into powdered coal having a small grain size and lump coal having a large grain size. Coal briquettes having excellent cold strength may be manufacture by using powdered coal having a small grain size as the raw coal. The lump coal which is raw coal with a grain size of more than 8mm may be directly charged into the melter-gasifier or crushed to be used. Meanwhile, although not illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, in order to improve the quality of molten iron, coal for quality control may be mixed with the powdered coal. Here, as the coal for quality control, coal with reflectance of a predetermined value or more may be used.</p>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Next, in step S20, the graphite is provided. As the graphite, natural graphite, crystalline graphite, kish graphite, and the like may be used. Here, the kish graphite is discharged as a by-product of an iron making process. A grain diameter and strength of char generated by charging coal briquettes into the melter-gasifier are improved by adding the graphite to the coal briquettes. The coal included in the coal briquettes charged into the melter-gasifier is differentiated while a crack is generated by shrinkage and swelling thereof. Accordingly, in order to prevent generation and propagation of the crack, thermally stable graphite is added to the coal briquettes. Since the graphite is thermally stable, it stably exists during swelling and contraction of coals in the coal briquettes. Accordingly, since the graphite plays a role similar to an aggregate used in making concrete or mortar, the coal briquettes may be efficiently prevented from being differentiated at a high temperature by the graphite.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The grain diameter of char of the coal briquettes increases by adding graphite. The increasing of the grain diameter of char means that the hot strength of the coal briquettes is improved because the coal briquettes are not differentiated well in the melter-gasifier. The graphite is composed of carbon, and in the graphite, a hexagonal benzene-ring structure is very well developed as compared with other coal. That is, as a polycyclic carbon structure close to the graphite is developed, a capacity to transfer electrons or heat in the coal briquettes rapidly increases by the polycyclic carbon structure in a plane. Heat conductivity of the coal increases as the degree of coalification increases. For example, heat conductivity (Î»: WÂ·m<sup>-1</sup>Â·K<sup>-1</sup>) of bituminous coal which is used mainly for iron making is 1 or slightly higher than 1. In contrast, heat conductivity of graphite has several tens of times higher value than that of bituminous coal. That is, the graphite has a very high heat transfer rate. The coal briquettes are differentiated at a high temperature by a heat transfer characteristic. That is, when a reaction in which the coal briquettes are pyrolyzed to generate char is divided into many steps, in the coal briquettes at room temperature charged into the hot melter-gasifier, a heat transfer phenomenon from the surface to the inside thereof occurs. Accordingly, even in the case where a surface portion of coal briquettes reaches a high temperature of 1000Â°C, the inside of the coal briquettes exists at a temperature much lower than 1000Â°C. A difference in temperature between the inside and the outside of the coal briquettes causes a difference in contraction ratio, and cracks occur due to the difference in contraction ratio for each portion of the coal briquettes. Accordingly, finally, char having a small grain diameter is manufactured. That is, as a temperature difference increases, a differentiation phenomenon increases.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">When a graphite with high heat conductivity and a very low thermal expansion rate is added to the coal briquettes, a temperature difference in the coal briquettes is reduced. That is, when the graphite is added, the temperature of the entire coal briquettes is further uniformalized. Accordingly, since the cracks may be suppressed according to a change in a contraction rate due to the temperature difference of the coal briquettes, the coal briquettes are not differentiated into small pieces but exist with a large grain diameter. Further, even if the crack occurs in the char, thermally stable graphite suppresses the crack from being propagated. Accordingly, even when the coal briquettes are drastically heated, the coal briquettes are differentiated into large grains or char maintaining the shape of the coal briquettes as it is can be manufactured. In the case of manufacturing the coal briquettes by adding graphite according to the aforementioned principle, the grain diameter of char obtained from the coal briquettes which are drastically pyrolyzed is great and the strength thereof is also high.</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Meanwhile, the graphite is pressure-transported by a gas and may be stored in a graphite storage bin. Here, in order to prevent the ignition of the graphite, nitrogen or a by-product gas may be used as the gas. When the coal briquettes are manufactured, the graphite stored in the graphite storage bin may be sent out to be used.</p>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Next, in step S30, the hardening agent and the binder are provided. As the hardening agent, quicklime, slaked lime, a metal oxide, fly ash, clay, a surface active agent, a cationic resin, an accelerator, fiber, phosphate, sludge, waste plastics, waste lubricating oil, and the like may be used. Further, as the binder, molasses, starch, sugar, a polymer resin, pitch, tar, bitumen, oil, cement, asphalt, water glass, or the like may be used. For example, when the coal briquettes are manufactured by using molasses as the binder and quicklime as the hardening agent, the cold strength of coal briquettes may be largely increased by a saccharate bond.</p>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Next, in step S40, the mixture is provided by mixing the powdered coal, the graphite, the hardening agent, and the binder. Here, the powdered coal, the graphite, the hardening agent, and the binder may be mixed in a random order or specific materials among those may be first mixed. For example, after the powdered coals and the graphite are first mixed, the binder may be mixed and then the hardening agent may be mixed. Alternatively, the graphite may be directly mixed with the hardening agent and the binder while being not mixed with the powdered coals in advance. That is, since dried coke dust in the graphite does not need to be mixed with the powdered coal in advance by controlling a water amount included therein, the graphite may be directly mixed with the hardening agent and the binder.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">When a large amount of graphite is added to the coal briquettes, a usage amount of molasses or bitumen as the binder needs to increase in order to bind the graphite and the powdered coal. That is, as the amount of graphite increases, the amount of binder needs to increase. In the case of adding the graphite while the amount of binder is small, it is difficult to mold the coal briquettes and the room-temperature strength of the coal briquettes is lowered. Accordingly, when the coal briquettes are transported or stored, the coal briquettes are differentiated. That is, when the amount of the binder is too little or too great, the cold strength of the coal briquettes deteriorates. Accordingly, the amount of the binder included in the mixture is controlled in the aforementioned range. For example, the amount of the binder included in the mixture may be controlled to 8.5wt% to 9wt%.</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Meanwhile, although not illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the raw coal is manufactured by mixing the powdered coal and the graphite in advance and then may be mixed with the hardening agent and the binder. The manufactured raw coals may be separated into coals with a predetermined grain size or more. In addition, the grain size of the raw coal may be controlled to be suitable for manufacturing the coal briquettes by crushing the sorted raw coals. That is, the powdered coals and the graphite are crushed to be provided as the raw coal.</p>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">A ratio of the amount of graphite to the sum of the amount of powdered coal and the amount of graphite may be greater than 0 and 0.3 or less. When the amount of graphite is too great, the cold strength of the coal briquettes is lowered. Accordingly, the amount of graphite is controlled in the aforementioned range. More preferably, the ratio of the amount of graphite to the sum of the amount of powdered coals and the amount of graphite may be 0.1 to 0.15.</p>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Finally, in step S50, the coal briquettes are provided by molding the mixture. For example, the coal briquettes may be manufactured by continuously compacting the mixture by using a molding machine including a pair of rollers.</p>
    <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The coal briquettes include carbons. Accordingly, when an X-ray diffraction analysis of the coal briquettes is performed, the coal briquettes have X-ray peak 2Î¸ at 26Â° to 27Â°. Preferably, the coal briquettes have X-ray peak 2Î¸ at 26.6Â°.</p>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Generally, a method of improving the hot strength of the coal briquettes by using the binder such as bitumen has been attempted. However, since the coal briquettes are differentiated at a high temperature, efficient means and methods capable of increasing the grain diameter and the strength of the char are required. Further, even though coal is changed in its type, it is difficult to improve the hot strength of the coal briquettes.</p>
    <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">
      <figref>FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrates a apparatus for manufacturing coal briquettes 100 according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The apparatus for manufacturing coal briquettes 100 in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is just to exemplify the present invention, and the present invention is not limited thereto. Accordingly, a structure of the apparatus for manufacturing coal briquettes 100 may be variously modified.</p>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the apparatus for manufacturing coal briquettes 100 includes a powdered coal storage bin 10, a coal for quality control storage bin 20, a graphite storage bin 30, a binder storage bin 40, a hardening agent storage bin 50, a mixer 60, and a molding machine 70. In addition, the apparatus for manufacturing coal briquettes 100 further includes a crusher 80, a mixed coal storage bin 92, a collected coal storage bin 94, a graphite transport pipe 303, a graphite carrying device 305, and separators 801, 803, and 805. If necessary, the apparatus for manufacturing coal briquettes 100 may further include other devices. Since a detailed structure and an operation method of respective devices included in the apparatus for manufacturing coal briquettes 100 of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> can be easily understood by those skilled in the art, the detailed description is omitted.</p>
    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The powdered coal is stored in the powdered coal storage bin 10. In addition, the coal for quality control may be used in order to improve the quality of the coal briquettes and are stored in the coal for quality control storage bin 20. The coal passes through the separator 801 to be divided into lump coal and powdered coal, and then the powdered coal may be stored in the powdered coal storage bin 10. For example, coal with a grain size of 8 mm or less may be used as powdered coal. Meanwhile, the lump coal separated by the separator 801 may be directly charged into a melter-gasifier 210 (illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the graphite storage bin 30 stores the graphite supplied from the graphite carrying device 305 through the graphite transport pipe 303. For example, a tank lorry and the like may be used as the graphite carrying device 305. The graphite is pressure-transported by a gas and stored to be supplied in the graphite storage bin 30 from the graphite carrying device 305. In this case, nitrogen or a by-product gas is used as the gas to prevent ignition of the graphite. The by-product gas is a gas generated during a process in a steel mill. The graphite is directly mixed with the hardening agent and the binder without being mixed with the powdered coal in advance.</p>
    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Meanwhile, in order to prevent abrasion by the graphite during transport, the graphite transport pipe 303 may be used by manufacturing the pipe itself with a specific material or coating an inner side of the pipe with basalt or the like. Since the graphite is stored and transported in a large sack, it is preferred that the graphite is loaded for being used in the graphite carrying device 305, but the graphite may be stored in the graphite storage bin 30 by directly removing the sack.</p>
    <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The mixed coal is separated in the separator 803 and the mixed coal with a predetermined grain size or more is crushed by the crusher 80. The crushed mixed coal and the mixed coal with less than a predetermined grain size are stored in the mixed coal storage bin 92. The mixed coal stored in the mixed coal storage bin 92 is provided to the mixer 60.</p>
    <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the binder is stored in the binder storage bin 40. The binder binds the powdered coal and the graphite to each other to be made into a state suitable for manufacturing the coal briquettes. The binder storage bin 40 is connected with the mixer 60 to provide the binder thereto.</p>
    <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Meanwhile, the hardening agent is stored in the hardening agent storage bin 50. The hardening agent is coupled with the powdered coal, the graphite, and the binder to harden the coal briquettes and thus the strength of coal briquettes may be optimized. The hardening agent storage bin 50 is connected with the mixer 60 to provide the hardening agent to the mixer 60.</p>
    <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The mixer 60 mixes the powdered coal, the graphite, the binder, the hardening agent, and the like with each other to provide the mixture for manufacturing the coal briquettes. Meanwhile, the graphite storage bin 30 is directly connected with the mixer 60 to provide the graphite to the mixer 60. Since the water and the grain size of the graphite are controlled, the graphite may be immediately used in the mixer 60.</p>
    <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the molding machine 70 includes a pair of rolls that rotate in opposite direction to each other. The mixture is compacted by the pair of rolls by providing the mixture therebetween to manufacture the coal briquettes. Meanwhile, the powdered coal is stored in the collected coal storage bin 94 by separating the manufactured coal briquettes through the separator 805 again. The powdered coal stored in the collected coal storage bin 94 is re-supplied to the mixer 60 again to be used as a raw material of the coal briquettes. As a result, use efficiency of the powdered coal may be improved.</p>

The coal briquettes are charged into the dome part 2101 of the melter-gasifier 210 and then rapidly heated to fall down to the lower portion of the melter-gasifier 210. Char generated by a pyrolysis reaction of the coal briquettes moves to the lower portion of the melter-gasifier 210 to exothermic-react with oxygen supplied through a tuyere 230. As a result, the coal briquettes may be used as a heat source which keeps the melter-gasifier 210 at a high temperature.

    <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Hot quality of coal briquettes manufactured by adding crystalline graphite and kish graphite was excellent. Coal briquettes manufactured by adding graphite were different from coal briquettes without adding graphite in terms of carbon crystallinity. This could be seen through an X-ray diffractometry result. That is, 2Î¸ value of carbon included in coal was exhibited at approximately 21 degrees, and as the degree of coalification is increased, the 2Î¸ value is finely increased.</p>
    <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">However, in the coal briquettes adding graphite, a peak was exhibited around 26.6 degrees. A characteristic of the coal briquettes manufactured according to experimental examples of the present invention by using a crystal characteristic of the graphite could be seen. In this case, since SiO<sub>2</sub> among minerals configuring coal had a peak in a range close to the graphite, in order to observe the peak of only the graphite, impurities included in the coal briquettes were removed by pre-processing. A sample of the coal briquettes which are ground to 63<i>Âµ</i>m or less were eluted at 50 Â°C for 3 hours and then washed using distilled water. Next, in order to remove SiO<sub>2</sub>, the coal briquettes was secondarily acid-treated for 3 hours again in a hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution at 48% heated at 50Â°C, washed using distilled water, and then dried to manufacture a sample for analysis. In addition, an X-ray diffraction analysis was performed by using a copper (CU) target at a speed of 1 degree/min with an acceleration voltage of 20kV at 100mA.</p>
