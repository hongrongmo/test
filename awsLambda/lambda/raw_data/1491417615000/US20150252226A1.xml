      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a functionalized Î±-olefin polymer and to a curable composition and a cured product using it.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Recently, there is growing a rise in the awareness of global environmental issues, and working conditions, safety and health for workers. In that situation, for example, already-existing adhesives have a melting point of 150Â° C. or higher and need heat, and therefore substances capable of realizing low-temperature application are desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In use of adhesives, more reactive materials are desired; and in use of reactive adhesives (epoxy resin-based, polyurethane-based, polyamide-based), sealants, sealing materials, adhesives, plasticizers and the like, desired are well-handleable and high-reactive materials and reactivity-controllable materials. From the viewpoint of improving heat resistance and improving waterproofness, needs for olefinic materials are increasing.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">For such olefinic materials, PTLs 1 to 3 have tried graphitization through contact of a polyolefin and an alkoxysilane in the presence of an organic peroxide.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">However, the olefinic materials disclosed in PTLs 1 to 3 are produced using a substrate having a high melting point, and therefore have some problems in that, when the material is mixed with a curing-accelerating catalyst and then crosslinked with moisture or the like, the material could not be flowable at room temperature and therefore could not be reacted when a solvent is not used, or the resultant cured product would be too hard and is poorly practicable.</p>

      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The functionalized Î±-olefin polymer of the present invention includes three types of a functionalized propylene homopolymer produced by functionalizing a propylene homopolymer, a functionalized propylene-1-butene copolymer produced by functionalizing a propylene-1-butene copolymer, and a functionalized 1-butene homopolymer produced by functionalizing a 1-butene homopolymer. âFunctionalizationâ in the present description means adding an alkoxysilane to an Î±-olefin polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The functionalized Î±-olefin polymer in the present invention is excellent in adhesiveness to polyolefin materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Copolymerization with a comonomer such as ethylene or the like may increase the crystalline component to lose flowability at room temperature or to worsen handleability, and therefore the polymer would hardly cure at room temperature and would be difficult to use as a base material for adhesives, pressure-sensitive adhesives or sealing materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The functionalized Î±-olefin polymer of the present invention preferably exhibits flowability at room temperature. Concretely, the functionalized Î±-olefin polymer of the present invention exhibits flowability at a relatively low temperature of 100Â° C. or lower, and more preferably exhibits flowability at a low temperature of 60Â° C. or lower.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0000">(Meso-Pentad Fraction [mmmm])</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0026">In the case where the functionalized Î±-olefin polymer of the present invention is a functionalized propylene homopolymer or a functionalized 1-butene homopolymer, the meso-pentad fraction [mmmm] thereof is less than 20 mol %, preferably from more than 1 mol % to less than 15 mol %, more preferably from more than 1 mol % to less than 10 mol %, even more preferably from more than 1 mol % to less than 5 mol %.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0027">In the case where the functionalized Î±-olefin polymer of the present invention is a functionalized propylene-1-butene copolymer, the meso-diad fraction [m] thereof is less than 95 mol %, preferably from 30 to 95 mol %, more preferably from 30 to 80 mol %, even more preferably from 30 to 70 mol %. In the case of the functionalized propylene-1-butene copolymer, the structure of the meso-diad fraction [m] can be specified for the reason that the peak of each comonomer does not overlap with each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0028">The meso-pentad fraction [mmmm] and the meso-diad fraction [m] can be controlled by the structure of the main catalyst and the polymerization condition.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0029">Controlling the index of stereoregularity, meso-pentad fraction [mmmm] to be less than 20 mol % can be realized by the structure of the main catalyst and the polymerization condition. For example, for controlling by the structure of catalyst, the space where the monomer coordinates with the center metal of the catalyst must be planned to be a suitable size. Depending on the size of the coordination space, monomer insertion would be difficult and the activity of the catalyst would be thereby lowered, and a catalyst having a racemic structure gives a polymer having a high regularity, and the polymer may have a meso-pentad fraction [mmmm] of 20 mol % or more. A catalyst having a meso-structure tends to give a polymer having a low regularity, and the polymer may have a meso-pentad fraction [mmmm] of less than 20 mol %; however, the above-mentioned 2,1-insertion tends to occur, and it is difficult to produce a polymer satisfying a balance of bonding ratio and stereoregularity. For example, using the double-crosslinked catalyst described in this application makes it possible to control the coordination space for the monomer and to produce a polymer satisfying the balance of bonding ratio and stereoregularity.</p>
