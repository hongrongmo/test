      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to methods for the structural modification of the sesquiterpene lactone, parthenolide, and the use of these parthenolide derivatives in the treatment of carcinoma. More specifically, the invention relates to the methods to prepare structural analogs of the parent compound, parthenolide, in order to obtain new, pharmacologically active chemical entities with improved water solubility characteristics, and to use them in the treatment of leukemias and other parental and multi-drug resistant cancers</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Sesquiterpene lactones are a group of secondary plant metabolites consisting of a 15-carbon structure containing an Î±-methylene-Î³-butyrolactone moiety and other additional functional groups. Over the last two to three decades, these terpenoids have received considerable attention due to the broad spectrum of their biological activities, to the plants which produce them, and most importantly, because of their pharmacological effects in humans. About 4,000 of these terpenoids have been isolated and identified, most of them in Asteraceae (Compositae, sunflower family) (Schmidt, <i>Curr. Org. Chem. </i>1999, 3, 577-608). Some of these plants have been used for centuries in indigenous medical practices in various cultures worldwide.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Parthenolide (1) is a Germacrane sesquiterpene lactone with a unique structure. It has been isolated from several different species in Asteraceae (Compositae) family, feverfew (<i>Tanacetum parthenium</i>) being one of them.</p>

        </chemistry>
      </p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0005">Feverfew has been used to reduce fever and pain and in the treatment of migraine and rheumatoid arthritis (Heptinstall et al., ACS Symposium Series (1998), 691 (Phytomedicines of Europe), 158-175). The active component is parthenolide (1). Recently, it has been revealed that parthenolide (1) can induce tumor apoptosis by the inhibition of NF-ÎºB activities (Cory et al., <i>Anticancer Research </i>2002, 22, 3805-9; Cory et al., <i>Anticancer Research </i>2001, 21, 3807-11; Gelfanov et al., <i>Blood, </i>2000, 98, 2508-17; Kang et al, <i>Brit. J. Pharmacol. </i>2002, 135, 1235-44; Song et al., <i>J. Asian. Nat. Prod. Res. </i>2001, 3, 285-91).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0006">Parthenolide (1) is a lipophilic, neutral lactone with low polarity, and has a low water-solubility, limiting its development as a therapeutic agent. Thus, a need exists for the development of soluble parthenolide derivatives that retain their anti-cancer activity.</p>

The use of masking agents is common and well-known in the art and, in particular, masking phosphate or phosphonate groups. All such masking agents are suitable and can be used with the compounds of the invention. Various agents such as acyloxy alkyl esters are described by Srivasta et al., (1984 <i>Bioorganic Chemistry </i>12, 118-12), and by Freeman et al. (1997 <i>Progress in Medicinal Chemistry </i>34:112-147) which are each incorporated in their entirety herein by reference; and 3-phthalidyl phosphonate esters are described by Dang Q., et al., (1999 <i>Bioorganic </i>&amp; <i>Med. Chem Letters, </i>9:1505-1510), which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. For example, and not by way of limitation, Srivasta et al. also describe acetoxymethyl, isobutryloxymethyl, and pivaloxymethyl as masking agents. Other suitable masking groups comprising pivaloxyalkyl, e.g., pivaloxymethyl, or a pivaloyloxy group as described by Farquhar D. et al., (1995 <i>J. Med. Chem., </i>38:488-495) which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. Still other masking or protecting agents are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,816,570 and 4,968,788 both of which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference. Lipid prodrugs are also suitable for use with the compounds of the invention. By non-limiting example, certain lipid prodrugs are described in Hostetler et al., (1997 <i>Biochem. Pharm. </i>53:1815-1822), and Hostetler et al., 1996 <i>Antiviral Research </i>31:59-67), both of which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.

Such prodrugs may also possess the ability to target the drug compound to a particular tissue within the patient, e.g., liver, as described by Erion et al., (2004 <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>126:5154-5163; Erion et al., <i>Am. Soc. Pharm</i>. &amp; <i>Exper. Ther. DOI:</i>10.1124/jept.104.75903 (2004); WO 01/18013 A1; U.S. Pat. No. 6,752,981), each of which is incorporated in their entirety herein by reference. By way of non-limiting example, other prodrugs suitable for use with the compounds of the invention are described in WO 03/090690; and by Harris et al., (2002 <i>Antiviral Chem </i>&amp; <i>Chemo. </i>12: 293-300; Knaggs et al., 2000 <i>Bioorganic </i>&amp; <i>Med. Chem Letters </i>10: 2075-2078) each of which is incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0050">The invention relates to the ability of the Î±-methylene-Î³-butyrolactone moiety in sesquiterpene lactones to be structurally modified by, for example, Michael addition with amines or thiols. Modification of the parthenolide (1) molecule by this methodology using primary and/or secondary amines to form water-soluble amino derivatives, affords amine adducts that can easily be obtained as different inorganic or organic salts to further increase water solubility. Thus, a novel class of more water-soluble parthenolide analogs is described. When compounds in this class were evaluated for antileukemic activity, it was found that these compounds were either equipotent as, or more potent than the parent compound, parthenolide. More importantly, these novel analogs showed greater cytotoxicity towards leukemia cells than towards normal cells. Thus, the present invention provides a new class of parthenolide derivatives with potent and selective anticancer activities.</p>

      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0119">The compounds described herein are useful for treating cancer. Cancers treatable by the present therapy include the solid and hematological tumors, such as prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, brain cancer and hepatic cancer, comprising administering to a mammal afflicted with said cancer an amount of parthenolide derivative effective to inhibit the viability of cancer cells of said mammal. The parthenolide derivative may be administered as primary therapy, or as adjunct therapy, either following local intervention (surgery, radiation, local chemotherapy) or in conjunction with at least one other chemotherapeutic agent discussed hereinabove, as well as the solid tumors disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,514,555. Hematological cancers, such as the leukemias are disclosed in the Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, D. E. Larson, ed., William Morrow, N.Y. (1990) and include CLL, ALL, CML and the like. Compounds of the present invention may be used in bone marrow transplant procedure to treat bone marrow prior to reintroduction to the patient. In addition, the compounds of the present invention may be used as chemotherapy sensitizers or radiation therapy sensitizers. Accordingly, a patient, or cells, or tissues, derived from a cancer patient, are pre-treated with the compounds prior to standard chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The present invention contemplates that parthenolide may also be used in such methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0120">Within another aspect of the present invention, methods are provided for inhibiting angiogenesis in patients with non-tumorigenic, angiogenesis-dependent diseases, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising parthenolide derivative to a patient with a non-tumorigenic angiogenesis-dependent disease, such that the formation of new blood vessels is inhibited. Within other aspects, methods are provided for inhibit reactive proliferation of endothelial cells or capillary formation in non-tumorigenic, angiogenesis-dependent diseases, such that the blood vessel is effectively occluded. Within one embodiment, the anti-angiogenic composition comprising parthenolide derivative is delivered to a blood vessel which is actively proliferating and nourishing a tumor.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0121">In addition to tumors, numerous other non-tumorigenic angiogenesis-dependent diseases, which are characterized by the abnormal growth of blood vessels, may also be treated with the anti-angiogenic parthenolide derivative compositions, or anti-angiogenic factors of the present invention. Anti-angiogenic parthenolide derivative compositions of the present invention can block the stimulatory effects of angiogenesis promoters, reducing endothelial cell division, decreasing endothelial cell migration, and impairing the activity of the proteolytic enzymes secreted by the endothelium. Representative examples of such non-tumorigenic angiogenesis-dependent diseases include corneal neovascularization, hypertrophic scars and keloids, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, arteriovenous malformations, atherosclerotic plaques, delayed wound healing, hemophilic joints, nonunion fractures, Osler-Weber syndrome, psoriasis, pyogenic granuloma, scleroderma, trachoma, menorrhagia, retrolental fibroplasia and vascular adhesions. The pathology and treatment of these conditions is disclosed in detail in published PCT application PCT/CA94/00373 (WO 95/03036), at pages 26-36. Topical or directed local administration of the present compositions is often the preferred mode of administration of therapeutically effective amounts of parthenolide derivative, i.e., in depot or other controlled release forms.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0122">Anti-angiogenic compositions of the present invention may also be utilized in a variety of other manners. For example, they may be incorporated into surgical sutures in order to prevent stitch granulomas, implanted in the uterus (in the same manner as an IUD) for the treatment of menorrhagia or as a form of female birth control, administered as either a peritoneal lavage fluid or for peritoneal implantation in the treatment of endometriosis, attached to a monoclonal antibody directed against activated endothelial cells as a form of systemic chemotherapy, or utilized in diagnostic imaging when attached to a radioactively labelled monoclonal antibody which recognizes active endothelial cells. The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of parthenolide derivative, an analog thereof or a combination thereof, in the acute or chronic management of cancer, i.e., prostate or breast cancer, will vary with the stage of the cancer, such as the solid tumor to be treated, the chemotherapeutic agent(s) or other anti-cancer therapy used, and the route of administration. The dose, and perhaps the dose frequency, will also vary according to the age, body weight, and response of the individual patient. In general, the total daily dose range for parthenolide derivative and its analogs, for the conditions described herein, is from about 0.5 mg to about 2500 mg, in single or divided doses. Preferably, a daily dose range should be about 1 mg to about 100 mg, in single or divided doses, most preferably about 5-50 mg per day. In managing the patient, the therapy should be initiated at a lower dose and increased depending on the patient's global response. It is further recommended that infants, children, patients over 65 years, and those with impaired renal or hepatic function initially receive lower doses, and that they be titrated based on global response and blood level. It may be necessary to use dosages outside these ranges in some cases. Further, it is noted that the clinician or treating physician will know how and when to interrupt, adjust or terminate therapy in conjunction with individual patient response. The terms âan effective amountâ or âan effective sensitizing amountâ are encompassed by the above-described dosage amounts and dose frequency schedule.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0123">Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing the patient with an effective dosage of parthenolide derivative (e.g., oral, sublingual, rectal, intravenous, epidural, intrethecal, subcutaneous, transcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracutaneous, inhalation, transdermal, nasal spray, nasal gel or drop, and the like). While it is possible that, for use in therapy, parthenolide derivative or its analogs may be administered as the pure chemicals, as by inhalation of a fine powder via an insufflator, it is preferable to present the active ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation. The invention thus further provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising parthenolide derivative or an analog thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers therefor and, optionally, other therapeutic and/or prophylactic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be âacceptableâ in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof, such as a human patient or domestic animal.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0124">Pharmaceutical formulations include those suitable for oral or parenteral (including intramuscular, subcutaneous and intravenous) administration. Forms suitable for parenteral administration also include forms suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation or for nasal, or topical (including buccal, rectal, vaginal and sublingual) administration. The formulations may, where appropriate, be conveniently presented in discrete unit dosage forms and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with liquid carriers, solid matrices, semi-solid carriers, finely divided solid carriers or combinations thereof, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired delivery system.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0125">Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete unit dosage forms such as hard or soft gelatin capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or as granules; as a solution, a suspension or as an emulsion; or in a chewable base such as a synthetic resin or chicle for ingestion of the agent from a chewing gum. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, lubricants, disintegrants, or wetting agents. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in the art, i.e., with enteric coatings.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0126">Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), or preservatives.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0127">The compounds according to the invention may also be formulated for parenteral administration (e.g., by injection, for example, bolus injection or continuous infusion) and may be presented in unit dose form in ampules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion containers or in multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilization from solution, for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0128">For topical administration to the epidermis, the compounds may be formulated as ointments, creams or lotions, or as the active ingredient of a transdermal patch. Suitable transdermal delivery systems are disclosed, for example, in A. Fisher et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,788,603), or R. Bawa et al. (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,931,279; 4,668,506 and 4,713,224). Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilizing agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or coloring agents.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0129">Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include unit dosage forms such as lozenges comprising active ingredient in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia; mucoadherent gels, and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0130">When desired, the above-described formulations can be adapted to give sustained release of the active ingredient employed, e.g., by combination with certain hydrophilic polymer matrices, e.g., comprising natural gels, synthetic polymer gels or mixtures thereof. The polymer matrix can be coated onto, or used to form, a medical prosthesis, such as a stent, valve, shunt, graft, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0131">Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for rectal administration wherein the carrier is a solid are most preferably presented as unit dose suppositories. Suitable carriers include cocoa butter and other materials commonly used in the art, and the suppositories may be conveniently formed by admixture of the active compound with the softened or melted carrier(s) followed by chilling and shaping in molds.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0132">Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0133">For administration by inhalation, the compounds according to the invention are conveniently delivered from an insufflator, nebulizer or a pressurized pack or other convenient means of delivering an aerosol spray. Pressurized packs may comprise a suitable propellant such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0134">Alternatively, for administration by inhalation or insufflation, the compounds according to the invention may take the form of a dry powder composition, for example, a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. The powder composition may be presented in unit dosage form in, for example, capsules or cartridges or, e.g., gelatin or blister packs from which the powder may be administered with the aid of an inhalator or insufflator.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0135">For intra-nasal administration, the compounds of the invention may be administered via a liquid spray, such as via a plastic bottle atomizer. Typical of these are the MistometerÂ® (Wintrop) and the MedihalerÂ® (Riker).</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0136">For topical administration to the eye, the compounds can be administered as drops, gels (U.S. Pat. No. 4,255,415), gums (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,136,177) or via a prolonged-release ocular insert.</p>

      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0146">For apoptosis analysis, one million primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells were washed with cold PBS and resuspended in 200 microliters of Annexin binding buffer (10 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.4; 140 mM NaCl; 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Annexin V-FITC (Pharmingen) and 0.25 mg/mL 7-AAD (7-aminoactinomycin D, Molecular Probes, CA) were added and the tubes were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 minutes. Cells were then diluted with 200 microliters of Annexin binding buffer and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry. Viable cells were identified as failing to label with Annexin V or 7-AAD. Cells beginning to die label with Annexin V, and as membrane integrity is lost, will also label with 7-AAD. For each parthenolide derivative, the</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0000">percentage of viable cells was determined after 24 hours of culture at a 10 micromolar concentration. Data are normalized to untreated control specimens. The data are in Table 1 for aminoparthenolide derivatives and Table 2 for the salts of some aminoparthenolides.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0147">Healthy human bone marrow cells were used in the above assay to test the cytotoxicity of parthenolide. Eighty-five percent of the normal cells survived 10 Î¼M of parthenolide. All the aminoparthenolides evaluated afforded results similar to parthenolide, i.e. the survival rate of healthy human bone marrow cells was over 85% at a concentration of 10 Î¼M.</p>

      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0148">To assess the effect of parthenolide on primary human stem cell populations, experiments were conducted using transplantation into immune deficient NOD/SCID mice. Successful engraftment of NOD/SCID bone marrow at 6-8 weeks post-transplant has been shown to be a measure of stem cell content for human hematopoietic cell populations (Lapidot et al., <i>J Mol Med. </i>1997; 75: 664-673; Dick, <i>Curr Opin Hematol. </i>1996; 3:405-409). For each experiment, cryopreserved mononuclear cell specimens from normal or AML donors were thawed, and treated in vitro with 7.5 micromolar parthenolide for 12-18 hours. Following culture, 5-10 million cells/animal were injected intravenously into sublethally irradiated (300 Rad) NOD/SCID mice. After 6-8 weeks, animals were sacrificed and bone marrow was analyzed for the presence of human cells using flow cytometry as previously described (Guzman et al., <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>2002; 99: 16220-162253). Human specific antibodies for CD45 were used to assess the level of total engraftment.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0149">In three independent experiments, the level of engraftment for parthenolide-treated AML cells was dramatically reduced, which indicates a direct effect on the AML stem cell compartment. In contrast, no reduction in engraftment was detected for parthenolide-treated normal specimens, thus showing the parthenolide does not target normal hematopoietic stem cells. Similarly, treatment of AML cells with 7.5 micromolar DMAPT also yielded a strong reduction in NOD/SCID engraftment while treatment of normal cells showed no significant effects.</p>

      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0150">A 96-well U-bottomed plate (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) at a concentration of 5,000 cells per 50 microliters (mL) of media was incubated in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37Â° C. for 24 hours. Varying compound concentrations in 50 mL of media were added to the media 24 hours later. Colorimetric readings were obtained using the MTS/PMS system and an ELISA plate reader, after 48 hours of exposure to DMAPT. The readings obtained for each concentration tested were from an average of eight wells. Each experiment was expressed as a percentage of the solvent control and completed at least three times with consistent results. The results presented are an average of three experiments. The hormone refractory prostate cancer cell line CWR22Rv1 was treated with increasing concentrations of parthenolide and DMAPT. for three hours Both parthenolide and DMAPT reduced cellular proliferation by 50% at 5 Î¼m in the CWR22 MTS-PMS assay. Cellular proliferation was also measured in the MTS-PMS assay using four lung cancer cell lines treated with parthenolide and derivatives PIPT ((11S,11,13-dihydro,13-(piperidin-1-yl)parthenolide), 4MEPT (11S,11,13-dihydro,13-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)parthenolide) and MAPT (11S,11,13-dihydro,13-dimethylaminoparthenolide). Parthenolide and its derivatives inhibited cellular proliferation in a dose dependent manner between 2 and 10 Î¼M with 70% inhibition at 10 Î¼M in A549, 50% in H460, 40% in H-23 and 40% in H522 (<figref>FIGS. 2-5</figref>).</p>

      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0151">Initially, 100 cells growing in log phase were plated per 3 ml of media in each well of a six well plate. After 24 hrs of plating of the cells the test compound was added at varying concentrations. At 24 and 96 hours after addition of drug, the media was changed. Hence, the cells were only exposed to the drug for 24 hrs. When cell colonies appeared at Day 15 they were stained by Sure Stain Dye and counted. The hormone refractory prostate cancer cell line CWR22Rv1 was treated with increasing concentrations of parthenolide derivatives DMAPT, PIPT and 4MEPT for three hours. Cellular proliferation was reduced by up to 80% at 2 Î¼m in the clonogenic assay (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>). The breast cancer cell line clonogenic assay with hbl-100, mdl-231 and 436 cells showed almost complete inhibition of proliferation with DMAPT at 2 Î¼m concentration in the clonogenic assay (<figref>FIGS. 6-8</figref>). Parthenolide also reduced proliferation with similar dosage ranges.</p>

      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0155">3) At Time 0, 10 micromoles of DMAPT was added and then at Time+1 LPS (10 nM) was added.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0156">RNA was extracted using RNeasy Min Kit (Qiagen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Human Drug Targets for Inflammation and Immunomodulation Q series GE array kit (HS-048-12) was obtained from SuperArray Bioscience Corporation (Frederick, Md.). The kit determines expression of 96 genes that are associated with inflammation. RNA from respective samples was used as a template to generate biotin labeled cDNA probes using GEArray Ampolabelling RT kit (SuperArray, Bioscience Corp., USA). The cDNA probes corresponding to the mRNA population were then denatured and hybridization was carried out in GEHyb solution to nylon membranes spotted with gene specific fragments. Membranes were then washed in 2ÃSSC, 1% SDS twice for 15 minutes each, followed by 0.1 SSC, 0.5% SDS twice for 15 minutes each. Chemiluminescence was used to visualize the expression levels of each transcript and the results were quantified with the GEArray Analyzer. The change in a given gene transcript was estimated by normalizing the signal intensities with the signal derived from PPIA and with minimum background subtraction.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0157">As can be seen in Table 3, transcription of 25 genes was increased after pre-treatment with LPS. More importantly pretreatment with DMAPT prevented or blunted the increase in gene transcription induced by LPS. For example, the transcription of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), released in septic shock, is increased by 3 fold (298%) when treated with LPS. Pretreatment with DMAPT however prevents transcription of LPS and in fact decreases its production to 2% of control. Similarly, transcription of cyclo-oxygenase-2, the target of classical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, was increased 1.5 fold (150%). In the presence of DMAPT, the gene expression not only prevented the increase by LPS but decreased it to 30% (0.7) of solvent control. DMAPT therefore may act to decrease inflammation by decreasing cytokines as evidenced by decreased genes in human monocytes</p>

      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0158">Preliminary in vivo work was conducted to determine the bioavailability and toxicity of this agent in mice. As shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref> it was demonstrated that whereas 40 mg/kg of oral parthenolide provided a plasma level one hour after oral gavage of only Ë200 nM, the same dose of DMAPT provided a plasma level of Ë2500 ng/mL (ie 8 Î¼Mâaverage of 5 mice in each group; measured by LC-MS). Given the concern from providing such a high plasma concentration we completed a preliminary toxicity study that showed the mice gained weight and survived three weeks of daily treatment with oral DMAPT at 40 mg/kg with no overt toxicities.</p>

      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0159">Each cancer cell line in exponential growth phase was treated with solvent control or various concentrations of parthenolide derivatives dissolved in 100% ethanol for 3 hours prior to harvesting. Cells were harvested and whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (Nakshatri et al., <i>Mol Cell Biol, </i>17: 3629-3639, 1997; Sweeney et al., Clin Cancer Res, 10: 5501-5507, 2004). Extracts were incubated with a radiolabelled NFÎºB probe for 30 minutes at room temperature. The oligonucleotide probe binds to the NFÎºB DNA binding site in the promoter region of the immunoglobulin gene. Electrophoresis and autoradioragraphy were performed as described previously (Nakshatri et al., 1997) using NFÎºB and SP-1 probes (Promega, Madison, Wis.). The specificity of parthenolide and derivative inhibition of NFÎºB DNA binding was verified by the use of the SP-1 probe as a control. Identification of the NFÎºB subunits binding to DNA and inhibited by DMAPT were identified by gel supershift. Constitutive NF-ÎºB DNA binding activity was determined in the lung cancer cell lines A-549, H-23, H-522, and H-460. All four non-small lung cancer cells were treated with increasing concentrations of DMAPT for three hours, and NF-ÎºB DNA binding was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described. NF-ÎºB DNA binding activity was highest in A-549 cells, followed by H-23, H-522 and H-460 cells. DMAPT between 2 and 10 micromolar substantially decreased NF-ÎºB DNA binding activity in all lung cancer cell lines tested.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0160">Cancer cell lines HT-1376 and UMUC-3 were treated with increasing concentrations of DMAPT for three hours. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described and DNA binding by NF-ÎºB was analyzed by EMSA with NF-ÎºB and OCT-1 (internal control) probes. DMAPT decreased NF-ÎºB DNA binding in a dose-dependent manner with HT-1376 and UMUC-3 cell lines (<figref>FIG. 10</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0161">The hormone refractory prostate cancer cell line, CWR22Rv1 was treated with increasing concentrations of DMAPT for three hours. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described and DNA binding by NF-ÎºB was analyzed by EMSA with NF-ÎºB and SP-1 (internal control) probes. DMAPT decreased NF-ÎºB DNA binding in a dose dependent manner with substantial decreases of NF-ÎºB DNA binding at 10 Î¼M DMAPT.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0162">EMSA results thus showed DMAPT decreased the constitutive NF-ÎºB DNA binding in several cancer cell lines.</p>

      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0163">The radiation sensitive cell line A549 was pretreated with parthenolide concentrations ranging from 0 to 2.5 micromolar. The cells were then subjected to ionizing radiation doses ranging from 0-6Gy and survival fraction of the cells determined. Results demonstrated that parthenolide induced radiation sensitivity to the cells in a dose-dependent manner with survival fraction at 2.5 micromolar ranging from 10% at 2Gy to less than 1% at 6Gy. Cells not receiving pre-treatment with parthenolide had greater than 50% survival fraction at the highest radiation dose of 6Gy and over 90% survival at 2Gy.</p>

      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0164">MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (2Ã105 cells in 60 mm plates) were treated first with 2 or 5 Î¼M of DMAPT (LC-1). After two hours, TRAIL (TNF related-apoptosis-inducing-ligand, 5 ng/ml) or TRAIL-RII-activating antibodies (10 ng/ml) were added. After 48 hours of TRAIL or TRAIL-RII antibody treatment, cells were harvested and apoptosis was measured using carboxyfluorescein-FLICA assay. Briefly, both attached and floating cells were collected by trypsinization, incubated with carboxyfluorescein-labeled pan-caspase inhibitor FAM-VAD-FMK for 2 h at 37Â° C. Labeled cells were rinsed twice in PBS and resuspended in 300 Î¼l of PBS containing 0.3 Î¼g of propidium iodide. Apoptotic cells were identified by FACScan analysis. Live cells do not stain (<figref>FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>) Lower left quadrant). FAM-VAD-FMK stains apoptotic cells (upper left). Apoptotic cells that have lost plasma membrane integrity are stained by both FAM-VAD-FMK and propidium iodide (upper right). Necrotic cells are stained only by propidium iodide (lower right). MDA-MB-231 cells are relatively resistant to TRAIL. However, they became sensitive to TRAIL or TRAIL-RII activating antibody-induced apoptosis and atypical apoptosis upon pre-treatment with DMAPT.</p>
