      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Pyridyl amines have been used to prepare Group 4 complexes which are useful transition metal components in the polymerization of alkenes, see for example US 2002/0142912, U.S. Pat. No. 6,900,321, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,103,657, where the ligands have been used in complexes in which the ligands are coordinated in a bidentate fashion to the transition metal atom.</p>

      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">A key step in the activation of these complexes is the insertion of an alkene into the metal-aryl bond of the catalyst precursor (Froese, R. D. J. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 7831-7840) to form an active catalyst that has both a five-membered and a seven-membered chelate ring.</p>

      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">There still is need for adding synthetic routes to widen the range of catalysts complexes that may be prepared and broaden their performance in alkene polymerization. The performance may be varied with respect to the amount of polymer produced per amount of catalyst (generally referred to as the âactivityâ) under the prevailing polymerization conditions; the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution achieved at a given temperature; and the placement of higher alpha-olefins in terms of the degree of stereoregular placement.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Further, improved catalyst productivity is desired because it reduces in use catalyst cost. Additionally, single-site catalysts that produce high molecular weight, highly crystalline polypropylene are rare, yet desired for the production of polypropylene containing products of high stiffness.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0031">The specification describes transition metal complexes. The term complex is used to describe molecules in which an ancillary ligand is coordinated to a central transition metal atom. The ligand is bulky and stably bonded to the transition metal so as to maintain its influence during use of the catalyst, such as polymerization. The ligand may be coordinated to the transition metal by covalent bond and/or electron donation coordination or intermediate bonds. The transition metal complexes are generally subjected to activation to perform their polymerization or oligomerization function using an activator which is believed to create a cation as a result of the removal of an anionic group, often referred to as a leaving group, from the transition metal.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0032">Unless otherwise indicated, room temperature is 23Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0033">As used herein, the numbering scheme for the Periodic Table groups is the new notation as set out in Chemical and Engineering News, 63(5), 27 (1985).</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0034">As used herein, Me is methyl, Et is ethyl, Bu is butyl, t-Bu and <sup>t</sup>Bu are tertiary butyl, Pr is propyl, iPr and <sup>i</sup>Pr are isopropyl, Cy is cyclohexyl, THF (also referred to as thf) is tetrahydrofuran, Bn is benzyl, OAc is acetate and Ph is phenyl.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0035">The term âsubstitutedâ generally means that a hydrogen of the substituted species has been replaced with a different atom or group of atoms. For example, methyl-cyclopentadiene is cyclopentadiene that has been substituted with a methyl group. Likewise, picric acid can be described as phenol that has been substituted with three nitro groups, or, alternatively, as benzene that has been substituted with one hydroxy and three nitro groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0036">The terms âhydrocarbyl radical,â âhydrocarbyl,â and âhydrocarbyl groupâ are used interchangeably throughout this document. Likewise, the terms âgroup,â âradical,â and âsubstituentâ are also used interchangeably in this document. For purposes of this disclosure, âhydrocarbyl radicalâ is defined to be C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>100 </sub>radicals, that may be linear, branched, or cyclic, and when cyclic, aromatic or non-aromatic.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0037">A substituted hydrocarbyl radical is a hydrocarbyl radical in which at least one hydrogen atom of the hydrocarbyl radical has been substituted with at least one functional group such as NR*<sub>2</sub>, OR*, SeR*, TeR*, PR*<sub>2</sub>, AsR*<sub>2</sub>, SbR*<sub>2</sub>, SR*, BR*<sub>2</sub>, SiR*<sub>3</sub>, GeR*<sub>3</sub>, SnR*<sub>3</sub>, PbR*<sub>3</sub>, and the like, or where at least one heteroatom has been inserted within a hydrocarbyl ring.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0038">The term âcatalyst systemâ is defined to mean a complex/activator pair. When âcatalyst systemâ is used to describe such a pair before activation, it means the unactivated catalyst complex (precatalyst) together with an activator and, optionally, a co-activator. When it is used to describe such a pair after activation, it means the activated complex and the activator or other charge-balancing moiety. The transition metal compound may be neutral as in a precatalyst, or a charged species with a counter ion as in an activated catalyst system.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0039">Complex, as used herein, is also often referred to as catalyst precursor, precatalyst, catalyst, catalyst compound, transition metal compound, or transition metal complex. These words are used interchangeably. Activator and cocatalyst are also used interchangeably.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0040">A scavenger is a compound that is typically added to facilitate polymerization by scavenging impurities. Some scavengers may also act as activators and may be referred to as co-activators. A co-activator, that is not a scavenger, may also be used in conjunction with an activator in order to form an active catalyst. In some embodiments, a co-activator can be pre-mixed with the transition metal compound to form an alkylated transition metal compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0041">Noncoordinating anion (NCA) is defined to mean an anion either that does not coordinate to the catalyst metal cation or that does coordinate to the metal cation, but only weakly. The term NCA is also defined to include multicomponent NCA-containing activators, such as N,N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, that contain an acidic cationic group and the non-coordinating anion. The term NCA is also defined to include neutral Lewis acids, such as tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron, that can react with a catalyst to form an activated species by abstraction of an anionic group. An NCA coordinates weakly enough that a neutral Lewis base, such as an olefinically or acetylenically unsaturated monomer can displace it from the catalyst center. Any metal or metalloid that can form a compatible, weakly coordinating complex may be used or contained in the noncoordinating anion. Suitable metals include, but are not limited to, aluminum, gold, and platinum. Suitable metalloids include, but are not limited to, boron, aluminum, phosphorus, and silicon. A stoichiometric activator can be either neutral or ionic. The terms ionic activator, and stoichiometric ionic activator can be used interchangeably. Likewise, the terms neutral stoichiometric activator, and Lewis acid activator can be used interchangeably. The term non-coordinating anion includes neutral stoichiometric activators, ionic stoichiometric activators, ionic activators, and Lewis acid activators.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0042">An âolefin,â alternatively referred to as âalkene,â is a linear, branched, or cyclic compound of carbon and hydrogen having at least one double bond. For purposes of this specification and the claims appended thereto, when a polymer or copolymer is referred to as comprising an olefin, the olefin present in such polymer or copolymer is the polymerized form of the olefin. For example, when a copolymer is said to have an âethyleneâ content of 35 wt % to 55 wt %, it is understood that the mer unit in the copolymer is derived from ethylene in the polymerization reaction and said derived units are present at 35 wt % to 55 wt %, based upon the weight of the copolymer. A âpolymerâ has two or more of the same or different mer units. A âhomopolymerâ is a polymer having mer units that are the same. A âcopolymerâ is a polymer having two or more mer units that are different from each other. A âterpolymerâ is a polymer having three mer units that are different from each other. âDifferentâ as used to refer to mer units indicates that the mer units differ from each other by at least one atom or are different isomerically. Accordingly, the definition of copolymer, as used herein, includes terpolymers and the like. An oligomer is typically a polymer having a low molecular weight (such an Mn of less than 25,000 g/mol, preferably less than 2,500 g/mol) or a low number of mer units (such as 75 mer units or less). An âethylene polymerâ or âethylene copolymerâ is a polymer or copolymer comprising at least 50 mol % ethylene derived units, a âpropylene polymerâ or âpropylene copolymerâ is a polymer or copolymer comprising at least 50 mol % propylene derived units, and so on.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0043">For the purposes of this invention, ethylene shall be considered an Î±-olefin.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0044">A higher Î±-olefin or higher alkyl is defined to be an Î±-olefin having 4 or more carbon atoms.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0045">Unless otherwise noted, all molecular weights units (e.g., Mw, Mn, Mz) are g/mol.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0046">Unless otherwise noted all melting points (T<sub>m</sub>) are DSC second melt.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0047">A âring carbon atomâ is a carbon atom that is part of a cyclic ring structure. By this definition, a benzyl group has six ring carbon atoms and para-methylstyrene also has six ring carbon atoms.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0048">The term âarylâ or âaryl groupâ means a six carbon aromatic ring and the substituted variants thereof, including but not limited to, phenyl, 2-methyl-phenyl, xylyl, 4-bromo-xylyl. Likewise heteroaryl means an aryl group where a ring carbon atom (or two or thee ring carbon atoms) has been replaced with a heteroatom, preferably N, O, or S.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0049">The term âring atomâ means an atom that is part of a cyclic ring structure. By this definition, a benzyl group has six ring atoms and tetrahydrofuran has 5 ring atoms.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0050">A heterocyclic ring is a ring having a heteroatom in the ring structure as opposed to a heteroatom substituted ring where a hydrogen on a ring atom is replaced with a heteroatom. For example, tetrahydrofuran is a heterocyclic ring and 4-N,N-dimethylamino-phenyl is a heteroatom substituted ring.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0051">The term âaromaticâ refers to benzene and derivatives of benzene, which are cyclic hydrocarbyl groups having six carbons in a ring with three alternating double bonds. As used herein the term âaromaticâ also refers to cyclopentadienes and pseudoaromatic heterocycles which are heterocyclic substituents that have similar properties and structures (nearly planar) to aromatic heterocyclic ligands, but are not by definition aromatic; likewise, the term aromatic also refers to substituted aromatics.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0052">The term âcontinuousâ means a system that operates without interruption or cessation. For example, a continuous process to produce a polymer would be one where the reactants are continually introduced into one or more reactors and polymer product is continually withdrawn.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0053">A solution polymerization means a polymerization process in which the polymer is dissolved in a liquid polymerization medium, such as an inert solvent or monomer(s) or their blends. A solution polymerization is typically homogeneous. A homogeneous polymerization is one where the polymer product is dissolved in the polymerization medium. Such systems are preferably not turbid as described in J. Vladimir Oliveira, C. Dariva and J. C. Pinto, Ind. Eng, Chem. Res. 29, 2000, 4627.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0054">A bulk polymerization means a polymerization process in which the monomers and/or comonomers being polymerized are used as a solvent or diluent using little or no inert solvent as a solvent or diluent. A small faction of inert solvent might be used as a carrier for catalyst and scavenger. A bulk polymerization system contains less than 25 wt % of inert solvent or diluent, preferably less than 10 wt %, preferably less than 1 wt %, preferably 0 wt %.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0055">The term âmultimodal,â when used to describe a polymer or polymer composition, means âmultimodal molecular weight distribution,â which is understood to mean that the Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) trace, plotted as Absorbance versus Retention Time (seconds), has more than one peak or inflection points. An âinflection pointâ is that point where the second derivative of the curve changes in sign (e.g., from negative to positive or vice versa). For example, a polyolefin composition that includes a first lower molecular weight polymer component (such as a polymer having an Mw of 100,000 g/mol) and a second higher molecular weight polymer component (such as a polymer having an Mw of 300,000 g/mol) is considered to be a âbimodalâ polyolefin composition. Preferably the Mw's of the polymer or polymer composition differ by at least 10%, relative to each other, preferably by at least 20%, preferably at least 50%, preferably by at least 100%, preferably by a least 200%. Likewise, in a preferred embodiment, the Mw's of the polymer or polymer composition differ by 10% to 10,000%, relative to each other, preferably by 20% to 1000%, preferably 50% to 500%, preferably by at least 100% to 400%, preferably 200% to 300%.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0056">Unless otherwise indicated âcatalyst activityâ is a measure of how many kilograms of polymer (P) are produced using a polymerization catalyst comprising W mmol of transition metal (M), over a period of time of T hours; and may be expressed by the following formula: P/(TÃW).</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0057">In a first aspect of the invention there is provided a pyridyldiamido transition metal complex (optionally for use in alkene polymerization) represented by the formula (A) or (B):</p>

      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0112">The pyridyl diamine ligands described herein are generally prepared in multiple steps. One step involves the preparation of an amine-containing âlinkerâ group where the linker is typically a boronic acid ester of an aryl methyl amine or substituted amine This amine-containing linker may be prepared from an aryl-methyl boronic ester in two steps, the first of which involves the conversion of the methyl group to a halo-methyl group by free radical halogenation in unreactive solvents (e.g., CCl<sub>4</sub>, benzene). The second step then involves reaction of this halo-methyl group containing species with an amine or protected amine or deprotonated protected amine to yield an amine-containing linker. This amine-containing linker is then coupled with a suitable pyridine containing species, such as 6-bromo-2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde. This coupling step typically uses a metal catalyst (e.g., Pd(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>) in less than 5 mol % loading. Following this coupling step, the new derivative, which can be described as amine-linker-pyridine-aldehyde, is then reacted with a second amine to produce the imine derivative amine-linker-pyridine-imine in a condensation reaction. This can then be reduced to the pyridyl diamine ligand by reaction with a suitable aryl anion, alkyl anion, or hydride source. This reaction is generally performed in etherial solvents at temperatures between â100Â° C. and 50Â° C. when aryllithium or alkyllithium reagents are employed. This reaction is generally performed in methanol at reflux when sodium cyanoborohydride is employed. The pyridyldiamine product and intermediate amine-containing products can be purified either using column chromatography or by procedures involving the formation of acid salts, such as that described in example 2 in U.S. Pat. No. 8,212,047 B2.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0113">The preparation of pyridyl diamide metal complexes from pyridyl diamines may be accomplished using typical protonolysis and methylation reactions. In the protonolysis reaction the pyridyl diamine is reacted with a suitable metal reactant to produce a pyridyldiamide metal complex. A suitable metal reactant will feature a basic leaving group that will accept a proton from the pyridiyl diamine and then generally depart and be removed from the product. Suitable metal reactants include, but are not limited to, HfBn<sub>4 </sub>(Bn=CH<sub>2</sub>Ph), ZrBn<sub>4</sub>, TiBn<sub>4</sub>, ZrBn<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>(OEt<sub>2</sub>), HfBn<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>(OEt<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, Zr(NMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>(dimethoxyethane), Hf(NMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>(dimethoxyethane), Hf(NMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, and Hf(NEt<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>. Pyridyldiamide (PDA) metal complexes that contain metal-chloride groups, such as the PDA dichloride complex in Scheme 1 below, can be alkylated by reaction with an appropriate organometallic reagent. Suitable reagents include organolithium and organomagnesium, and Grignard reagents. The alkylations are generally performed in etherial or hydrocarbon solvents or solvent mixtures at temperatures typically ranging from â100Â° C. to 50Â° C.</p>

This lithium salt then may be reacted with a metal halide, such as HfCl<sub>4 </sub>or ZrCl<sub>4</sub>, to form a pyridyldiamide complex.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0115">The choice of the R<sup>17 </sup>group of the pyridyldiamide complexes can have a large effect on the polymerization activity of the activated complex and on the properties of the polymer produced. In particular, a cyclohexyl at the R<sup>17 </sup>position (as opposed to a phenyl group) has been found to increase catalyst activity dramatically for propylene polymerization. Additionally, the melting point of the polypropylene produced is much higher for the cyclohexyl substituted catalysts. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors suggest that the use of a non-aromatic hydrocarbon group in the R<sup>17 </sup>position is advantageous because these groups increase the donor ability of the amido nitrogen to which they are bound. Other groups that are more electron donating than a phenyl group may also be desirable, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, primary alkyls, branched primary alkyls, secondary alkyl, cycloalkyls, and tertiary alkyls.</p>

For propylene polymerizations performed at 85Â° C. the substitution at the R<sub>17 </sub>group with a cyclohexyl group has yielded catalysts capable of forming polypropylene with an activity of over 300 kg/mmol/hr, whereas the catalyst with R<sub>17 </sub>being phenyl demonstrated an activity of 100 kg/mmol/hr. For propylene polymerizations performed at 100Â° C. the substitution at the R<sub>17 </sub>group with a cyclohexyl group has yielded catalysts capable of forming polypropylene with an activity of over 110 kg/mmol/hr, whereas the catalysts with R<sub>17 </sub>being phenyl demonstrated an activity of less than 70 kg/mmol/hr.</p>

The catalyst systems may also be added to or generated in solution polymerization or bulk polymerization (in the monomer). The catalyst system typically comprise a complex as described above and an activator such as alumoxane or a non-coordinating anion. Activation may be performed using alumoxane solution including methyl alumoxane, referred to as MAO, as well as modified MAO, referred to herein as MMAO, containing some higher alkyl groups to improve the solubility. Particularly useful MAO can be purchased from Albemarle in a 10 wt % solution in toluene. The catalyst system employed in the present invention preferably uses an activator selected from alumoxanes, such as methyl alumoxane, modified methyl alumoxane, ethyl alumoxane, iso-butyl alumoxane, and the like.</p>

The cation in the precursor may, alternatively, be trityl. Alternatively, the transition metal complex may be reacted with a neutral NCA precursor, such as B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, which abstracts an anionic group from the complex to form an activated species. Useful activators include N,N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl)borate (i.e., [PhNMe<sub>2</sub>H]B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>) and N,N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis (heptafluoronaphthyl)borate, where Ph is phenyl, and Me is methyl.</p>

Typically, the complex and activator may be combined in solvent to form a solution. Then the support is added, and the mixture is stirred for 1 minute to 10 hours. The total solution volume may be greater than the pore volume of the support, but some embodiments limit the total solution volume below that needed to form a gel or slurry (about 90% to 400%, preferably about 100-200% of the pore volume). After stirring, the residual solvent is removed under vacuum, typically at ambient temperature and over 10-16 hours. But greater or lesser times and temperatures are possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0161">The complex may also be supported absent the activator; in that case, the activator (and co-activator if needed) is added to a polymerization process's liquid phase. Additionally, two or more different complexes may be placed on the same support. Likewise, two or more activators or an activator and co-activator may be placed on the same support.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0162">Suitable solid particle supports are typically comprised of polymeric or refractory oxide materials, each being preferably porous. Preferably any support material that has an average particle size greater than 10 Î¼m is suitable for use in this invention. Various embodiments select a porous support material, such as for example, talc, inorganic oxides, inorganic chlorides, for example magnesium chloride and resinous support materials such as polystyrene polyolefin or polymeric compounds or any other organic support material and the like. Some embodiments select inorganic oxide materials as the support material including Group-2, -3, -4, -5, -13, or -14 metal or metalloid oxides. Some embodiments select the catalyst support materials to include silica, alumina, silica-alumina, and their mixtures. Other inorganic oxides may serve either alone or in combination with the silica, alumina, or silica-alumina. These are magnesia, titania, zirconia, and the like. Lewis acidic materials such as montmorillonite and similar clays may also serve as a support. In this case, the support can optionally double as the activator component, however, an additional activator may also be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0163">The support material may be pretreated by any number of methods. For example, inorganic oxides may be calcined, chemically treated with dehydroxylating agents such as aluminum alkyls and the like, or both.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0164">As stated above, polymeric carriers will also be suitable in accordance with the invention, see for example the descriptions in WO 95/15815 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,991. The methods disclosed may be used with the catalyst complexes, activators or catalyst systems of this invention to adsorb or absorb them on the polymeric supports, particularly if made up of porous particles, or may be chemically bound through functional groups bound to or in the polymer chains.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0165">Useful supports typically have a surface area of from 10-700 m<sup>2</sup>/g, a pore volume of 0.1-4.0 cc/g and an average particle size of 10-500 Î¼m. Some embodiments select a surface area of 50-500 m<sup>2</sup>/g, a pore volume of 0.5-3.5 cc/g, or an average particle size of 20-200 Î¼m. Other embodiments select a surface area of 100-400 m<sup>2</sup>/g, a pore volume of 0.8-3.0 cc/g, and an average particle size of 30-100 Î¼m. Useful supports typically have a pore size of 10-1000 Angstroms, alternatively 50-500 Angstroms, or 75-350 Angstroms.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0166">The catalyst complexes described herein are generally deposited on the support at a loading level of 10-100 micromoles of complex per gram of solid support; alternately 20-80 micromoles of complex per gram of solid support; or 40-60 micromoles of complex per gram of support. But greater or lesser values may be used provided that the total amount of solid complex does not exceed the support's pore volume.</p>

      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0167">Inventive catalyst complexes are useful in polymerizing unsaturated monomers conventionally known to undergo metallocene-catalyzed polymerization such as solution, slurry, gas-phase, and high-pressure polymerization. Typically one or more of the complexes described herein, one or more activators, and one or more monomers are contacted to produce polymer. In certain embodiments, the complexes may be supported and as such will be particularly useful in the known, fixed-bed, moving-bed, fluid-bed, slurry, solution, or bulk operating modes conducted in single, series, or parallel reactors.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0168">One or more reactors in series or in parallel may be used in the present invention. The complexes, activator and when required, co-activator, may be delivered as a solution or slurry, either separately to the reactor, activated in-line just prior to the reactor, or preactivated and pumped as an activated solution or slurry to the reactor. Polymerizations are carried out in either single reactor operation, in which monomer, comonomers, catalyst/activator/co-activator, optional scavenger, and optional modifiers are added continuously to a single reactor or in series reactor operation, in which the above components are added to each of two or more reactors connected in series. The catalyst components can be added to the first reactor in the series. The catalyst component may also be added to both reactors, with one component being added to first reaction and another component to other reactors. In one preferred embodiment, the complex is activated in the reactor in the presence of olefin.</p>

Polymerization may be homogeneous (solution or bulk polymerization) or heterogeneous (slurryâin a liquid diluent, or gas phaseâin a gaseous diluent). In the case of heterogeneous slurry or gas phase polymerization, the complex and activator may be supported. Silica is useful as a support herein. Chain transfer agents (such as hydrogen, or diethyl zinc) may be used in the practice of this invention.</p>

      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0177">In some embodiments, when using the complexes described herein, particularly when they are immobilized on a support, the catalyst system will additionally comprise one or more scavenging compounds. Here, the term scavenging compound means a compound that removes polar impurities from the reaction environment. These impurities adversely affect catalyst activity and stability. Typically, the scavenging compound will be an organometallic compound such as the Group-13 organometallic compounds of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,153,157 and 5,241,025 and WO-A-91/09882, WO-A-94/03506, WO-A-93/14132, and that of WO 95/07941. Exemplary compounds include triethyl aluminum, triethyl borane, tri-iso-butyl aluminum, methyl alumoxane, iso-butyl alumoxane, and tri-n-octyl aluminum. Those scavenging compounds having bulky or C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>20 </sub>linear hydrocarbyl substituents connected to the metal or metalloid center usually minimize adverse interaction with the active catalyst. Examples include triethylaluminum, but more preferably, bulky compounds such as tri-iso-butyl aluminum, tri-iso-prenyl aluminum, and long-chain linear alkyl-substituted aluminum compounds, such as tri-n-hexyl aluminum, tri-n-octyl aluminum, or tri-n-dodecyl aluminum. When alumoxane is used as the activator, any excess over that needed for activation will scavenge impurities and additional scavenging compounds may be unnecessary. Alumoxanes also may be added in scavenging quantities with other activators, e.g., methylalumoxane, [Me<sub>2</sub>HNPh]<sup>+</sup>[B(pfp)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>â</sup> or B(pfp)<sub>3 </sub>(perfluorophenyl=pfp=C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>).</p>

      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0182">Tm, Melting temperature (also referred to as melting point), is measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) on a commercially available instrument (e.g., TA Instruments 2920 DSC). Typically, 6 to 10 mg of molded polymer are sealed in an aluminum pan and loaded into the instrument at room temperature. Melting data (first heat) is acquired by heating the sample to at least 30Â° C. above its melting temperature, typically 220Â° C. for polypropylene, at a heating rate of 10Â° C./min. The sample is held for at least 5 minutes at this temperature to destroy its thermal history. Crystallization data are acquired by cooling the sample from the melt to at least 50Â° C. below the crystallization temperature, typically â50Â° C. for polypropylene, at a cooling rate of 20Â° C./min. The sample is held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes, and finally heated at 10Â° C./min to acquire additional melting data (second heat). The endothermic melting transition (first and second heat) and exothermic crystallization transition are analyzed according to standard procedures. The melting temperatures reported are the peak melting temperatures from the second heat unless otherwise specified. For polymers displaying multiple peaks, the melting temperature is defined to be the peak melting temperature from the melting trace associated with the largest endothermic calorimetric response (as opposed to the peak occurring at the highest temperature).</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0183">Measurements of weight average molecular weight (Mw), number average molecular weight (Mn), and z average molecular weight (Mz) are determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) as described in Macromolecules, 2001, Vol. 34, No. 19, pg. 6812, which is fully incorporated herein by reference, including that, a High Temperature Size Exclusion Chromatograph (SEC, Waters Alliance 2000), equipped with a differential refractive index detector (DRI) equipped with three Polymer Laboratories PLgel 10 mm Mixed-B columns is used. The instrument is operated with a flow rate of 1.0 cm<sup>3</sup>/min, and an injection volume of 300 Î¼L. The various transfer lines, columns and differential refractometer (the DRI detector) are housed in an oven maintained at 145Â° C. Polymer solutions are prepared by heating 0.75 to 1.5 mg/mL of polymer in filtered 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene (TCB) containing Ë1000 ppm of butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) at 160Â° C. for 2 hours with continuous agitation. A sample of the polymer containing solution is injected into to the GPC and eluted using filtered 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) containing Ë1000 ppm of BHT. The separation efficiency of the column set is calibrated using a series of narrow MWD polystyrene standards reflecting the expected Mw range of the sample being analyzed and the exclusion limits of the column set. Seventeen individual polystyrene standards, obtained from Polymer Laboratories (Amherst, Mass.) and ranging from Peak Molecular Weight (Mp) Ë580 to 10,000,000, were used to generate the calibration curve. The flow rate is calibrated for each run to give a common peak position for a flow rate marker (taken to be the positive inject peak) before determining the retention volume for each polystyrene standard. The flow marker peak position is used to correct the flow rate when analyzing samples. A calibration curve (log (Mp) vs. retention volume) is generated by recording the retention volume at the peak in the DRI signal for each PS standard, and fitting this data set to a 2nd-order polynomial. The equivalent polyethylene molecular weights are determined by using the Mark-Houwink coefficients shown in Table B.</p>

      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0256">Shown in Table 1 are propylene polymerization data complexes A, B, and J and comparative complexes C, D, and K. From these data it is shown that the catalysts formed by the activation of complexes A, B, and J have unexpectedly significantly higher activity than the comparative examples. Additionally polypropylene formed by complexes A, B, and J have unexpectedly higher melting points than the polypropylene prepared by comparative complexes C, D, and K. For example, comparing run 1 with run 3 (Table 1), it is observed that the catalyst formed from complex A has over 4 times the activity of the catalyst formed by complex C (comparative). Thus, it can be concluded that the substitution of a phenyl group of complex C for a cyclohexyl group (to give complex A) is unexpectedly advantageous. Additionally the polypropylene produced in run 1 has a 15Â° C. higher melting point than that produced in run 3. Comparing run 5 to run 6 (Table 1) we see a similar trend. It is observed that the catalyst formed by complex B is nearly 3 times as active as the catalyst formed by complex D (comparative). Additionally, the melting point of the polypropylene formed in run 5 is over 7Â° C. higher than that formed in run 6 (comparative). Thus, it can be concluded that the substitution of a phenyl group of complex D for a cyclohexyl group (to give complex B) is unexpectedly advantageous. The same trends hold for polymerizations performed at 100Â° C. (Table 1). Comparing run 7 to run 9 it is observed that the catalyst formed from complex A is more active than the catalyst formed from complex C (comparative). The polypropylene formed in run 7 also has a higher melting point than the polypropylene formed in run 9 (comparative). Thus, it can be concluded that the substitution of a phenyl group of complex C for a cyclohexyl group (to give complex A) is unexpectedly advantageous. Comparing run 8 to run 10 it is observed that the catalyst formed from complex B is more active than the catalyst formed from complex D (comparative). The polypropylene formed in run 8 also has a higher melting point than the polypropylene formed in run 10 (comparative). Thus, it can be concluded that the substitution of a phenyl group of complex D for a cyclohexyl group (to give complex B) is unexpectedly advantageous.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0257">The catalyst formed by the activation of comparative complex K was found to have much lower activity for propylene polymerization than the other complexes. As shown in runs 14-16, the catalyst yielded only trace amounts of polypropylene. Thus, substitution at R<sup>17 </sup>with tertiary butyl was not advantageous.</p>
      <heading id="h-00018-en" level="2">General Polymerization Procedures</heading>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0258">Unless stated otherwise propylene polymerizations were carried out in a parallel, pressure reactor, as generally described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,306,658; U.S. Pat. No. 6,455,316; U.S. Pat. No. 6,489,168; WO 00/09255; and Murphy et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2003, 125, pages 4306-4317, each of which is fully incorporated herein by reference for US purposes. Although the specific quantities, temperatures, solvents, reactants, reactant ratios, pressures, and other variables are frequently changed from one polymerization run to the next, the following describes a typical polymerization performed in a parallel, pressure reactor. Table 1 below reports specific runs.</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0259">A pre-weighed glass vial insert and disposable stirring paddle were fitted to each reaction vessel of the reactor, which contains 48 individual reaction vessels. Then solvent (typically isohexane) was added to bring the total reaction volume, including the subsequent additions, to 4 mL. Propylene gas was introduced and the reactor vessels were heated to their set temperature. At this time scavenger and/or co-catalyst and/or a chain transfer agent, such as tri-n-octylaluminum in toluene (typically 100-1000 nmol) was added.</p>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0260">The contents of the vessel were stirred at 800 rpm. An activator solution (1.1 molar equivalents of N,N dimethyl anilinium tetrakis-pentafluorophenyl borate dissolved in toluene) was then injected into the reaction vessel along with 500 microliters of toluene, followed by a toluene solution of catalyst (typically 0.40 mM in toluene, usually 20-40 nanomols of catalyst) and another aliquot of toluene (500 microliters). Equivalence is determined based on the mol equivalents relative to the moles of the transition metal in the catalyst complex.</p>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0261">The reaction was then allowed to proceed until a pre-determined amount of pressure had been taken up by the reaction or a set amount of time had elapsed. At this point, the reaction was quenched by pressurizing the vessel with compressed air. After the polymerization reaction, the glass vial insert containing the polymer product and solvent was removed from the pressure cell and the inert atmosphere glove box, and the volatile components were removed using a Genevac HT-12 centrifuge and Genevac VC3000D vacuum evaporator operating at elevated temperature and reduced pressure. The vial was then weighed to determine the yield of the polymer product. The resultant polymer was analyzed by Rapid GPC (see below) to determine the molecular weight and by DSC (see below) to determine melting point.</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0262">To determine various molecular weight related values by GPC, high temperature size exclusion chromatography was performed using an automated âRapid GPCâ system as generally described in U.S. Pat.

No. 6,454,947; US 6,260,407; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,294,388; each of which is fully incorporated herein by reference for US purposes. This apparatus has a series of three 30 cmÃ7.5 mm linear columns, each containing PLgel 10 um, Mix B. The GPC system was calibrated using polystyrene standards ranging from 580-3,390,000 g/mol. The system was operated at an eluent flow rate of 2.0 mL/minutes and an oven temperature of 165Â° C. 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene was used as the eluent. The polymer samples were dissolved in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at a concentration of 0.1-0.9 mg/mL. 250 uL of a polymer solution was injected into the system. The concentration of the polymer in the eluent was monitored using an infrared absorption or evaporative light scattering (run 19 only) detector. The molecular weights presented are relative to linear polystyrene standards and are uncorrected.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0263">Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed on a TA-Q100 instrument to determine the melting point of the polymers. Samples were pre-annealed at 220Â° C. for 15 minutes and then allowed to cool to room temperature overnight. The samples were then heated to 220Â° C. at a rate of 100Â° C./minutes and then cooled at a rate of 50Â° C./min. Melting points were collected during the heating period.</p>
