      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">For example, using 1,4-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid (1,4-CHDA) as alicyclic dicarboxylic acid, and 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol (1,4-CHDM) as alicyclic diol, a polyester resin excellent in biodegradability (refer to, for example, Patent Document 1), a conductive polyester emitting a less amount of gas (refer to, for example, Patent Document 2), and a polyester having a short foam-disappearing time, suitable for use in medical application (refer to, for example, Patent Document 3) are synthesized. Furthermore, using tricyclo[3.3.1.1<sup>3,7</sup>]decane dicarboxylic acid as alicyclic dicarboxylic acid, and tricyclo[3.3.1.1<sup>3,7</sup>]decane diol as alicyclic diol, a polyester resin having small optical anisotropy, excellent in moldability, is synthesized (refer to, for example, Patent Document 4).</p>

Subsequently, the oil phase was washed twice with 100 ml of 2% caustic soda aqueous solution and twice with 100 ml of distilled water, and was dehydrated with 10 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate. After dehydration, the produced liquid was analyzed by gas chromatography. As a result, the yield of the dicarboxylic acid ester compound was 26.6 mol % (on 4-isopropenyl-1-methyl-1-cyclohexene basis), and the yield of methyl-4-(1-methoxy-2-methyl-1-oxopropan-2-yl)-1-methylcyclohexane carboxylate was 21.1 mol % (on 4-isopropenyl-1-methyl-1-cyclohexene basis, isomer ratio: 79.2%).</p>

      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0082">By reduced-pressure distillation of the liquid produced in the esterification step with an evaporator, low-boiling point substances were removed from the liquid. Subsequently, the low-boiling point substance-removed liquid was rectified using a rectification column with a theoretical plate number of 20 (distillation temperature: 177Â° C., degree of vacuum: 20 torr). Through the rectification, 42.0 g of a product as main fraction having an isomer ratio of 92.0% by gas chromatography analysis (distilled yield: 93.2 mol %, on methyl-4-(1-methoxy-2-methyl-1-oxopropan-2-yl)-1-methylcyclohexane carboxylate basis) was obtained.</p>
