      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to small peptide fragments having a NF-ÎºB inhibitory activity and a composition comprising the same.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">An inflammatory response is known as a protective response of living organism for rehabilitating the structures and functions of tissues damaged by infection, trauma, etc. Mobilization of leukocytes to a focus of inflammation is critical for the rapid resolution of infections and restoration of tissue damages resulting from a variety of injuries. However, a misdirected or prolonged inflammatory response causes damage to the body's tissues or diseases. For example, inflammatory diseases are caused by bacterial or viral infection, e.g., cerebrospinal meningitis, enteritis, dermatitis, uveitis, encephalitis, or adult respiratory distress syndrome, or non-infectious factors, e.g., trauma, autoimmune diseases, or organ transplantation rejection. Inflammatory diseases are classified into acute and chronic inflammatory diseases according to symptoms or pathological features. Acute inflammation such as allergy or bacterial/viral infection is manifested as local signs such as a change in bloodstream, blood vessel size, and vascular permeability, and the recruitment of leukocytes. In contrast, a main pathological feature of chronic inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis, artherosclerosis, chronic kidney infection, or hepatocirrhosis is a continuous emigration of macrophages, lymphocytes, or plasma cells into foci of inflammation due to recurrence of inflammatory factors, thereby causing a long-lasting inflammatory response.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Pro-inflammatory mediators expressed at the sites of inflammation, such as cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen intermediates, cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), play a critical role in generation and maintenance of inflammatory reaction. It is known that the expressions of such pro-inflammatory mediators are controlled by transcription factors, such as NF-ÎºB (nuclear factor ÎºB), STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), AP-1 (activator protein1), HIF-1a (hypoxia-inducible factor 1a).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Cancer cells induced by carcinogens proliferate rapidly relative to normal cells, thereby forming tumor masses, invading surrounding tissues, and interfering with normal body functions. Cancer cells bring nutrients and oxygen by inducing angiogenesis, and metastasis thereof is also caused by angiogenesis. Although cancer cells grow infinitely at specific sites, they can also leave the sites from which they originated, migrate to and grow in new sites, whose process is called âmetastasisâ. Metastasis involve several key steps: conversion of cancer cells to migratory mesenchymal cells, dissociation of the mesenchymal cells from the original tumor sites, invasion into and spread through surrounding connective tissues and capillary vessels, migration through blood vessels, escape from the blood vessels, migration through connective tissues, and proliferation in secondary sites.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Meanwhile, NF-ÎºB has a homodimer form or a heterodimer form, which is derived from the 5 subunits, i.e., RelA (p65), c-Rel, RelB, p50 (NF-ÎºB1), and p52 (NF-ÎºB2). All the subunits share the DNA binding sites, the dimerization sites, the IÎºB (inhibitory KB) binding sites. In an inactivated state, NF-ÎºB binds to IÎºB in the cytoplasm, which inhibits the translocation of NF-ÎºB into the nucleus and the binding to target gene promoters. When NF-ÎºB is activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFÎ±, IL-1, etc.); physical stimuli (e.g., UV, radiation, etc.); pathogenic organisms and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) derived therefrom; double-strand RNAs, etc., NF-ÎºB dissociates from IÎºB to enter the nucleus and then binds to KB elements, thereby inducing the transcriptions of about 400 genes responsible for inflammation, immune response, tumor cell division, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, tolerance to anticancer agents, tolerance to radioactivity, etc. (Sethi G, Shanmugam M K, Ramachandrasn L, Kumar A P, Vinay Tergaonkar V. 2012. Multifaceted link between cancer and inflammation. <i>Biosci. Rep. </i>32:1). Therefore, NF-ÎºB is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in not only the control of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression but also the growth and/or metastasis of cancer cells.</p>

      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0037">The peptides of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 4 were respectively dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a concentration of 1 M. The resultant protein solutions were also used in the following experimental examples.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="1">Experimental Example 1</heading>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="1">Tests for Inhibition of NF-ÎºB Activity in Macrophage</heading>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0038">A reporter gene assay system was used for evaluating the activity of NF-ÎºB. The reporter gene is a NF-ÎºB-Luc in which several K enhancer elements (GGGAATTTCCGGGAATTTCCGGGAATTTCCGGGAATTTCCGGGAATTTCCGGGAA TTTCC) are bound to the firefly luciferase (Luc) gene derived from <i>Photinus pynalis </i>that is capable of binding with the NF-ÎºB protein in cells. The NF-ÎºB-Luc was purchased from Promega Corporation, USA) for the evaluation.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0039">The macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (ATCC TIB-71, USA) was added to each well of a 12-well plate in the concentration of 2Ã10<sup>5 </sup>cells. After 24 hours therefrom, NF-ÎºB-Luc (0.25 mg/well) and the pCMV-LacZ plasmid (Clontech Co., USA) (0.1 mg/well) were co-transfected into the macrophage cell line RAW264.7, using the Fugene-6 transfection kit (Promega Co., USA), according to the vendor's instruction. After 12 hours therefrom, the cells were treated with the peptides of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 3 in the concentration of 100 Î¼M, respectively. After 30 minutes therefrom, the cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and then cultured for 24 hours. Each reporter activity, i.e., NF-ÎºB-Luc activity, was measured using the Dualâ¢ Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corporation), according to the vendor's manual. The transduction efficiencies of the cells in each well were adjusted to the same level through the correction based on the Î²-galactosidase activity. All test results were verified through independent two separate experiments. The results obtained by measuring the NF-ÎºB-Luc activities are shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0040">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the NF-ÎºB-Luc activities in the groups treated with the peptides of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 3 were significantly reduced (about 30Ë40% reduction). These results mean that the peptides of the present invention inhibit the synthesis of NF-ÎºB-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p>

      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0041">We evaluated the inhibitory activities of the peptides of the present invention on the trans-endothelial migration of leucocytes involving inflammatory reaction, using the mouse endothelial cell line bEnd.3 (ATCC CRL-2299, USA). The mouse endothelial cell line bEnd.3 (4Ã10<sup>4 </sup>cells) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% serum were added to the upper compartments of Boyden chamber, and then cultured in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator at 37Â° C. for 24 hours. After washing with serum-free DMEM, the serum-free DMEM containing TNF-Î± (25 ng/ml) was added to each cell line, which was then cultured in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator at 37Â° C. for 4 hours. At this time, the peptides of SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 4 (100 Î¼M) were also added to each test group. After the 4-hour culture, the mouse monocytes WEHI274.1 (ATCC CRL-1679, USA) (1Ã10<sup>5 </sup>cells) were added to each upper compartment of the chamber containing the bEND.3 cell line, and then the numbers of the monocytes migrated to each lower compartment were measured for 4 hours. At this time, an invasion-inducing medium (the supernatant isolated after culturing NIH 3T3 cells in serum-free DMEM containing 0.005% vitamin C and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 24 hours) was placed in each lower compartment. The results thereof are shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0042">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, trans-endothelial migrations of the monocytes in the groups treated with the peptides of SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 4 were significantly reduced (about 25Ë40% reduction) as compared with that in the control group. The peptides of SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 3 showed similar inhibitory effects (data not shown). Therefore, it is expected that the peptides according to the present invention inhibit the trans-endothelial migrations of leucocytes, thereby being able to inhibit inflammatory reaction.</p>

      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0043">Effects of the peptides of the present invention on angiogenesis were evaluated as follows.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0044">Generally, interactions of basement membrane components of blood vessels with vascular endothelial cells play an important role in formation and maintenance of new blood vessels. When matrigel, basement membrane components, is treated to 24-well culture plate, plugs are formed through polymerization reaction. HUVECs were seeded at a density of 8Ã10<sup>4 </sup>cells/well to each well of the 24-well culture plate coated with matrigel. The protein solutions including each peptide of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 4 (3 Î¼g/Ml) prepared as in Example 2 and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor, 150 ng/Ml) were added to the wells. After incubation for 24 hours, formation of new blood vessels was examined using an inverted microscope (at 50Ã magnification). The photographs obtained by observing tube formations are shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>. The values obtained by the quantitative analyses for comparing the tube lengths thereof are shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>. In <figref>FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, the control is a group treated with only PBS having no peptide.</p>

      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0046">It is known that MMP-1, the expression of which is induced by ultraviolet stimulation in human dermal fibroblasts, degrades collagen fibers to facilitate cutaneous photoaging as well as wrinkle formation. Since the expression of MMP-1 is induced by NF-ÎºB activation, we evaluate the inhibition thereof by the treatment of the peptides of the present invention, using human dermal fibroblasts (ATCC PCS-201-012, USA).</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0047">The human dermal fibroblasts was irradiated with UVB (312 nm, 12.5 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) and then treated with the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 in the concentrations of 0.1Ë2 Î¼M. After 48 hours, the cell extracts were subject to the Western blotting assay so as to measure the expressions of MMP-1 and procollagen type-1. The results thereof are shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. As shown in FIG. <b>4</b>., the expression of MMP-1 increased by ultraviolet stimulation was reduced according to the treatment of the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 in dose-dependent manner; and the expression of procollagen type-1 increased by ultraviolet stimulation was increased according to the treatment of the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 in dose-dependent manner. Therefore, it can be seen that the peptide of the present invention can inhibit ultraviolet radiation-induced cutaneous photoaging.</p>

      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0048">We evaluated the inhibitory activities of the peptide of the present invention on expressions of the representative pro-inflammatory factors, i.e., TNF-Î± and IL-1Î±, the expressions of which are induced by ultraviolet stimulation. Specifically, the HaCaT cells (Molecular Biology Engineering Lab, Chemical &amp; Biochemical Engineering, Dongguk University) were irradiated with UVB (312 nm, 12.5 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) and then treated with the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 in the concentrations of 0.1Ë2 Î¼M. At this time, the control group was treated with dexamethasone (Dex) having the immunosuppressive function, at the irradiation of UVB. After 48 hours, the cell extracts were subject to the Western blotting assay so as to measure the expressions of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î±. The results thereof are shown in <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the expressions of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î± were reduced in the control group treated with dexamethasone; and also in the test group treated with the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 in dose-dependent manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0049">And also, the cell extracts were subject to the enzyme immunoassay so as to evaluate the inhibitory effects on formation of PGE<sub>2 </sub>(one of pro-inflammatory factors). The results thereof are shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>. For this assay, we also used the group treated with dexamethasone at the irradiation of UVB as a control group. In addition, the expression of COX-2 (which is a PGE<sub>2 </sub>formation-mediating enzyme) was measured through the Western blotting assay; and the results thereof are shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the PGE<sub>2 </sub>formation increased by ultraviolet stimulation was reduced according to the treatment of the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 in dose-dependent manner; and the expression of COX-2 was also reduced according to the treatment of the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 in dose-dependent manner. Therefore, it can be seen that the peptide of the present invention can effectively inhibit ultraviolet radiation-induced inflammation.</p>

      <heading id="h-00024-en" level="1">Tests for Inhibitory Activity Against Invasion of Cancer Cells</heading>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0050">After matrigel, basement membrane components, is subject to polymerization reaction in a transwell, human breast cancer cells MCF-7 (2Ã10<sup>5 </sup>cells) were loaded to the upper compartment of the transwell and then treated with each peptide of SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 4 in the concentration of 100 Î¼M, along with 0.1% BSA. An invasion-inducing medium (the supernatant isolated after culturing NIH 3T3 cells in serum-free DMEM containing 0.005% vitamin C and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 24 hours) was placed in each lower compartment. The cells were cultured in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator at 37Â° C. for 12 hours. Cells migrated into the lower compartments of the transwell were counted three times at 24-hour intervals, and then the results were statistically analyzed. The control is a group treated with only PBS having no peptide. The results thereof are shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0051">As shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, in the groups treated with the peptides of SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 4 of the present invention, the base membrane invasion rates of the human breast cancer cells were reduced by about 60% to 80% relative to that of the control group with no peptide-treatment. Taking into consideration that cancer cells come out from blood vessels and invade basement membranes or surrounding connective tissues and then spread to secondary sites, it can be seen that peptides of the present invention can effectively inhibit the metastasis of cancer cells.</p>
