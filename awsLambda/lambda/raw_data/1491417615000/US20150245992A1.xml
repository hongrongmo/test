    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">Provided in the present invention is a pharmaceutic osmotic pump preparation comprising a tablet core, wherein the tablet core contains drugs (or pharmaceutically active ingredients) and materials forming a chamber structure; and a coating film coating the tablet core where a drug release hole is set; wherein when the pharmaceutic osmotic pump preparation releases drugs in water or an aqueous medium, the materials forming the chamber structure lead to the formation of a superfine chamber structure in the coating film, and the total volume of the superfine chamber structure Vb gradually increases over the releasing time, but the releasing rate R (or release amount A) of the pharmaceutically active ingredients is proportional to Vb. The osmotic pump preparation of the present invention is suitable for water-soluble drugs and water-insoluble drugs, and especially is suitable for the controlled release of low solubility drugs or pH dependent drugs.</p>

      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to the pharmaceutic preparation field, particularly to a novel pharmaceutic osmotic pump preparation with special internal micro chamber structures. Said osmotic pump preparation with novel type of structure is suitable for the controlled administration of water soluble drugs and water insoluble drugs, typically of drugs with low solubility.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Osmotic pump preparation is characterized with its constant speed of drug releasing, thus, it can avoid the blood concentration fluctuation phenomenon after the administration of conventional preparations and reduce the gastrointestinal and systemic side effects. The release characteristics are less affected by the variable factors of gastrointestinal tract. Different macrostructures of osmotic pump and applications thereof are getting rapid developed and valued. Hundreds of domestic and foreign patents emphasized on the macrostructure of osmotic pump and a variety of macroscopic structures were designed. However, neither internal micro structure of the osmotic pump or its dynamic change is used to control the drug release.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The literature about osmotic pump preparation was first reported in 1955. The earliest administration device by using osmotic pressure as releasing power is Rose-Nelson osmotic pump. Said device is composed of six parts: drug chamber, salt chamber, water chamber, rigid semi-permeable film between water chamber and salt chamber, elastic diaphragm between salt chamber and drug chamber, and rigid film for device covering. It does not have any practical value for human body due to its complicated process and huge volume up to 80 cm<sup>3</sup>. Higuchi and Leeper improved it and a Higuchi-Leeper osmotic pump was designed in 1971. Water chamber was removed and water in the body was used directly, thereby greatly simplifying the structure of osmotic pump device. In 1974, a elementary osmotic pump was developed by Theeuwes and Alza Corp. US together, which is composed of a tablet core covered with a semi-permeable film and a pore for drug releasing on its coating film (drug releasing pore), thereby simplifying the osmotic pump preparation into a form of common coating tablets and hence suitable for industrial production.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In the 1980's, a new type of osmotic pump was designed for osmotic pump system, i.e., micro-porous osmotic pump. High portion of water soluble component in the controlled releasing film enhanced the permeability of coating film and changed the semi-permeable film into micro-porous film which was permeable to drug molecules. Water soluble components were dissolved after contacting with water, thereby turning the controlled releasing film into micro-porous film. The punching process of osmotic pump preparation was removed for micro porous osmotic pump. However, the presence of enormous pores on the coating film enhanced the diffusion effect and thus resulting zero-order releasing curve turning to first-order. As to slightly soluble or easily soluble drugs, it is very hard to achieve the desired releasing rate only depending on the permeability of the drugs themselves. Therefore, a power layer is added supplementary to the single-layer osmotic pump and drug releasing rate is hence controlled by modulating the swelling rate of the power layer. A push-pull osmotic pump in 1982, a double-layer tablet coated with semi-permeable film, was suitable for easily soluble or slightly soluble drugs. The upper layer of the push-pull osmotic pump is a drug layer composing drugs and auxiliary materials and the lower layer is a power layer composing polymers and permeable materials. The drug layer connects the environment through the releasing pore. After the preparation has been taken, drugs in the drug chamber are powered by polymers in the power layer and then released through the releasing pore. The nifedipine controlled releasing tablet developed by Bayer DE belongs to this kind of double-layer osmotic pump tablet. Many improvements were made based on this osmotic pump and a variety of formulation characterized with different macrostructure were designed or developed, such as Delayed Release System (U.S. Pat. No. 5,221,278) (for pulsatile-released formulation of delayed-released formulation), Piston System (U.S. Pat. No. 6,132,420) (allows good delayed and pulsed effect) etc. However, the industrial application of push-pull osmotic pump is limited since the drug layer needs further recognition besides punching. In 1991, liquid oral osmotic pump system for oral administration was developed, and liquid drugs can be prepared into osmotic pump, including soft capsule liquid osmotic pump (U.S. Pat. No. 7,338,663), hard capsule liquid osmotic pump and time-delayed liquid osmotic pump (US20036596314). Drug liquid is wrapped in the soft capsule, coated with, in turn, isolated layer, permeation enhancing layer, and controlled releasing film layer with releasing pore through out those three layers. After the system is contacted with outside water environment, water permeates through controlled release film, permeation layer swells by water absorption and drug is released through small pores.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Recently, new designs continually appeared based on the known macrostructures of osmotic pumps. For example, the sandwich-type osmotic pump tablet system by using nifedipine as model drug was developed (L. Liu, et al. J Control. Release, 2000, 68: 145-156). The core consists of power layer in the middle and two adhering drug layers and is coated with a semi-permeable film. Advantage of this system is that drug can release through the pores on the opposite sides, thereby avoiding the drug-induced stimulation to the gastrointestinal mucosa. Sandwich osmotic pump tablet allows the omission of the reorganization process to the drug layer. Two-layered mixed pore osmotic pump preparation (D. Prabakaran, et al. Int. J. Pharm., 2004, 284: 95-108), in which single pore is used for upper layer drug releasing and controlled pore is used for lower layer drug releasing, thereby facilitating a simultaneous releasing of drugs with different solubility. The single-layer osmotic pump tablet is further developed into a system with extrudable core for delivering active ingredients of drugs with low solubility in high doses. An asymmetry film composing an extremely thin and rigid surface and thick spongy porous matrix layer is used in a controlled preparation of asymmetry film osmotic pump (U.S. Pat. No. 4,008,719, U.S. Pat. No. 6,899,887), which well solved the problem of incomplete releasing of insoluble drugs in osmotic pump controlled preparation by its high permeability to water and modulated the film permeability to water by controlling the structure and porosity of the film.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In pharmaceutics, pore-forming agent generally refers to the auxiliary material which is added into coating solution for improving the permeability of coating film, thereby improving the drug through-put rate through the film. It hasn't been reported that bubble-shaped structure can be formed when this kind of pore-forming agent is directly used in the core of the tablets. US patent (U.S. Pat. No. 4,203,439, U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,728) reported that materials capable of forming bubbles can be used as power chamber in the core to allow complete release of the drugs at a constant speed. However, the structure of this osmotic pump enables pressured power by bubble, while no vesicular micro structure formed by liquid vesicle is involved.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In conclusion, it is still unsatisfied despite of the osmotic pumps with different structures. Therefore, developing new osmotic pumps with simple structure and better controlled release effects is still in need in this filed.</p>

      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0155">Upon intensive and extensive studies, the inventors unexpectedly discovered that adding high portion of chamber structure forming material into the drug osmotic pump preparation allows huge amounts of micro chamber structures formed within the coating film with total volumes of micro chamber structures increasing over time, when drug osmotic pump preparation releases drugs in aqueous medium. Different modes of controlled release can be achieved effectively by the osmotic pump of the present invention through the evolution mechanism of the internal structures of the core. Upon modulating the ratio between chamber structures modulating agent and chamber structure forming material, a ratio matching the releasing characteristics of the desired drug can be designed and screened, thereby designing different modes of controlled drug releasing according to different drug characteristics. Based on the above works, the present invention is completed.</p>

      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0192">As used herein, term âmicro chamber structureâ or âchamber structureâ refers to the spherical, bubble-shaped, porous or vesicular micro structure inside the coating film formed after osmotic pump preparation according to the present invention contacts with water. Preferably, said micro chamber structure and chamber structure are liquid structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0193">Wherein, âmicro chamber structureâ can be determined by microimaging, preferably by synchrotron radiation light source microimaging, and chamber structure with a minimum diameter as low as about 5-10 Î¼m can be observed. Micro chamber structures will fuse and merge with the release of the drugs over time to form micro chamber structures or further chamber structures with lager volume. Generally, although a âmicro chamber structureâ can be used when the volume is over 10 mm<sup>3</sup>, the fused chamber structures with larger volume are named as chamber structures for convenience.</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0194">The micro chamber structures according to the present invention is characterized in the dynamic change of internal structures of micro chamber during the releasing process and the correlation between three-dimensional characteristic parameters such as total volume of vesicular structure involving structural changes and the releasing rate of drugs. Drug release is controlled by modulating the profile and three-dimensional characteristics of the micro chamber structures. The formed micro chamber structures include regular sphere, irregular sphere, the transition and mixture of regular and irregular shape, and the size evolution of the micro chambers.</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0195">Generally, the total volume of the micro chamber structures is represented by Vb, and typically, Vb refers to the volume of micro chamber structure and the volume of chamber structure formed by two or more micro chamber structures. Wherein, the ratio between the maximum value of Vb, Vbmax and the core volume Va is 90-100:100, preferably is 95-100:100. Furthermore, the internal volume of the coating film Vc can be generally deemed as identical with Va, which is identical with a profile volume of osmotic pump shaped with coating film, Vm. Therefore, Vb=Va=Vc=Vm, when Vb reaches to Vbmax. When the total amount of micro chamber structures keeps unchanged or declines, the average volume of said micro chamber structures gradually increases over time.</p>

The total volume of bubble-shaped, Vb gradually increases from 0; while the profile volume (Vm) of the osmotic pump formed by the outer film of the tablet may slightly increase when contacts with water, but essentially keeps unchanged during the releasing process.

The tablet core was coated by cellulose acetate-PEG 4000 (7:1) acetone solution until the weight increasing of the core reached 4%; a pore with a diameter of 0.8 mm on one side of the coating tablet was punched by laser. Oar method was used and 900 mL of degassing distilled water was used as releasing medium at a rotate speed of 75 RPM. Releasing rates at different times were determined. Tablets at different times were removed, sealed in a dryer filled with drying agent under ambient temperature and left for 48 hours. 2-D images from 180Â° view were collected for SR-Î¼CT 3-D scanning. The CT images were subjected to position correction and then 3-D reconstruction based on back projection algorithms. Upon reconstruction, the slicing parameters were set to section the reconstructed result for obtaining the slice tomography images of the sample in its horizontal direction, and the slice tomography images were exported and screened.</p>

      <p id="p-00233-en" num="0228">(3) Preparation process: Sodium phosphate and copovidone sifted through a 100-mesh sifter were weighed and then mixed to homogeneous. Then magnesium stearate was added, mixed to homogeneous, and tableted. The core was coated by cellulose acetate-PEG 4000 acetone solution until the weight increasing of the core reached 4%; a pore with a diameter of 0.8 mm on one side of the coating film was punched by laser.</p>
      <p id="p-00234-en" num="0229">(4) Determination method: Oar method was used and 900 mL of degassing distilled water was used as releasing medium at a rotate speed of 75 RPM. Releasing rates at different times were determined. Osmotic pump tablets at different times were removed, sealed in a dryer filled with drying agent under ambient temperature and left for 48 hours. 2-D images from 180Â° view were collected for SR-Î¼CT 3-D scanning. The CT images were subjected to position correction and then to 3-D reconstruction based on back projection algorithms. Upon reconstruction, the slicing parameters were set to section the reconstructed result for obtaining the slice tomography images of the sample in its horizontal direction, and the tomography images were exported and screened.</p>
      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0230">(5) Result: 3-D tomography scanning images show that the obtained osmotic pump possesses micro bubble-shaped structure, wherein, the micro chamber structures formed after placed in a releasing medium for 1.0 hr (<figref>FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>) show that the internal micro chamber structures distribute radially towards the core center, and the volume increases with the chambers closer to the core center.</p>
      <p id="p-00236-en" num="0231">(6) Conclusion: Sodium phosphate can be used as micro bubble-shaped structure modulating agent to modulate the profile and evolution mode and speed of the micro bubble-shaped, vesicular chamber structures.</p>

      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0233">(3) Preparation process: Ditto to Example 2 except that ketoprofen and copovidone were mixed to homogenous and then the amount as listed in the formulation of magnesium stearate was added.</p>
      <p id="p-00240-en" num="0234">(4) Determination method: Ditto to Example 2</p>
      <p id="p-00241-en" num="0235">(5) Result: The internal chamber structures of the osmotic pump tablet obtained according to this formulation are regularly spherical. The micro chamber structures formed in osmotic pump tablet after 1.0-hour dissolution (<figref>FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>) and the micro chamber structures formed in osmotic pump tablet after 2.0-hour dissolution (<figref>FIGS. 12</figref>, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>) show that the obtained micro spherical chamber structures are regular, uniformed and homogenously distributed. The amount of the chambers decreased and the diameter slightly increased due to the chamber fusion with the increasing time of hydration.</p>
      <p id="p-00242-en" num="0236">(6) Conclusion: As a insoluble drug with high doses, ketoprofen can remarkably promote the formation and stabilization of micro bubble-shaped structures with high sphericity and slow down the chamber evolution rate to some extent by increasing the system viscosity and decreasing hydration rate.</p>

      <p id="p-00247-en" num="0240">(5) Result: The structure formed according to this formulation is spherical with certain evolution rate. The chamber structures have lager volumes, evolve faster and are easily to fuse into lager chambers. <figref>FIG. 15</figref> and <figref>FIG. 20</figref> show the micro chamber structures formed in the osmotic pump tablet after 1.0 hour and 2.0 hours dissolution.</p>
      <p id="p-00248-en" num="0241">(6) Conclusion: At the earlier stage of drug releasing, micro bubble-shaped chamber structures were formed inside the osmotic pump from the film to the center, and some of micro bubble-shaped chamber structures with small size moved along the coating film towards the drug releasing pore (<figref>FIG. 21</figref>). Evolution rules during the releasing process of the chamber can be seen from time series tomography 2-D images (<figref>FIG. 22</figref>) and 3-D structure images (<figref>FIGS. 23</figref>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>): at 0.5 hr, the core was preliminarily hydrated, and the chamber has higher homogeneity and lower standard deviation of diameter. Most chambers distributed in the hydrated part firstly contacting with dissolution medium around the core. Upon water absorption, the system swelled, pressure was released through drug releasing micro pore, and the formed micro vesicles containing drugs were excreted for drug releasing. At 1.0 hr, the numbers of chambers changed little while the diameter and the homogeneity increased. Most chambers with larger diameter distributed in the highly hydrated part thoroughly contacting with the medium around the core, and a large number of chambers with lower diameters emerged in the core center. At 1.5 hr, the number of chambers started to decline. The existing chambers augmented continuously and then fused into larger chambers. The chamber diameters increased remarkably and the chamber homogeneity decreased significantly compared with that at the time of 1.0 hr. The chamber still had higher sphericity and the chambers with larger diameter still distributed in the highly hydrated part thoroughly contacting with medium around the core. At 2.0 hr, the number of chamber continuously declined, and the existing big chambers continuously swelled and merged the surrounded small chambers and expanded to the core center. The chambers moved towards to the core center gradually with its homogeneity decreased. At 3.0 hr, the core was essentially hydrated, small chambers in edge region drastically reduced, and the chambers essentially expanded to the core center and connecting with releasing medium through drug releasing micro pore, when the releasing entered a dominant stage of corrosion and diffusion. At 4.0 hr, the number of chamber remarkably reduced, and most parts of the core region were occupied. At 6.0 hr, only one chamber was remained occupying most parts of the core region, which had higher sphericity. At 8.0 hr, the remaining chamber further expanded to be more spherical.</p>
      <p id="p-00249-en" num="0242">For insoluble drug ketoprofen, copovidone as micro bubble-shaped structure forming material in combination with sodium phosphate as bubble-shaped structure modulating agent were used to modulate the micro structures and the evolution rate thereof for achieving the controlled release of ketoprofen. <figref>FIG. 27</figref> shows the accumulated releasing rate profile in vitro within 0-12 hours for ketoprofen. It can be seen that drug releases at a steady rate, and the average accumulated releasing rate at 12<sup>th </sup>hour is over 95%. Furthermore, changes of internal structures of micro chamber over time (<figref>FIGS. 28</figref>, <b>29</b> and <b>30</b>) and the total volume of vesicular structures are highly proportional to the drug releasing rate.</p>

      <p id="p-00254-en" num="0246">(5) Result: Irregular micro chamber structures were formed inside the osmotic pump preparation according to this formulation, which allowed the internal chamber space to connect with the releasing medium outside rapidly, thereby achieving the fast release of the drug in the core. Internal chamber structures of osmotic pump tablet after 1.0-hour dissolution (<figref>FIGS. 31</figref>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>35</b>) show that the chambers were formed very fast while merging, and the surface area of which is large.

Then, citric acid as listed in the formulation was added and mixed to homogeneous, and finally, a suitable amount of talcum power and magnesium stearate were added. The product was mixed to homogeneous and tableted. The core was coated by cellulose acetate-PEG4000 solution in acetone till the weigh increasing of the core reached 8%. A pore with a diameter of 0.8 mm on one side of the coating film was punched by laser or mechanic means.</p>
