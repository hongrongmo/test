    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention is related to a water-based printing ink composition which is suitable for film lamination applications.</p>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Laminates are multilayered shaped articles in which - according to the needs of the final article - each of the layers consists either of the same or of different materials. The preferred materials are paper, wood, textiles, metal and plastic films. In the field of food packaging, the laminates are mostly made from plastic or metal films, in particular metallized films, or a combination of both. Film materials are preferably chosen such that the laminates can be subjected to sterilization processes without deterioration of the film and/or the laminate. Printed pieces are laminated to protect them from stains, smudges, moisture, grease, tears and anything else that might shorten their service life. In addition to protection, print lamination adds strength and rigidity. As a further advantage, laminates impart to prints or generally images a satisfying appearance with respect to gloss and color fastness.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Generally laminates are produced by either joining two or more layers by means of adhesives or by adhesive-free extrusion coating. Irrespective of the production process a print or generally any kind of image which does not necessarily have to be printed can be applied to one or both of the layers prior to applying the next layer (<nplcit id="ncit-00001" npl-type="b"><text>Römpp Lexikon, Lacke und Druckfarben, ed. U.Zorll, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, New York 1998, p.214 and 318</text></nplcit>).</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Coating compositions for laminates, which are mainly in the form of printing inks, have to satisfy high standards. The resin as the film forming part (binder) of the composition must provide the dried layer with the required adhesive strength both to the underlying substrate and to the adhesive or to the extruded layer. As a further requirement, for some applications, the resin must impart to the dried layer stability during and after sterilization processes and/or treatment in boiling water even over a prolonged period of time (e.g. during food preparation). Further the dried layer must show blocking resistance and stability during sealing of the laminate (e.g. in the production of bags). The composition - as a printing ink - must be printable in flexographic and gravure printing processes which are the techniques commonly used for printing plastic films.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Polyurethane resins are one of the binders of choice in solvent-borne coating compositions (i.e. compositions comprising an organic solvent) for plastic films and in the production of image carrying laminates. However, for environmental reasons solvent-borne compositions are not preferred and are to be replaced by water-based compositions, in order to remove the content of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the composition.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Water-based compositions on the basis of polyurethanes as binder, however, do not show satisfactory properties in the field of lamination printing. While an acceptable adhesive strength (expressed as bond strength value) can be obtained, the printability of such formulations needs improvement. Also, such compositions have been found to be unstable in viscosity, i.e. to have a too low viscosity, which makes them difficult to handle, in particular in flexographic printing, or to have increasing viscosity during printing, which is difficult to handle.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">It was the problem of the present invention to provide an improved water-based printing ink composition, or an overprint varnish, which overcomes the above drawbacks and is suitable for film lamination applications.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">According to the present invention, the above problem has been surprisingly solved by a water-based printing ink composition, or an overprint varnish, comprising at least one polyvinylacetate polymer component as binder component and not more than 5-wt.%, preferably 0.1 -3 wt.-% and most preferably no polyurethane component, based on the total amount of the composition. So far, it has been assumed that at least some substantial portion of the binder component of a water-based printing ink composition, or an overprint varnish, suitable for film lamination applications has to consist of polyurethane. With the present invention, it has been shown that this is not correct.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The composition of the present invention is a water-based composition. According to the present invention, <i>"water-based"</i> designates a composition which comprises water as the major solvent component. Organic solvents, e.g. alcohols, are only present in an amount of at most 49 wt.-%, preferably at most 10 wt.-%, and most preferably at most 5 wt.-% of the total solvent content of the entire composition.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">According to the present invention, it has been found that a composition comprising at least one polyvinylacetate polymer component as a binder, but not containing any substantial amount of a polyurethane component, i.e. not more than 5-wt.% polyurethane, based on the total amount of the composition, is a suitable water-based printing ink composition, or an overprint varnish, for film lamination applications.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">According to the present invention, the term "<i>polymer"</i> refers to a macromolecule composed of more than 20 repeating units, the so-called monomers. A polymer comprising one sort of monomer is called a homopolymer, whereas a polymer comprising at least two different sorts of monomers is called a copolymer.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">According to the present invention, the term "acrylic polymer" refers to a polymer which is composed of at least one monomer comprising an acrylate moiety. Other monomers not comprising an acrylate moiety may additionally be present.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">According to the present invention, the term "polyvinylacetate polymer" refers to a polymer which is composed of at least one monomer comprising a vinylacetate moiety. Other monomers not comprising a vinylacetate moiety may additionally be present.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">According to the present invention, the term <i>"self-crosslinking polymer"</i> refers to a polymer which is capable of reacting with itself, under suitable conditions, resulting in a larger polymer. In order to be self-crosslinking, a polymer generally has to comprise two different reactive groups, or precursors of reactive groups, which under suitable conditions can react with each other.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">According to the present invention, all percentages of a composition are understood as to sum up to 100%.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Polyvinyl acetates are known in the art. According to the present invention, it is preferred to use polyvinylacetate copolymers, wherein the copolymer is composed of vinylacetate and an alkylene as monomers. As alkylene, preferably a C<sub>2-8</sub> alkylene, for example ethylene, propylene, 1-butylene, 2-butylene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, 1-heptene, 2-heptene, 3-heptene, or 1-octene, or mixtures thereof may be used. Especially preferred is ethylene. Vinylacetate and the alkylene monomer are polymerized by a radical polymerisation mechanism under conditions known to the skilled man.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Instead of or in addition to an alkylene, also other monomers such as acrylates, unsaturated fatty acids or other vinylic monomers such as vinyl chloride or vinyl esters may be used.</p>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, said at least one polyvinylacetate is used in the form of an emulsion having a viscosity (Brookfield viscosity at 25°C, 4/20, ISO 2555) in the range of 2000 - 10.000 mPas, preferably 4000 - 7000 mPas. Preferably, said emulsion has a solids content (ISO 3251, 130°, 30 min) in the range of 50 -70 %, preferably 55 to 65%.</p>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">According to the present invention, a preferred polyvinylacetate is a copolymer of vinylacetate, ethylene and acrylic acid esters, preferably made from a monomer blend comprising a vinyl acetate content in the range between 60 and 95 wt.-%, and an ethylene content in the range between 5 and 40 wt.-%, of the total blend. Such a copolymer is commercially available from Celanese as an emulsion copolymer under the trade names Mowilith® or Vinamul®, or from Scott Bader under the trade name Texicote®.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In the composition of the present invention, one or more polyvinylacetate polymers may be present. Preferably, only one polyvinylacetate polymer is present. Preferably, the at least one polyvinylacetate polymer is provided in the extender part of the ink composition of the present invention.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">According to the present invention, said polyvinylacetate polymer component is preferably present in an amount in the range from 10-50 wt.-%, preferably 20-40 wt.-%, based on the total composition. If more than one polyvinylacetate polymer component is used, the entire amount of polyvinylacetate polymer components in the composition of the present invention preferably lies in the range from 10-50 wt.-%, preferably 20-40 wt.-%, based on the total composition.</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Acrylic polymers are known in the art and commercially available. According to the present invention, if at least one acrylic polymer is comprised in the composition, it is preferred to use a mixture of different acrylic polymers, in order to optimize the properties of the composition.</p>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">According to the present invention, it is preferred that, if present, the at least one acrylic polymer component in the composition is a self-crosslinking acrylic polymer. It has been found that the presence of a self-crosslinking acrylic polymer improves the printability of the composition.</p>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Self-crosslinking acrylic polymers are known in the art. According to the present invention, water-based film-forming acrylic polymers are preferred. Particularly preferred are self-crosslinking acrylic emulsions having a viscosity (Brookfield viscosity at 25°C, 4/20, ISO 2555) in the range of 10 - 1000 mPas, preferably 100 - 500 mPas. Suitable self-crosslinking acrylic emulsions are commercially available from BASF under the trade name Joncryl® FLX, or from DSM under the trade name Neocryl® XK.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The term "<i>film forming"</i> is defined according to DIN 55945: 1996-09. Film forming is the generic term for the transition of a coating layer from the liquid to the solid state. Film forming occurs by means of physical drying and/or curing. Both processes may proceed simultaneously or one after the other. Whereas the term "drying" is more related to the process engineering used for drying a liquid layer, such as in ovens at elevated temperatures, the term "curing" is related to the chemical processes within the resin during the drying process.</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">If present, said self-crosslinking acrylic polymer is used in the ink composition, or an overprint varnish, of the present invention in an amount in the range from 5-30 wt.-%, preferably 10-20 wt.-%, based on the total composition. Preferably, the self-crosslinking acrylic polymer is provided in the extender part of the ink composition of the present invention.</p>

The first and the second substrate can also be of different chemical nature like polyester or polyamide such as Nylon.</p>
    <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">According to the present invention, as an adhesive in this process can be used any conventional solvent-free adhesive or solvent-based adhesive.</p>
    <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The adhesives are applied to the layer according to conventional methods, for example by using a hand coater, a roller of knife-coating. Alcohol-based adhesives are preferably diluted with a conventional diluent before application.

    <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Further part of the present invention is therefore a laminate produced by the method mentioned hereinbefore. Of course, the laminate can also be produced by extruding the second substrate on the first substrate carrying the dried layer. This method does not call for an adhesive.</p>

A counter-substrate (Polyethylene) was provided with a layer of an adhesive (Coim SF723/CA326) using a hand coater (simulation of flexo printing, HC1 (yellow), wet deposit thickness = 6µm) and subsequently dried. The printed substrate was applied onto the adhesive layer, and the substrate were pressed against each other using rollers, thus forming a laminate.</p>

The compositions according to example 1 and comparative example 2 were diluted until reaching a viscosity of 25 seconds (Cup AFNOR 4, 23°C). A drop of each composition was placed on the cylinder.. The compositions were spread with a piece of cardboard or plastic as a blade. The compositions were allowed to dry for about 2 minutes. Then, a fresh drop of each composition was placed onto the respective dried layer, corresponding to an anilox roller, and rubbed with a gloved finger, describing small circles on the spot. Using a spray bottle, a jet of water was put on the drop rubbed on the anilox roller to rinse the excess product. The facility of the water to remove the composition from the treated position was assessed as re-dissolution capability of the respective composition. The test was optionally repeated after a respective drying period, e.g. after 5 minutes or more (time can be more than one hour), until a difference between the compositions according to examples 1 and 2 could be observed.</p>
    <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">Subsequently, a cloth dampened with water was taken for rubbing on the anilox roller at a location other than where the ink drop was rubbed, to evaluate the ability of cleaning water.</p>
