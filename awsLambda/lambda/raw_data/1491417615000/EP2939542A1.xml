    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to baked confectionery.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">Background of the Invention</heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Wheat hull, also called wheat bran, is attracting attention as a material of health food, since it is rich in insoluble dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals and the like. Whole wheat flour obtained by milling whole wheat grains including their hulls is reported to have a hypotensive effect and an abdominal fat reducing effect, and also reported to reduce risk of mortality of diabetic patients.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In addition, protein is a nutrient required for producing blood, muscle, various enzymes and so forth, and is classified as one of the three major nutrients together with carbohydrate and fat.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Thus, the physiological function and nutritional balance of food can be improved by increasing the content of the insoluble dietary fiber and/or increasing the protein content of the food.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Patent Literature 1 describes an invention of producing a protein-rich and fiber-rich baked food which contains at least about 4 g of protein and 4 g of fiber per 30 g unit. Patent Literature 1 teaches a technique for producing a cracker rich in soybean protein, pea protein, wheat protein or milk protein, and digestion-resistant starch or oat fiber, through a specific production process, to thereby obtain a crispy cracker having texture that is not hard.</p>

    <heading id="h-00003-en">Summary of the Invention</heading>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present invention provides baked confectionery, containing: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>insoluble dietary fiber in an amount of from 4.0 to 12.0 mass%;</li><li>protein in an amount of from 10.0 to 30.0 mass%; and</li><li>lipid in an amount of from 8.0 to 15.0 mass%;</li></ul> wherein the insoluble dietary fiber includes wheat-bran-derived insoluble dietary fiber.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Further, the present invention provides a method of producing the baked confectionery described above, including preparing dough by blending therein at least wheat flour, wheat bran, protein-containing powder, and fat and oil, and then baking the dough.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In this specification, when the term "insoluble dietary fiber" is simply used to indicate an ingredient in the baked confectionery, the term means all of the insoluble dietary fiber contained in the baked confectionery.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Other and further objects, features and advantages of the invention will appear more fully from the following description.</p>
    <heading id="h-00004-en">Detailed Description of the Invention</heading>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The present invention is contemplated for providing baked confectionery increased in the blended amounts of both insoluble dietary fiber and protein, in which the baked confectionery causes little dry feeling in the mouth and has a moist food texture even though it is rich in insoluble dietary fiber, and the baked confectionery has a softer food texture due to having the dough being loosely packed and can be easily bitten off even though it is rich in protein.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In baked confectionery made using farina as a main ingredient, such as cookies, biscuits and low-calorie snack bars, moist and easy-to-eat ones, namely, ones that are easily bitten off and do not cause a dry feeling in the mouth during chewing, are generally favored.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The present inventors pursued a study on baked confectionery in which wheat bran is blended in order to improve a physiological function of the baked confectionery, and the protein content is increased in order to improve a nutritional balance. As a result, the present inventors found that baked confectionery reduced in dry feeling caused by saliva absorption, and thus being moist and easy-to-eat, and also having low dough agglomeration, and thus offering a softer food texture easily bite off, can be obtained by adjusting the content of the insoluble dietary fiber including the wheat bran and the protein content to specific ranges, in the baked confectionery containing a specific amount of lipid. Furthermore, the present inventors found that the so-obtained baked confectionery resists crumbling and is excellent in dough shape stability (quality stability).</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The present invention has been completed based on these findings.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In the present invention, "baked confectionery" means a biscuit, a cookie, a cracker, a hardtack, a pretzel, a pie, cut bread, shortbread, or the like as described in "<nplcit id="ncit-00001" npl-type="b"><text>Seikajiten (Confectionery Dictionary)," the first edition, October 30, 1981, p.204</text></nplcit>. The baked confectionery preferably includes a biscuit, a cookie, a hardtack, a pretzel, a pie, cut bread, and the like specified in the<nplcit id="ncit-00002" npl-type="s"><text> Fair Competition Code in 1971</text></nplcit>.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">More specifically, "baked confectionery" in the present invention means a product that is different from bread prepared by baking dough after many gas bubbles are incorporated therein by fermenting the dough with yeast, and also different from cake prepared by baking dough after many gas bubbles are incorporated therein by adding baking powder, meringue or the like to the dough.

The resultant mixture was allowed to stand in a water bath at 95Â°C for 30 minutes while the mixture was shaken at an interval of 5 minutes, and allowed to cool for 10 minutes at room temperature, and then 0.275 M sodium hydroxide solution was added thereto and adjusted to pH 7.5. Then, 0.1 mL of protease (manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich Corporation) solution adjusted to be a concentration of 50 mg/mL by dissolving the protease into 0.08 M phosphate buffer solution adjusted to pH 6.0 was added thereto. Activity of the added protease was 500 U/mL. Then, the resultant mixture was shaken at 60Â°C for 30 minutes, allowed to cool at room temperature for 10 minutes, and then adjusted to pH 4.3 using 0.325 M hydrochloric acid. Then, 0.1 mL of amyloglucosidase (trade name: Amyloglucosidase solution from Aspergillus niger, manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich Corporation) was added thereto, and the resultant mixture was shaken at 60Â°C for 30 minutes. Filtration was made using a crucible type glass 2G2, a product obtained by drying a residue at 105Â°C overnight was weighed, and taken as an amount of insoluble dietary fiber. A content of the insoluble dietary fiber in a baked confectionery was calculated based on thus obtained amount of insoluble dietary fiber.</p>

    <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">Measurement of protein was carried out according to a Kjeldahl method. Specifically, the measurement was carried out by the following method.</p>
    <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">A sample in an amount of 0.5 to 1 g was accurately weighed, and put into a decomposition flask. Then, 3 g of contact agent and 20 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid were gradually added thereto and the sample was thermally decomposed. A liquid in the decomposition flask became transparent and blue by copper sulfate was developed, and then heating was further continued for about 1 hour. After the liquid was cooled, water in an amount of 2 to 3 times the liquid was gradually added thereto and diluted. After the diluted decomposition liquid was sufficiently cooled, the liquid was put into 100 mL-volume measuring flask, and distilled by a Kjeldahl distillation apparatus. After distillation, the Erlenmeyer flask was removed, and titration was conducted using a 0.1 N NaOH standard solution. A value obtained by multiplying 6.25 times a nitrogen amount determined from a value obtained by titration was taken as a protein content.</p>
