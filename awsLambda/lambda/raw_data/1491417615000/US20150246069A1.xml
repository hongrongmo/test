      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The invention relates to oral cancer treatments and more particularly to a method of using sequence of antagomiR for developing medicine for inhibiting oral cancer cells from spreading.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">A biomarker is in general a substance used as an indicator of a biological state. It is a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. Currently, CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) is used for colorectal cancer indication and PSA (prostate-particular antigen) is used for prostate cancer indication. However, biomarkers for indicating oral cancer are not available as far as the present inventor is aware.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">MicroRNA (abbreviated miRNA) is a short ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule found in eukaryotic cells. A microRNA molecule has very few nucleotides (average of 22) compared with other RNAs.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">It is found that miRNA is capable of control target genes based on recent research. Further, different types of cancer have different miRNA molecules based on other recent researches. However, their applications to oral cancer treatment are unknown.

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 1 to 9</figref>, a method of using sequence of antagomiR for developing medicine for inhibiting oral cancer cells from spreading in accordance with the invention is illustrated below.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">It is envisaged by the invention that sequence of antagomiR can be combined with active ingredient to prepare a medicine which can be administered to the oral cavity cancer cell metastasis. Further, both miR-196a and miR-196b of sequence of antagomiR can effectively inhibit oral cancer cells from spreading. Both miR-196a and miR-196b present in the blood plasma, serum, saliva, or tumor of a patient are analyzed. miR-196a has the sequence of 5â²-UAGGUAGUUUCAUGUUGUUGGG-3â²(SEQ.ID.NO.1), miR-196b has the sequence of 5â²-UAGGUAGUUUCCUGUUGUUGGG-3â²(SEQ.ID.NO.2), anti-miR-196a has the sequence of 5â²-CCCAACAACAUGAAACUACCUA-3â²(SEQ.ID.NO.3), anti-miR-196b has the sequence of 5â²-CCCAACAACAGGAAACUACCUA-3â²(SEQ.ID.NO.4), scramble anti-miR-196a has the sequence of 5â²-AACAAAUUCAACCCGUCCCAAA-3â²(SEQ.ID.NO.5), and scramble anti-miR-196b has the sequence of 5â²-AUACAAAUCGCACGAACCAACC-3â²(SEQ.ID.NO.6). Intensity of miR-196a or miR-196b higher than normal value means the patient may have oral cancer. Oral cancer cells spread includes oral cancer cells migration and invasion.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The oral cancer cells spread includes oral cancer cells migration and invasion.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">First, nucleic acids of oral cancer cells are analyzed by using miR-196a and miR-196b according to the invention. Intensity of miR-196a and miR-196b in blood plasma of an oral cancer patient is next compared with that of a normal person. It is found that the intensity of miR-196a and miR-196b in blood plasma of the oral cancer patient is much higher than that of the normal person. Thus, it is possible of determining whether a patient has oral cancer in an early stage or not by calculating the intensity of miR-196a and miR-196b of blood plasma of the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">An analysis method developed by Agilent Technology (USA) is employed by the invention to compare nucleic acids in oral cancer cell lines of a patient with that in oral keratinocytes of a normal person. 470 nucleic acids in both 6 oral cancer cell lines of a patient and 5 normal oral keratinocyte are compared with each other and its results are shown in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>. In Y-axis, mean intensity of 6 oral cancer cell lines is shown and in X-axis, mean intensity of 5 normal oral keratinocytes is shown.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2B</figref>, 23 miRNAs are significantly different from each other in terms of 6 oral cancer cell lines (C) (mean value), 5 normal oral keratinocytes (mean value), fold (C/N), and P-value in columns. Low P-values means substantially the same characteristics of nucleic acids in the same group. Fold (C/N) for miR-196a is 17.20 and that for miR-196b is 10.96. This means that both miR-196a and miR-196b play a great role in oral cancer detection. 470 nucleic acids are detected. Next, clustering analysis of 190 nucleic acids out of the 470 nucleic acids is done after normalization and weak signals removal. This unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis is shown to divide samples into oral cancer cell lines and normal oral keratinocytes. These two groups are subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) with conditions of false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.1 and more than two times variance. It is indicated that there exists a significant difference among 23 miRNAs with respect to oral cancer cell lines and normal oral keratinocytes. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, values of 19 nucleic acids are increased and values of 4 nucleic acids are decreased with respect to an oral cancer patient and a normal person.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Further, influence of miR-196a and miR-196b for cell migration is analyzed by the invention by conducting a wound healing assay. In detail, two oral cancer cells OECM1 and SAS are detected by using antagomiR, anti-miR-196a of miR-196a, and anti-miR-196b of miR-196b in order to decrease presence level of miR-196a and miR-196b in cells. Therefore, time for cells migrating to gap in the experiment group is greater than that in the control group as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. As shown, the oral cancer cells OECM1 and SAS are detected by using scramble control (SC) and antagomiR of miR-196a and miR-196b in the wound healing assay. SC means that nucleic acid in the sequence is the same as that in the anti-sequence (e.g., antagomiR, anti-miR-196a and anti-miR-196b) but with random sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Two cell lines show reduction of miR-196 as or miR-196bs by antagomiR with decreased number in the experiment group do not fill the gap when cells in the control group fill the gap. Moreover, for proving the influence of miR-196a and miR-196b to cells migration, a great number of miR-196as and miR-196bs are present in cells as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. As shown, oral cancer cell OECM1 and SAS have transduction of particular pcDNA, miR-196a and miR-196b plasmid. The pcDNA is taken as control group. Subsequently, a wound healing assay is conducted to test cells migration capability. After 9 hours, miR-196a of oral cancer cell OECM1 moves a great distance to fill the gap but pcDNA thereof moves a less distance with the gap not being filled (see top left corner). After 9 hours, miR-196a of oral cancer cell SAS moves a great distance to fill the gap but pcDNA thereof moves a less distance with the gap not being filled (see top right corner). After 9 hours, miR-196b of oral cancer cell OECM moves a great distance to fill the gap but pcDNA thereof moves a less distance with the gap not being filled (see bottom left corner). After 9 hours, miR-196b of oral cancer cell SAS moves a great distance to fill the gap but pcDNA thereof moves a less distance with the gap not being filled (see bottom right corner). In brief, miR-196a or miR-196b can move faster than a cell's particular pcDNA of the control group.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Matrigel invasion assay is employed to determine whether miR-196a or miR-196b can change a cell's invasion capability. Two oral cancer cells OECM1 and SAS are detected by using antagomiR, anti-miR-196a and anti-miR-196b of miR-196a, and miR-196b in order to decrease presence level of miR-196a and miR-196b in cells. In detail, the oral cancer cells OECM1 and SAS are detected by using scramble control (SC) of miR-196a and miR-196b. SC means that nucleic acid in the sequence is the same as that in the anti-sequence (e.g., antagomiR, anti-miR-196a and anti-miR-196b) but with random sequence. This is best shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. In <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, anti-196a is anti-miR-196a and anti-196b is anti-miR-196b.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In the two oral cancer cells, antagonized sequence of miR-196a and miR-196b is employed to decrease the presence of miR-196a and miR-196b. Thus, the number of cells passing gel substance of substrate is less as compared with cells in the control group. As compared with cells in the experiment group, the number of OECM1 cells passing gel substance of substrate is decreased to 49% and the number of SAS cells passing gel substance of substrate is decreased to 31% in evaluating the performance of antagonizing miR-196a. Similarly, as compared with cells in the experiment group, the number of OECM1 cells passing gel substance of substrate is decreased to 34% and the number of SAS cells passing gel substance of substrate is decreased to 47% in evaluating the performance of antagonizing miR-196b. In other words, the effect of inhibiting miR-196a by using anti-miR-196a and the effect of inhibiting miR-196b by using anti-miR-196b cause a great reduction of presence levels of both OECM1 cells and SAS cells. The sequence of antagomiR can be used for developing medicine for treating oral cancer by means of the sequence of anti-miR-196a and the sequence of anti-miR-196b. Specifically, both anti-miR-196a for inhibiting miR-196a and anti-miR-196b for inhibiting miR-196b show a great reduction of OECM1 and SAS cells migration/invasion ability. The sequence of antagomiR can be combined with active ingredient to prepare a medicine which can be administered to inhibit the oral cavity cancer cell spreading. In detail, regeant is added to both antagomiR of miR-196a and miR-196b to prepare a medicine which can inhibit both miR-196a and miR-196b levels so as to effectively inhibit oral cancer cells from spreading.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Over-expression of miR-196a and miR-196b in cells in shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>. Over-expression of miR-196a and miR-196b in cells can increase the invasion capability of oral cancer cells. Next, matrigel invasion assay is employed to test the invasion capability of oral cancer cells. Further, cells having particular pcDNA are taken as control group. It is found that the number of high presence miR-196a and miR-196b passing gel substance of substrate to reach the other end of the substrate is about two times as compared with that of cells having particular pcDNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In addition to the oral cancer detection by using miR-196a and miR-196b, the invention also clinically detects presence of miR-196a and miR-196b in a tissue. 54 tumor samples (T) and adjacent normal samples (N) of a patient are detected by the invention. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a scientific technique in molecular biology to amplify a single or a few copies of a piece of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence. RT-qPCR is employed by the invention to amplify presence of miR-196a and miR-196b. Further, U6 nucleic acid is taken as internal control of normalization so that results can be expressed in relative presence. In part (A) of <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, 52 out of 54 samples (i.e., 96.3%) are tumor samples in which miR-196a is present in the tumor more than two times as that in the adjacent normal cells (i.e., p&lt;0.001). In part (B) of <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, 48 out of 54 samples (i.e., 88.6%) are tumor samples in which miR-196b is present in the tumor more than two times as that in the adjacent normal cells (i.e., p&lt;0.001).</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">For confirming whether miR-196a and miR-196b can be used clinically, the invention further detects presence of miR-196a and miR-196b in blood plasma of a patient having oral cancer and a normal person respectively. 54 samples of blood plasma of a patient having oral cancer and 33 samples of blood plasma of a normal person are taken and detected. The invention takes the following steps of detecting the presence of miR-196a and miR-196b:</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Step 1: Blood plasma is sampled. Samples have a volume of 200 Î¼l. Nucleic acid is extracted from the sample by a reagent which does not remove small RNAs. In detail, miRNeasyÂ® mini kit manufactured by 1QIAgen Inc. in Valencia, Calif. is employed. 700 Î¼l 1QIAzol is added to the sample for homogeneousness. Next, 140 Î¼l trichloromethane (i.e., chloroform) is added to the sample to extract RNAs. About 525 Î¼l of upper pure liquid is removed to a new tube after using a centrifuge. Next, 750 Î¼l pure alcohol is added to the sample to deposit nucleic acid. Further, deposits are obtained by activating the centrifuge to agitate the reagent. The sample is drained from its bottom. Next, 20 Î¼l water of RNase-free is added to the sample to extract nucleic acid from the sample.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Step 2: In a constant quantity method of nucleic acid, reverse constant poly-enzyme chain reaction reagent is employed. miRNA assays kit manufactured by ABI, in Forest City, Calif. is employed as reverse constant poly-enzyme chain reaction reagent. First, extracted 3 Î¼l nucleic acid is employed for reverse reaction. Next, 4 units of reverse reaction enzyme, 10 units of nucleic acid water soluble enzyme inhibition reagent, and 25 mM deoxy-ribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) are added to a reaction chamber having 30 Î¼l volume. The chamber is maintained at 37-degree Celsius for about 30 minutes. AMV manufactured by HT Biotech Ltd (UK) and nucleic acid soluble enzyme inhibition reagent manufactured by CalBiochem (CA, USA) are employed. Next, real time PCR detection instrument (e.g., MiniOpticon manufactured by Bio-Rad) is employed for real time constant quantity PCR. 8 Î¼l reverse reacted product and 1 Î¼l probe are mixed. Further, 1 Î¼l water and 10 Î¼l constant quantity PCR reagent are added for reaction. iQ supermix manufactured by Bio-Rad in Hercules, Calif. is employed as constant quantity PCR reagent. Results are shown as Ct value (i.e., threshold cycle) in terms of relative presence.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Results show that miR-196a in blood plasma of oral cancer patient increases significantly as compared with that of a normal person. In detail, miR-196a presence in blood plasma of an oral cancer patient is 14.27 with P&lt;0.0001 (i.e., about 14 times of that of a normal person, wherein the value of miR-196a is 1.817Â±0.38). In part (A) of <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, samples of blood plasma of a normal person and an oral cancer patient are shown in black spots. Each sample represents a relative expression (fold) of miR-196a measured by RT-qPCT. Black horizontal line represents average of the samples belonging to either a normal person or an oral cancer patient. A chi square (X<sup>2</sup>) statistic is used to investigate whether distributions of categorical variables differ from one another (i.e., samples of a normal person and that of an oral cancer patient). In part (B) of <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, a receiver operational curve (ROC) analysis is employed to evaluate the marking capability of miR-196a in both a normal person and an oral cancer patient. Area under curve (AUC) is 0.938 and it means miR-196a can be used as a reliable biomarker for detecting an oral cancer patient out of a great number of normal persons. Logistic regression model is employed to estimate that sensitivity is 92.6% and specificity is 84.6% when miR-196a is used for detecting an oral cancer patient out of a great number of normal persons.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Results further show that miR-196b in blood plasma of oral cancer patient increases significantly as compared with that of a normal person. In detail, miR-196b presence in blood plasma of an oral cancer patient is 10.03 with P&lt;0.0001 (i.e., about 10 times of that of a normal person, wherein the value of miR-196b is 7.683Â±1.88). In part (A) of <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, samples of blood plasma of a normal person and an oral cancer patient are shown in black spots. Each sample represents a relative expression (fold) of miR-196b measured by RT-qPCT. Black horizontal line represents average of the samples belonging to either a normal person or an oral cancer patient. A chi square (X<sup>2</sup>) statistic is used to investigate whether distributions of categorical variables differ from one another (i.e., samples of a normal person and that of an oral cancer patient). In part (B) of <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, a receiver operational curve (ROC) analysis is employed to evaluate the marking capability of miR-196b in both a normal person and an oral cancer patient. Area under curve (AUC) is 0.942 and it means miR-196b can be used as a reliable biomarker for detecting an oral cancer patient out of a great number of normal persons. Logistic regression model is employed to estimate that sensitivity is 90.7% and specificity is 84.9% when miR-196b is used for detecting an oral cancer patient out of a great number of normal persons.</p>
