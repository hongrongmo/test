      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to thermoplastic polycarbonate compositions (moulding compositions) impact-modified with a specially produced and worked up graft polymer, a process for the production thereof and moulded parts produced therefrom.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Thermoplastic moulding compositions comprising polycarbonates and ABS polymers have long been known. DE-A 1 170 141, for example, describes readily processable moulding compositions comprising polycarbonates and graft polymers of monomer mixtures of acrylonitrile and an aromatic vinyl hydrocarbon on polybutadiene.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In DE-A 1 810 993, the improved heat resistance of polycarbonate in admixture with ABS graft polymers or copolymers based on a-methylstyrene is emphasised.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The subject-matter of DE-A 22 59 565 and DE-A 23 29 548 is the improved flow line strength of PC/ABS moulding compositions, graft polymers of a particular particle size being used in both specifications as a constituent of the ABS component. EP-A 0 704 488 discloses thermoplastic moulding compositions having a particle diameter of 0.20 to 0.35 Î¼m.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">DE-A 28 18 679 teaches that PC/ABS mixtures exhibit particularly high low-temperature strength when the ABS polymer contains two graft copolymers having different degrees of grafting.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In addition, depending on the purity and additive content of the impact modifier, e.g. ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene terpolymer), polycarbonate compositions containing graft polymers as impact modifiers can have different stability towards hydrolysis and thermal load. Thus, B. S. Patty, L. Novak and H. Phan (in âThermal and hydrolytic stability of polycarbonate/acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene based blendsâ, Society of Automotive Engineers, [Special Publication] SP (2005), SP-1960 (Advances in Plastic Components, Processes and Technologies), 145-151) describe polycarbonate compositions which exhibit significantly better hydrolytic stability and thermal stability with bulk ABS as modifier than in the case of emulsion ABS as modifier. The different behaviour of the polycarbonate/bulk ABS compositions compared with polycarbonate/emulsion ABS compositions is attributed here to the fact that the production process for emulsion ABS requires a greater number of different chemicals as auxiliary substances, such as e.g. emulsifiers, flow improvers, stabilisers, salts etc., compared with bulk ABS, these chemicals also including ones that can lead to the decomposition of the polycarbonate. Another advantage of the polycarbonate/bulk ABS compositions is a particularly light inherent colour (natural colour), which has a particularly advantageous effect on the colouring of the mouldings consisting of these compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Certain polycarbonate compositions containing emulsion graft polymers as impact modifier have some technical advantages compared with polycarbonate compositions containing bulk ABS, e.g. in terms of the surface finish (gloss), so that it is advantageous for some applications to use emulsion graft polymers. If high hydrolytic stability is required, high demands must be placed on the emulsion graft polymers used, such as e.g. in terms of their purity, the work-up process in the production thereof and a lack of certain auxiliary substances in the production thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">From EP-A 0 900 827, for example, impact-modified polycarbonate compositions with improved thermal stability containing emulsion graft polymers are known, which are substantially free from components that degrade polycarbonate. In order to obtain an emulsion graft polymer substantially free from components that degrade polycarbonate, such components must be omitted entirely in every process step of the emulsion process or the emulsion graft polymers produced must be completely freed of these components by means of an appropriate work-up process, e.g. by washing after coagulation of the graft emulsion. In particular, the use of carboxylate-containing auxiliary substances (e.g. emulsifiers, buffer solutions) must be avoided, since these degrade polycarbonate. The polycarbonate compositions known from EP-A 0 900 827 contain emulsion graft polymers of the MBS and ABS type, which have been produced using sulfate- and/or sulfonate-containing emulsifiers. These emulsifiers often lead to undesirable discolorations of the moulding compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">From WO-A 99/01489, emulsion graft polymers of the ABS type are known, which are produced using a wide variety of emulsifiers. Common carboxylate-containing emulsifiers are mentioned inter alia as possible emulsifiers for the production thereof. This patent specification also teaches how particularly light-coloured ABS moulding compositions can be produced in which the processing and the acrylonitrile content in the graft polymer and in the matrix component (SAN resin) play a particularly important role. From WO-A 99/01489 it emerges above all that the compositions containing emulsion ABS have a particular tendency towards yellowing or even browning. This yellowing or browning is distinguished by a yellowness index from more than 30 to well above 50. The yellowness index here depends on several factors, including the rubber and acrylonitrile content of the ABS, the additives in the emulsion polymerisation and during the work-up and possibly on the purification of the graft polymer and the processing conditions of the moulding compositions and conditions during the production of the mouldings. Yellowing or brown discolouration is favoured by the high temperatures that occur e.g. during processing by injection moulding or while mixing with additives during compounding in an extruder.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">WO-A 2004/050765 teaches about the provision of impact-modified compositions with an optimised property combination of good surface quality (particularly a very low number of defects, so-called âfish eyesâ), good flow behaviour and good stress cracking resistance (ESC behaviour). To achieve this object, co-precipitated graft polymers produced by the emulsion polymerisation process were used, in which at least one graft polymer, produced by means of a redox initiation, were mixed with at least one other graft polymer, produced by means of an inorganic persulfate initiator, at the latex stage (i.e. as a polymer dispersion), and then co-precipitated and melt-compounded with the thermoplastics or a mixture of thermoplastics, including polycarbonates, polyester carbonates, polyamides and polyoxymethylene. An improvement in hydrolytic stability and in inherent colour (natural colour) of the compositions produced, particularly those compositions that contain polycarbonate, polyester carbonate and polyester, is not imparted by the teaching of WO-A 2004/050765.</p>

Another form of processing is the production of mouldings by thermoforming from previously produced sheets or films and the in-mould decoration (IMD) process.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0152">Examples of such moulded parts are films, profiles, housing parts of any type, e.g. for domestic appliances such as juice presses, coffee machines, mixers; for office equipment such as monitors, printers, copiers; interior and exterior parts for cars, panels, pipes, electrical installation channels, windows, doors and other profiles for the building sector (interior fittings and exterior applications) as well as electrical and electronic parts such as switches, plugs and sockets.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0153">In particular, the moulding compositions according to the invention can also be used for example for the production of the following moulded parts: interior fittings for rail vehicles, ships, aircraft, buses and other motor vehicles, external body parts in the automotive sector, housings of electrical equipment containing small transformers, housings for equipment for information processing and transfer, housings and claddings for medical equipment, massage equipment and housings therefor, toy vehicles for children, flat wall elements, housings for safety devices, thermally insulated transport containers, apparatus for keeping or caring for small animals, moulded parts for sanitary and bath fittings, cover grids for ventilation openings, moulded parts for summer houses and sheds and housings for garden equipment.</p>

      <p id="p-00208-en" num="0205">It is clear from the examples listed above that the impact-modified polycarbonate moulding compositions which contain an emulsion graft polymer (ABS) according to the invention as impact modifier have a good natural colour and good hydrolysis resistance if they are stabilised with a phenolic antioxidant (E-1) with optionally added synergists such as neutral organic phosphites (F-1) or thio compounds (F-2). The emulsion graft polymer (ABS) according to the invention comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of two components, one of which is polymerised by means of redox initiation and the other by means of inorganic persulfate initiation, both components having been mixed together as latices at the stage of the graft polymer dispersion and co-precipitated as a latex mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0206">In detail, the compositions 1 and 2 according to the invention display both good hydrolysis resistance (AMVR(hydr.)=105% or 112%) and a very light natural colour (YI of 19 after injection moulding at 260Â° C. melt temperature and 80Â° C. mould temperature or YI of 25 after injection moulding at 300Â° C. melt temperature and 80Â° C. mould temperature). On the other hand, the compositions of comparative examples 3, 4, 6 and 7, which contain as emulsion ABS one of the individual components (i.e. B1(1), B1(2) or B2(2)), and the composition of comparative example 5 (contains a mixture of B1(1) and B2(1), these components having been mixed together as powders and not at the stage of the graft polymer dispersions, in contrast to the present invention), exhibit a good hydrolysis resistance but exhibit, however, a significantly poorer natural colour (YI&gt;28 in each case; even after injection moulding at 260Â° C. melt temperature and 80Â° C. mould temperature).</p>
      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0207">These results discussed above are also reflected in the second test series (table 2), although because of the more severe processing conditions a poorer overall level of natural colour results, which can be explained by the longer residence time of the composition in an internal mixer than in an extruder. Thus, the results shown in table 2 also prove that the compositions according to the invention are distinguished by a good natural colour and at the same time high hydrolytic stability.</p>
      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0208">All compositions (comparative examples) containing an acidic phosphite stabiliser E-2 display both poorer hydrolysis resistance and a significantly poorer natural colour than the compositions according to the present invention, which, in contrast, contain a neutral phenolic antioxidant E-1 and optionally as synergist a neutral organic phosphite F-1 or a thio compound F-2 (cf. tables 3 and 4).</p>

Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details, and representative devices, shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
