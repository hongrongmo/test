      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Zinc oxide powder is used widely for various applications such as resins, films, and cosmetics. There is an antibacterial property as one of characteristics thereof. This antibacterial property of the zinc oxide powder gives the antibacterial property to products such as resins, films, and cosmetics.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Conventionally, zinc oxide powders to be used for various applications generally have an average particle diameter less than 1.1 Î¼m, and such particles exerts suitable antibacterial property. However, zinc oxide microparticles having an average particle diameter of 1.1 Î¼m or less are hard to disperse, and have a problem with the handleability due to low bulk specific gravity. In addition, there is a problem that the microparticles deteriorate the feelings in the cosmetic application. On the other hand, particles having the particle diameter of 1.1 Î¼m or more is preferred because the particles may be used as a thermal conductive filler when used as an additive agent in a resin. Therefore, zinc oxide powders having the particle diameter of 1.1 Î¼m or more have been developed and the use thereof for various applications has been examined, recently (Patent document 1 and 2).</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">However, zinc oxide powders, which are large particles having the average particle diameter of 1.1 Î¼m or more, have no antibacterial effect, because the antibacterial effect is relative to the specific surface area of the zinc oxide powder. Therefore, the zinc oxide powders having the average particle diameter of 1.1 Î¼m or more cannot be used for the applications requiring the antibacterial property.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">It is publicly known that the zinc oxide powders having the average particle diameter of 1.1 Î¼m or more, which are conventionally used widely, are surface treated (Patent documents 3 and 4). However, the surface treatment is performed mainly to prevent the elution of zinc ion, inhibit the chemical activity, and enhance the dispersion ability, not to improve the antibacterial performance.</p>

      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0016">The present disclosure relates to surface treated zinc oxide powders which have an average particle diameter of 1.1 Î¼m or more, and which are surface treated by using at least one compound selected from the group consisting of silicon oxide, silicone oil, organic silicon compounds, and organic titanium compounds. The antibacterial performance of zinc oxide powders having the average particle diameter of 1.1 Î¼m or more considerably decreases and have substantially no bacterial property. However, the present disclosure is completed by finding that zinc oxide having the antibacterial property can be obtained by surface treating the above-mentioned zinc oxide powder.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0017">Silicon oxide, silicone oil, organic silicon compounds, organic titanium compounds, and silica and titanium oxide obtained by heat treating them are not compounds that have an antibacterial property, individually. Furthermore, it is not publicly known that the antibacterial property of zinc oxide is enhanced by coating with the above-mentioned compounds, and knowledge of this respect is completely unknown. The present disclosure is completed by finding that an unexpected effect can be obtained by forming the coating.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0018">The present disclosure provides zinc oxide having an average particle diameter of 1.1 Î¼m or more, and having a superior antibacterial performance.

The upper limit of the average particle diameter is not particularly limited, but preferably 100 Î¼m or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0020">The surface treated zinc oxide powder of the present disclosure is obtained by surface treating with at least one compound selected from the group consisting of silicon oxide, silicone oil, organic silicon compounds, and organic titanium compounds.</p>

Therefore, it may be added as an antibacterial agent into various compositions such as cosmetics, resin compositions, and coating compositions. The surface treated zinc oxide powder is preferred because the antibacterial performance can be provided when it is used for the applications utilizing other performances of zinc oxide than the antibacterial property, for example, it is used as a thermal conductive material, an ultraviolet shielding agent and so on.

      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0054">When the thermal conductive resin composition is a resin composition for coatings, the resin does not necessarily have to have curability. The coating may be a solvent-based coating containing an organic solvent, or a water-based coating with a resin dissolved or dispersed in water.</p>

      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0059">Polyethylene resin (Sumikathene F-412-1) 100 g and sample 20 g were kneaded for 5 minutes using a twin roll heated to 115Â° C. At this time, a clearance of the twin roll was set at 0.2 mm. After kneading, the obtained composition was pressed at 100Â° C. for 10 minutes by using a steam press, and cooled to 60Â° C. to obtain a film-like composition. The composition was pressed so that the film thickness was 1 mm, and after pressing, the film-like composition was cut into a square shape having a side of 100 mm to make a test piece for an antibacterial test.</p>

On the other hand, it is clear that all of the surface treated zinc oxide powder of the present disclosure have the antibacterial performance. Furthermore, it is clear that, if silica particles are subjected to the same surface treatment, the antibacterial performance cannot be given. From these results, it is clear that the antibacterial performance is produced by the interaction occurred by surface coating the zinc oxide powder not only the silica coating.</p>
