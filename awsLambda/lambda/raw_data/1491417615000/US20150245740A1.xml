For another example, the apparatus <b>100</b> may be configured to be immobile or permanent, and the grill unit <b>110</b> may include a grill unit support structure <b>150</b> including a masonry unit or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The grill unit <b>110</b> may include a front, wherein the front of the grill unit <b>110</b> is closest to an operator while the operator customarily cooks on the grill unit <b>110</b>. The grill unit <b>110</b> may also include a back, wherein the back of the grill unit <b>110</b> is opposite the front of the grill unit <b>110</b> and/or farthest from the operator while the operator customarily cooks on the grill unit <b>110</b>. The grill unit <b>110</b> may also include a first side, wherein the first side of the grill unit <b>110</b> nominally is the side of the grill unit <b>110</b> to which the fuel-preparing unit <b>160</b> is attached. The grill unit <b>110</b> may also include a second side, wherein the second side of the grill unit <b>110</b> nominally is the side of the grill unit <b>110</b> opposite the first side of the grill unit <b>110</b> and/or to which the fuel-preparing unit <b>160</b> is not attached.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The fuel-preparing unit <b>160</b> may include, but is not limited to, a fuel-preparing unit housing <b>170</b> and a grate <b>180</b>. The grate <b>180</b> may freely stand within the fuel-preparing unit housing <b>170</b>. However, it is appreciated that the grate <b>180</b> may be supported by the fuel-preparing unit housing <b>170</b> or a component therein. The fuel-preparing unit <b>160</b> may be configured to prepare fuel including embers derived from a fuel source selected from wood, lump charcoal, charcoal briquettes, extruded charcoal, and combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> the apparatus including the grill unit in accordance with some embodiments are shown. The grill unit <b>110</b> may include a vertical space <b>112</b> partitioned into a grill space <b>112</b><i>a </i>and a grill firebox space <b>112</b><i>b</i>. The grill firebox space <b>112</b><i>b </i>corresponds to a grill firebox <b>114</b> reserved for cooking fuel such as prepared fuel (e.g., embers) and the grill space <b>112</b><i>a </i>is reserved for a grill (e.g., the grill <b>130</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The grill unit housing <b>120</b>, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, may include, but is not limited to, at least a bottom <b>121</b> that may coincide with a bottom of the grill firebox <b>114</b>. The grill unit housing <b>120</b> may also include a front wall <b>122</b> to cover a substantial portion of the grill firebox space <b>112</b><i>b </i>or the entire grill firebox space at the front of the grill unit <b>110</b>, leaving the grill space <b>112</b><i>a </i>open to the operator. According to one embodiment, the front wall <b>122</b> may include a cut-out portion for allowing easy access to the grill firebox <b>114</b> and/or contents thereof while safely containing the contents of the grill firebox <b>114</b>. The grill unit housing <b>120</b> may also include a back wall <b>124</b>, wherein the back wall <b>124</b> that may substantially cover the entire grill firebox space <b>112</b><i>b</i>. The back wall <b>124</b> may also cover a substantial portion of the grill space <b>112</b><i>a </i>or the entire grill space <b>112</b><i>a </i>at the back of the grill unit <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The grill unit housing <b>120</b> may also include a first sidewall <b>126</b>, wherein the first sidewall <b>126</b> may cover a substantial portion of the grill firebox space <b>112</b><i>b </i>or the entire grill firebox space <b>112</b><i>b</i>. For example, <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates the first sidewall <b>126</b> covering a substantial portion of the grill firebox space <b>112</b><i>b</i>, wherein the first sidewall <b>126</b> includes an opening <b>127</b> allowing transfer of the prepared fuel directly to the grill firebox <b>114</b>. The first sidewall <b>126</b> may also cover a substantial portion of the grill space <b>112</b><i>a </i>or the entire grill space <b>112</b><i>a </i>at the first side of the grill unit <b>110</b>. The grill unit housing <b>120</b> may also include a second sidewall <b>128</b> that may cover a substantial portion of the grill firebox space <b>112</b><i>b </i>or the entire grill firebox space <b>112</b><i>b</i>.
