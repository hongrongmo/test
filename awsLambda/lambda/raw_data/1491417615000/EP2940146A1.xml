    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">The purpose of the present invention is to provide: a method for preparing a cell product for use in the production of an implant, which can improve the surface properties of a material by a simple technique and can integrate a bone with a metallic implant material satisfactorily within a given period of time; a product produced by the method; and a sophisticated implant produced using the product. A cell product containing Col-I, OCN, OPN, BSP, fibronectin and VEGF or another growth factor which are produced by a bone marrow stromal cell or an immortalized milk teeth stem cell is prepared from the bone marrow stromal cell or the immortalized milk teeth stem cell, and a sophisticated implant having the growth factor immobilized on the surface thereof is provided using the resultant cell product and a mineralizing solution.</p>

      <b>Technical Field</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a sophisticated implant material using products from bone marrow stromal cells (BMCs) or immortalized dens deciduous stem cells. Specifically, it relates to the sophisticated implant material of which surface is coated with the products from the bone marrow stromal cells or immortalized dens deciduous stem cells.</p>

      <b>Background Art</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">One of an object of dental treatment is to recover lost functions of teeth and repair a shape of deficient teeth by using artificial materials. Therefore, an implant is used as the most popular treatment to repair the deficient teeth and the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Primarily, in order to function the deficient teeth and the like sufficiently with the implant, since the implant should be stabilized, it is desirable that the implant integrate with an alveolar bone. Therefore, bioactive materials such as bioglass, calcium phosphate ceramics (that is, hydroxyapatite or Ã-tricalcium phosphate) and the like have been used as these implant materials.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">From a point of view that the integration of the implant with a bone, the bioactive materials are superior in terms of their high biocompatibility. On the other hand, from a point of view of the mechanical properties such as strength or durability, metal materials are superior to the bioactive materials, because huge load is applied on the teeth. Then, Titanium (herein below, it is often referred to as "Ti") is used widely among these metal materials because of the biocompatibility, cost and so forth.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">As a technique to improve the surface properties of the implant materials, an implant having positively charged metal oxide on its surface, which may pull a cell selected from the group consisting of a human mesenchymal stem cell and osteoblast, or a protein selected from the group consisting of bovine serum albumin, fraction V, and bovine serum fibronectin, is proposed (herein below it is referred as the "prior art 1").</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Also, it is known that the integration of the metal implant with the bone depends on the bone reproducibility. Then, in order to improve the integration ability of the implant with the bone, a reagent for osteogenesis or a growth factor is applied onto the surface of the implant material. The past paper (herein below it is referred to as the "prior art 2"), it is reported that the fixed polypeptides or cells on the mucopolysaccharide-coated implant improve the osseointegration and the bone recovery after the implantation.</p>

However, there was a problem that it has insufficient integration of the implant with the bone, compared to that of the implant made of bioactive material with high biocompatibility.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Also, the material surface of the metal implant is pre-treated for activating the metal surface firstly; then it is treated with osteogenesis agent or growth factors application. Therefore, the treatment procedure is very complicated. Furthermore, the maintained period for the growth factor fixed on the surface becomes problem, when the growth factor is applied onto the material surface of the metal implant. Because, the sufficient integration cannot be desirable, if the period to maintain the growth factor on the material surface of the metal implant is short compared to that to maintain the bone and the metal implant material are integrated mutually.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Therefore, there is a strong need to develop the surface properties of the material by using a simple procedure to integrate the material with the bone sufficiently in a certain period.</p>

      <b>Mode for Carrying Out the Invention</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The present invention is explained in detail in below.</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">A preparation method of the present invention comprises the steps of: (a) preliminary culturing 5 x 10<sup>3</sup> to 5 x 10<sup>4</sup> cell/mL of the bone marrow stromal cells or immortalized dens deciduous stem cells in a medium containing 5 to 15% serum, 50 to 150 U/mL of penicillin and 50 to 150 Âµg/mL of streptomycin at a temperature from 34 to 37.5 Â°C in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>; (b) selecting the cell having both of a prescribed shape and adhesive property; and (c) culturing the cells selected in said selecting step under the same condition as that of the preliminary culturing to collect a culture supernatant after 40 to 56 hours from start of the culture.</p>

    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Here, the cell proliferation factor is general term for the polypeptide factors related to a specific cell growth, differentiation and the like, including immuno-modulating lymphokines or cytokines. It is also referred to as growth factor or cell growth factor. Herein below, the cell proliferation factor is sometimes simply referred to as the "growth factor".</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">It is known that the growth factor becomes involved in a modulation of a variety of cytological or physiological process in vivo. The growth factor binds specifically receptor proteins on the surface of the target cell (herein below, the receptor protein is simply referred to as the "receptor" or "receptor") to perform signaling.</p>
    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">As typical growth factors, there are mentioned such as epidermal growth factor (Epidermal growth factor: EGF), insulin-like growth factor (Isulin-like growth factor: IGF), transforming growth factor (Transforming growth factor : TGF), nerve growth factor (Nerve growth factor: NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor: BDNF), vesicular endothelial growth factor (Vesicular endothelial growth factor: VEGF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor: G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (Granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor: GM-CSF), platelet-derived growth factor (Platelet-derived growth factor: PDGF), erythropoietin (Erythropoietin: EPO), thrombopoietin (thrombopoietin: TPO), basic fibroblast growth factor (basic fibroblast growth factor: bFGF or FGF2), hepatocyte growth factor (Hepatocyte growth factor: HGF) and the like.</p>

    <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">B type transforming growth factor, TGF-Î², is produced in the almost all of cells such as kidney, bone marrow, platelet and the like. It has five subtypes (Î²1 to Î²5). TGF-Î²1 to Î²3 are accumulated in the bone matrix as inactive forms and activated by acid released by osteoclast in bone resorption. TGF-Î² promotes the osteoblast growth and synthesis or growth of the mesenchymal cell such as collagen. However, it rather suppresses the epidermal cell growth and osteoclast.</p>
    <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In the receptor having tyrosine kinase activity, the binding of the growth factor makes tyrosine residue phosphorylation to cause the cell growth and differentiation. Also, there is an example that the growth factor becomes the mesoderm inducer in ontogenesis.</p>
    <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The growth factors are classified into several relating families in the aspect of their structure and evolution. As these families, there are mentioned such as TGF-Î², bone morphogenic protein (bone morphogenic protein: BMP), neurotrophin (neurotrophic factor), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and the like.

It is known that the polypeptide (Î± chain) is classified into more than 30 species, and they are referred to as, for example, Î±-1(I), Î±-2(IV), and the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The collagen protein family is classified into as follows: <ol><li>1) a group including a molecule which forms filaments having periodic and striated structure of 67 nm (type I, type III, type V (in the tissue except cartilage mainly), type II and type XI (in the cartilage tissue)</li><li>2) a group including the molecule which binds on the surface of these filament (type XII, type IV (in the tissue except cartilage) and type IX (in the cartilage tissue)</li><li>3) a group including the molecule which forms web of associate (mainly type IV collagen forming a skeleton of the basement membrane), type VI forming the extracellular fine filament, and type VII forming anchoring fibril penetrating basement lamina from epidermal basal cells in the skin and the like.</li><li>4) type X which forms hexagonal lattice (it exists tentatively in the period when a cartilage changes a bone, it forms the hexagonal structure of the Descemet's membrane in cornea and it exists in the blood vessel and other tissues), type XIII, type XV, type XVII and type XVIII which have a domain penetrating the cell membrane.</li></ol></p>

It distributes widely in the connective tissue of the animal such as cartilage, bone, tendon, skin, sclera, aorta and the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) binds plasminogen activator of tissue which plays an important role in lysis of fibrin, and inhibits its function. The most important PAI is PAI-1 produced in the vascular endothelial cell, and it exists also in the platelet. Besides this, there are PAI-2 produced in the placenta and PAI-3 which inhibits active protein C (APC). An increased blood PAI-1 level causes thrombotic tendency. PAI-1 is a kind of acute phase proteins, which level is higher in afternoon compared to morning, and is positively correlated with that of blood triacylglycerol.</p>
    <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Actin (cytosolic type 2) is a protein to contract a muscle. It is thought that action mainly functions as actin filament in the cell. In a muscular cell, actin filament assembles with type II myosin to form a fascicle of actomyosin and contribute to muscular contraction power. In the non-muscular cell containing the nerve cell, the actin filament forms a variety of actin conformation such as filopodia having protrusion portion (Filopodia, filopodia), lamellipodia having the ruffling structure of the cell periphery (Lamellipodia, lamellipodia), and a stress fiber being composed of the fascicle of actomyosin associated with activated type II myosin.</p>
    <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The reorganization of the actin structure is controlled under the intracellular signaling spatiotemporal specifically through low molecular weight G-protein belonging to Rho family. It plays the important role in the dynamic control of cell morphology such as cell movement or cell division. Simultaneously, the reorganization contributes to the vesicle transport along the actin filament through the binding with the atypical myosin. In addition to these dynamic roles, the actin filament accumulates under the immediately beneath the cell membrane to form the undercoat of cell-cortex (cell cortex), or supports the intercellular adhesion by binding with the cadherin, which is the cell adhesion molecules, through Î±-catenin or vinculin.</p>

    <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Metalloproteinases inhibitor (TIMP, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase) is an endogenous inhibitor which controls the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (matrix metalloproteinase: MMP). MMP is belonging to zinc metalloproteinase family, and controls the metabolism of extracellular matrix secreted from the cells. At present, it is known that there are TIMP and TINP1 to 4, which have the different inhibition pattern respectively, and express at different level in every tissue depending on the inflow of MMP. TIMP-1 and -2 bind to many active site of MMP and inhibit their activity irreversibly. Also, these two TIMP affect a variety of cell directly to show growth-stimulating activity.</p>

It is said that the dental pulp cell is covered by tooth made from hard material, which is lightproof against ultraviolet ray or radioactive ray so that the gene included in it is not easily wounded.</p>
    <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">An immortalized dental pulp stem cell is the immortalized cell of dental pulp stem cell derived from dens deciduous. The dental pulp stem cell is a kind of stem cell contained in the nerve of the tooth. It is said that the dental pulp cell is covered by tooth made from hard material, which is lightproof against ultraviolet ray or radioactive ray so that the gene included in it is not easily wounded.</p>
    <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The immortalized stem cell is produced as follows. At first, an exfoliate dens deciduous is sterilized with antiseptic solution such as chlorhexidine, Isodine and others. After that, if the femur of the animal is used as a source, the bone marrow cell is taken out by using the syringe, which is filled with PBS or the like, with injection needle of which outside diameter tightly matches with the medullar cavity of the femur, so as to extrude the bone marrow cells from the medullar cavity. Also, when the swine tooth or human exfoliate dens deciduous are used as the cell source, the dental crown is divided respectively, and collect the dental pulp tissue with dental reamer.</p>
    <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">The obtained bone marrow stromal cells or dental pulp tissues are suspended in the basal medium, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (herein below, it is referred to as "DMEM") containing 5 to 15 % of calf serum (herein below, it is sometimes referred to as "CS") and 50 to 150 unit/ml of antibiotics. After that, the cells are treated with 1 to 5 mg/ml of collagenase and 1 to 5 mg/ml of dispase at 37 Â°C for 0.5 to 2 hours.</p>
    <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">As the basal medium, there are mentioned, for example, DMEM; it is used with fetal bovine serum is supplemented, and after treatment with an enzyme, the medium is centrifuged (3,000 to 7,000 rpm) for 3 to 10 minutes to collect the dental pulp cells. As needed, the cells are sorted by using a cell strainer. The sorted cells are resuspended with 3 to 6 ml of the basal medium, and are plated in the dish for adherent cell culture, of which dish having 4 to 8 cm in diameter.</p>
    <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The medium, for example, DMEM containing 10% FCS is added to the dish, then, it is incubated in the incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37 Â°C for about 2 weeks, for example, while exchanging the medium every few days. During the incubation, passage is performed 2 to 4 times. After confirming the cell becomes sub-confluent, the medium is removed and the cells are washed with PBS and the like from 1 time to several times. Instead of removing the medium and washing the cells, adherent dental pulp stem cells formed colonies may be collected. The adherent dental pulp stem cells are treated, for example, with 0.025 to 0.1% trypsin and 0.3 to 1 mM of EDTA at 37 Â°C for several minutes to release. Then, the cells are collected.</p>
    <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In the case of the dental pulp stem cell, after treating with the enzyme, the cells are centrifuged (3,000 to 7,000 rpm) for 3 to 10 minutes to be recovered. As needed, the cells are sorted with the cell strainer. The sorted cells are resuspended in the 3 to 6 ml of the basal medium, and plated into the dish with 4 to 8 cm in diameter for adherent cell culture.</p>
    <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">After that, the medium, for example, DMEM containing 10% FCS is added into the dish for the desired periods as mentioned above. The cells are washed with PBS and the like for 1 time to several times to obtain the adherent cells.</p>
    <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">In the case of using the rat bone marrow cells, it is preferable that a bone fluid obtained from the marrow space of the rat femur (about 30 to 100 Âµg/femur) is added into DMEM, which contains about 5 to 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin (provided from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) to be incubated in the incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37 Â°C by 2 to 4 passages of the preliminary incubation to select the cells having desired properties.</p>
    <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">For example, the bone fluid (about 50 ÂµL/femur) is added into DMEM including 10% FBS, penicillin and streptomycin of the above mentioned concentrations in the incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37 Â°C through 3 passages of the preliminary incubation to select the cells having the spindle shape, adherent properties and the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">As mentioned above, the sorted adherent cells (the stem cells) are obtained. After that, for example, the stem cells are plated into the dish for adherent cell culture to be incubated under the condition of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37 Â°C.</p>
    <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">When the BMSCs obtained from the femur are used, the cells having the spindle shape and adherent properties are solely selected and used.</p>
    <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">In passage culture, for example, the cells are collected by using trypsin and EDTA as mentioned above, when the cells become sub-confluent or confluent with macroscopic observation. Then, the cells are plated again in the culture dish including the culture medium.</p>
    <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">Here, the term, "sub-confluent", means the situation that the cells adhere about 70 % of the area of the culture vessel on which the cells should be adhered. For example, the passage is performed from 1 time to 8 times to select the cells, which are grown up to achieve the necessary cell number, for example, about 1 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL. After culturing as described above, the cells are collected to store in liquid nitrogen. The cells collected from a variety of donors may be stored in the form of dental pulp stem cell bank.</p>
    <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">When the immortalized stem cells are prepared, primarily cultured cells are obtained through primary culture of the stem cell obtained as mentioned above. Genes, hTERT, bmi-1, E6 and E7, are introduced into the primarily cultured cell as follows. A plasmid to introduce these genes is prepared, and it is integrated into a shuttle vector such as pShuttle2 for cloning the genes. E.coli is transformed by using the shuttle vector to select kanamycin-resistant transformant. The plasmid DNA in the kanamycin-resistant transformant is purified and the recombinant is identified by analyzing restriction sites.</p>
    <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">Next, restriction enzymes, for example, PI-Sce I and I-Cue I are used to cut out an expression cassette from the shuttle vector for ligating it into adenovirus vector, for example, Adeno-X viral DNA. Obtained ligation product is cleaved by using Swa I, and it is used to transform the E. coli.</p>
    <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">Here, hTERT is the gene for telomere repair enzyme; bmi-1 is the gene of Bmi-1, which is one of proteins being composed of polycomb group complex. Here, Bmi-1 is necessary for maintaining the hematopoietic stem cells with the action to increase the stem cell number by enhancing the activities.</p>
    <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">Both E6 and E7 are early genes of either HPV-16 or HPV-18. Also, Oct3/4 is the gene that cooperates with Sox2 to activate the transcription of the target gene. Klf4 (Kruppel type transcription factor 4) modulates the genes relating to the cell division and the embryogenesis, and it relates to the gastrointestinal system cancer as the tumor inhibition factor.</p>
    <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">Sox2 is belonging to SRY-related HMG box gene family, and it is known as the gene got involved in the maintenance of undifferentiated functions of the cells (pluripotency). c-Myc is an oncogenic gene, and it promotes both of survival and death of the cell in the c-Myc-induced tumor. p16INK4a is the gene which plays important role to control the cell cycle of the tumor cell.</p>
    <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">Among the transformant obtained, the ampicillin resistant transformants are selected. The recombinant adenovirus DNA, in which the genes as mentioned above are integrated, is purified to identify the recombinant by analyzing the restriction enzyme sites.</p>
    <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">After that, the recombinant adenovirus is digested by using Pac-I to be transfected into HEK293 cells. The recombinant adenovirus is grown, and then they are collected to determine the titer of them. According to the conventional method, the virus is purified. Then, they are passed to SHED as target cell.</p>
    <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">The virus infected cells are stained by using FITC according to the common procedure to detect STRO-1 positive cell by using a flow cytometer. Here, STRO-1 is thought as one of makers for the mesenchymal stem cell having the pluripotency in the bone marrow, and it becomes an index of immortalization of the cell.</p>
    <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">According to the procedure stated above, the bone marrow stromal cell, the dental pulp cell and the immortalized dens deciduous stem cell derived from dental pulp are obtained.</p>
    <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">It is preferable to use the bone marrow stromal cell, the dental pulp cell and the immortalized dens deciduous stem cell derived from rat, swine or human dens deciduous, because the source for these cell are available easily and the cells stably producing the growth factor as mentioned above are obtained. Also, these cells are preferably incubated at 37 Â°C in the preliminary culture step of (a).</p>
    <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Also, the cells having the spindle shape, fusiform, and adherence property are preferably sorted in the cell sorting step. Moreover, it is preferable to collect the culture supernatant after 44 to 52 hours from the incubation start, because the cells having the spindle shape, fusiform and the adherence property are abundantly contained in them. Also, it is more preferable to collect the culture supernatant after 48 hours from the incubation start, because the cells having higher adherence property are obtained.</p>
    <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">The culture supernatant preferably contains at least type I collagen, fibronectin, decorin, vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and bone sialoprotein (BSP), in which these proteins are produced by the sorted cells, because the integration of the metal implant material and the bone is promoted. The culture supernatant preferably further contains at least one of protein selected from the group consisting of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7, follistatin-related protein, metalloproteinase inhibitor I, tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor, actin, sulfhydryl oxidase I, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and TGF-Î², because the integration of the metal implant material and bone is further promoted.</p>
    <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">Next, at the preparation step of the precipitate, the culture supernatant as mentioned above is centrifuged to subject to ethanol precipitation to prepare the precipitate. For example, the cells are centrifuged from 1,000 to 2,000 rpm for 3 to 10 minutes, from 2,500 to 3,500 rpm for 1 to 5 minutes, in the range from 0 to 10 Â°C to remove unnecessary cells. After that, about 8 to 12 times volume of ethanol is added to the centrifuged supernatant, and then it is incubated at -5 to 15 Â°C for 30 to 90 minutes. Subsequently, the supernatant is centrifuged at from 10,000 to 20,000 for 10 to 20 minutes at from 2 to 6 Â°C to obtain the precipitate by removing the supernatant. After that, the precipitate obtained by the precipitate preparing step is lyophilized. For example, the precipitate is resuspended in 80 to 95% cold ethanol to centrifuge at from 10,000 to 20,000 rpm for 10 to 20 minutes at from 2 to 6 Â°C to remove the supernatant. The precipitate is frozen at from -60 to 90 Â°C to be lyophilized.</p>
    <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">According to the above method, the product of the cell as mentioned above is obtained. The obtained cell product is preferably preserved at from -20 to -40 Â°C, from the view point of the retention of the activity.</p>
    <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">Then, the sophisticated implant is produced by using the lyophilized product obtained as mentioned above as follows. Specifically, it is produced by using the method comprising the steps of (f) washing the surface of the implant material by using an organic solvent to be washed implant material, (g) immersing said washed implant material in calcification solution having predetermined composition at predetermined temperature for 3 to 6 hours to be immersed implant material, and (h) treating said immersed implant material by using the in the solution comprising the cell product with predetermined concentration.</p>
    <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">Here, it is preferable that said implant material is manufactured by any one of the material selected from the group consisting of titanium, zirconia, hydroxyapatite, and Î²-TCP, because they have excellent compatibility to the biological tissue and processability, and they may be easily obtained. Among them, it is more preferable to use titanium (Ti), because it is easily processed by using the culture supernatant of the stem cell, and highly efficient.</p>
    <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">Also, acetone and from 60 to 80% ethanol (v/v) is preferably used as the organic solvent, because it shows high washing effect to the implant material surface. Also, the ethanol content is set to 60 to 80 %, because the organic solvent has weak detergency when the ethanol content is less than 60%, and higher washing effect is not shown over 80 %. About 70% ethanol is preferably used.</p>
    <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">Next, the implant material washed as described above is immersed in the calcification solution having the predetermined composition for 3 to 6 hour. It is preferable that the composition of the first calcification solution contains 100 to 150 mM of NaCl, 2.5 to 3.5 mM of CaCl<sub>2</sub>Â·H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.5 to 2.5 mM of K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 25 to 75 mM of Tris-HCl (pH 7.2 to 7.6), from the view point of the calcification efficiency. It is further preferable that the solution contains 136.8 mM NaCl, 3.10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>Â·H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.86 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), because the calcification efficiency is high.</p>
    <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">Here, the immersing time period is set to 3 to 6 hours, because the calcification effect is insufficient less than 3 hours, and no further calcification effect is obtained over 6 hours. It is preferable that the immersing time period set to 4 hours, because of sufficient calcification.</p>
    <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">Also, the immersion is preferably performed at from 36 to 38 Â°C, because it becomes priming for the immersion in the second calcification solution described in below. It is more preferable that the immersion is performed at 37 Â°C.</p>
    <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">The implant material, which is subjected to the immersion treatment as mentioned above, is incubated in the second calcification solution containing the culture at the predetermined concentration for the predetermined time period; thereby Col-I, BSP, VEGF and other growth factors are attached on the implant material. The second calcification solution preferably contains 130 to 160 mM of KNO<sub>3</sub>, 1 to 2 mM of Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Â·4H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.5 to 1.5 mM of K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> (pH 7.0 to 7.8), because these proteins attach highly efficiently.</p>
    <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">Specifically, the implant material is preferably incubated in in the solution containing 142.8 mM of KNO<sub>3</sub>, 1.5 mM of Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Â·4H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.9 mM of K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> (pH 7.4), including 5 to 20 mg/ ml of lyophilized cell culture (cell products) obtained as described above, at room temperature for 2 to 5 days; because the sufficient amounts of the growth factors are attached on the surface of the implant. It is more preferable that the incubation time is for 3 days, because the sophisticated implant is efficiently produced.</p>
    <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">Here, the solution having the concentration of the product less than 5 mg/mL causes the problem that the amounts of the growth factor attached on the implant is insufficient and they gives weak adhesion property with the alveolar bone. On the other hand, the solution having the concentration over 20 mg/mL does not give much higher adhesion property. It is more preferable that the implant material is treated by using the solution including the concentration at 10 mg/ml of them to give sufficient adhesion to alveolar bone.</p>
    <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">As described above, the sophisticated implant is obtained having at least Col-I, bone sialoprotein (BSP) and VEGF on its surface. When the implant further comprises IGF-1, HGF and TGF-Î² on its surface, it gives highly improved stability; because they promote the integration of implant with the in a short time.</p>
