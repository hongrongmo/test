      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present technology relates to a method for producing a thermoplastic elastomer composition. More specifically, the present technology relates to a method for producing a thermoplastic elastomer composition having excellent low-temperature durability, a thermoplastic elastomer composition produced by the method, and a product obtained from the thermoplastic elastomer composition.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">There are known thermoplastic elastomer compositions having an excellent balance of air permeation resistance and flexibility, the compositions being obtained by dispersing a specific elastomer component into a specific thermoplastic resin matrix as a discontinuous phase (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application No. H08-259741A).</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">For example, a thermoplastic resin elastomer composition produced by melt-kneading a modified polyamide resin, an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, and a maleic anhydride modified ethylene-propylene copolymer with a twin screw kneader and an example in which a pneumatic tire using a film consisting of the composition as an inner liner is produced have been reported (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2010-132850A).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The elastomer component in a thermoplastic elastomer composition originally has an effect of improving the low-temperature durability of the thermoplastic elastomer composition. However, when producing an thermoplastic elastomer composition by melt-kneading a thermoplastic resin and an elastomer with a twin screw kneader, there has been a problem in that simply increasing the elastomer ratio causes the proportion of coarse elastomer particles to increase without the elastomer being finely dispersed in the thermoplastic resin, which prevents the original low-temperature durability improving effect from being sufficiently expressed.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">As a result of conducting extensive research, the present inventors discovered that when an elastomer is fed in a divided manner into the twin screw kneader in a method for producing a thermoplastic elastomer composition using a twin screw kneader, the kneaded product is cooled by the elastomer that is injected later, and the viscosities of the thermoplastic resin and the elastomer approach one another, which causes the elastomer to be finely dispersed in the thermoplastic resin and makes it possible to achieve the desired low-temperature durability improving effect.</p>

      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Of these, at least one type selected from the group consisting of ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymers, polyamide resins, and polyester resins is preferable from the perspective of air blocking performance.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In order to improve processability, dispersibility, heat resistance, oxidation resistance, or the like, the thermoplastic resin used in the present technology may contain additive ingredients that are generally blended into thermoplastic resin compositions, such as fillers, reinforcing agents, processing aids, stabilizers, and antioxidants, to an extent that does not inhibit the effects of the present technology. A plasticizer should not be added from the perspectives of gas barrier properties and heat resistance, a plasticizer may be added to an extent that does not inhibit the effects of the present technology.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Elastomers that can be used in the present technology are not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected in accordance with the application of the thermoplastic elastomer composition.

      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Of these, at least one type selected from the group consisting of brominated isobutylene-p-methyl styrene copolymers, ethylene-Î±-olefin copolymers, ethylene-glycidyl methacrylate copolymers, ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymers, and modified products thereof is preferable from the perspective of durability or processability.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The elastomer used in the present technology may contain additive ingredients that are generally blended into elastomer compositions, such reinforcing agents (fillers) such as carbon black or silica, softening agents, antioxidants, and processing aids, to an extent that does not inhibit the effects of the present technology.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The method for producing a thermoplastic elastomer composition according to the present technology is implemented using a twin screw kneader. The L/D of the twin screw kneader is not particularly limited as long as the present technology can be implemented but preferably satisfies LD=30 to 60. Here, L is the length of the screw of the twin screw kneader in the axial direction, and D is the cylinder inside diameter.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The twin screw kneader used in the present technology has at least two raw material inlets including a first raw material inlet and a second raw material inlet. The second raw material inlet is provided at a position separated by 15 D to 38 D on the downstream side from the first raw material inlet, where D is the cylinder inside diameter of the twin screw kneader, and preferably separated by 18 D to 32 D on the downstream side from the first raw material inlet.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">At least one kneading zone is respectively provided between the first and second raw material inlets and further downstream from the second raw material inlet in the twin screw kneader used in the method of the present technology. In the kneading zone, the thermoplastic resin and the elastomer are melt-kneaded. The length of each zone in the cylinder axis direction of the twin screw kneader is from 0.5 D to 20 D and preferably from 1.0 D to 10 D. When the length is shorter than 0.5 D, kneading is insufficient, and the elastomer is not sufficiently dispersed in the thermoplastic resin, which diminishes the durability and extrusion moldability. In addition, when the length is longer than 20 D, the thermoplastic resin and the elastomer are excessively kneaded, which causes gel particles or decreases in fluidity and diminishes processability.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The melt kneading temperature in each kneading zone is a temperature of at least the melting point of the thermoplastic resin but is preferably a temperature 20Â° C. higher than the melting point of the thermoplastic resin such as from 120 to 250Â° C., for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The kneading time is not particularly limited but is preferably from 3 to 15 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In the method of the present technology, the elastomer is fed in a divided manner from the first and second raw material inlets. The proportion of the elastomer fed from the second raw material inlet is from 10 vol % to 60 vol % and preferably from 10 vol % to 30 vol % of the total amount of the elastomer. When the proportion is less than 10 vol %, sufficient durability cannot be achieved. In addition, when the proportion is greater than 60 vol %, kneading is not performed sufficiently, so the proportion of coarse rubber particles increases, and the processability and durability are diminished.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In order to obtain a thermoplastic elastomer composition having the desired low-temperature durability in the method of the present technology, the temperature (A) of the elastomer fed from the second raw material inlet of the twin screw kneader is preferably at least 100Â° C. lower and more preferably from 130Â° C. to 230Â° C. lower than the resin temperature (T) of the cylinder tip discharge part at the time of kneading. When the elastomer is fed at a temperature A at least 100Â° C. lower than T, the kneaded product is sufficiently cooled, and the viscosities of the thermoplastic resin and the elastomer approach one another, which causes the elastomer to be finely dispersed in the thermoplastic resin and makes it possible to achieve the desired low-temperature durability improving effect.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The total amount of the elastomer used in the method of the present technology is preferably at least 30 parts by volume and more preferably from 50 to 70 parts by volume per 100 parts by volume of the total amount of the thermoplastic resin and the elastomer.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The feeding location of the thermoplastic resin in the present technology is not particularly limited, and the thermoplastic resin may be fed all at once or in a divided manner. Preferably, at least part of the thermoplastic resin is fed from the first raw material inlet or from a third raw material inlet provided upstream from the first raw material inlet. For example, the thermoplastic resin may be fed all at once from the first raw material inlet or fed all at once from the third raw material inlet, or part of the thermoplastic resin may be fed from the third raw material inlet and the remaining thermoplastic resin may then be fed from the first raw material inlet. Alternatively, part of the thermoplastic resin may be fed from the first raw material inlet or the third raw material inlet and the remaining thermoplastic resin may then be fed from a raw material inlet such as the second raw material inlet, for example, provided downstream from the first raw material inlet. For example, when thermoplastic resins A and B of different types are used, both of the resins A and B may be fed all at once from the first raw material inlet or fed all at once from the third raw material inlet, or the resin A (or the resin B) may be fed from the third raw material inlet and the resin B (or the resin A) may then be fed from the first raw material inlet. Alternatively, the resin A (or the resin B) may be fed from the first raw material inlet or the third raw material inlet and the resin B (or the resin A) may then be fed from a raw material inlet such as the second raw material inlet, for example, provided downstream from the raw material inlet.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The elastomer constituting the dispersion phase of the thermoplastic elastomer composition is preferably crosslinked by means of dynamic crosslinking. By dynamically crosslinking the elastomer, it is possible to fix the matrix phase and the dispersion phase of the thermoplastic elastomer composition. Dynamic crosslinking can be performed by melt-kneading a non-crosslinked elastomer together with a crosslinking agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Examples of the crosslinking agent used in dynamic crosslinking include zinc oxide, stearic acid, zinc stearate, magnesium oxide, m-phenylene bismaleimide, alkyl phenol resins and halides thereof, secondary amines (for example, N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-Nâ²-phenyl-p-phenylene diamine or polymerized 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline), and tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)isocyanurate. Of these, zinc oxide, stearic acid, zinc stearate, N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-Nâ²-phenyl-p-phenylene diamine, and tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)isocyanurate are preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The amount of the crosslinking agent is preferably from 0.5 to 4.0 parts by mass and more preferably from 1.0 to 2.0 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the total amount of the elastomer.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The crosslinking agent is fed from a crosslinking agent inlet provided between the first raw material inlet and the second raw material inlet, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The thermoplastic elastomer composition produced by the method of the present technology is then extruded in a shape such as a film shape, a sheet shape, or a tube shape by an ordinary method from a die attached to the discharge port of the twin screw kneader in the molten state, or the composition is extruded in a strand shape and temporarily pelletized with a resin pelletizer, and the obtained pellets are then formed into a desired film shape, sheet shape, or tube shape in accordance with the application using an ordinary resin molding method such as inflation molding, calendar molding, or extrusion molding.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present technology demonstrates excellent low-temperature durability and fatigue resistance in addition to excellent gas blocking properties, so the composition can be suitably used as an air permeation prevention layer such as an inner liner, for example, of a pneumatic tire, for example, or can be suitably used as an air blocking layer of a hose.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present technology can also be laminated with a tacky adhesive composition so as to form a laminate. The tacky adhesive composition preferably has excellent adhesion with the rubber constituting the pneumatic tire. Although the composition is not particularly limited, examples include compositions containing epoxidized styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymers, zinc oxide, stearic acid, vulcanization accelerators, and tackifiers. A laminate of the thermoplastic elastomer composition and a tacky adhesive composition can be produced, for example, by coextruding the thermoplastic elastomer composition and the tacky adhesive composition. Since a laminate of the thermoplastic elastomer composition and a tacky adhesive composition has excellent adhesion with the rubber constituting the pneumatic tire, the laminate can be suitably used as an air permeation prevention layer such as an inner liner, for example, of the pneumatic tire.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">A commonly used method can be used as the method for producing a pneumatic tire using a film consisting of the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present technology. For example, the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present technology is molded into a film having a prescribed width and thickness, and this is attached in a cylindrical shape to a drum for tire molding. Tire members such as a carcass layer, a belt layer, and a tread layer are sequentially attached and layered thereon, and the green tire is removed from the drum for tire molding. Next, by vulcanizing this green tire in accordance with a conventional method, it is possible to produce a desired pneumatic tire using a film using the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present technology.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">A commonly used method can be used as the method for producing a hose using a film consisting of the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present technology. For example, the thermoplastic elastomer composition of the present technology is extruded onto a mandrel coated with a mold release agent in advance using a cross-head extrusion method with an extruder so as to form an inner tube, and reinforcing threads or reinforcing steel wires are braided on the inner tube using a braiding machine to form a reinforcing layer. The thermoplastic resin is further extruded onto the reinforcing layer to form an outer tube. A layer consisting of another thermoplastic resin and/or an adhesive may also be provided as necessary between the inner tube and the reinforcing layer and between the reinforcing layer and the outer tube. Finally, a hose is obtained when the mandrel is pulled out.</p>
