      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to an ultrasound image acquisition station for use together with a mobile display device to form an ultrasound imaging system. Further, the present invention relates to an ultrasound imaging system for providing an image of area tomographic plane or volume, for example an anatomical view within a body of a patient.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Ultrasound imaging systems are widely known in the art. They are in particular used to provide anatomical imaging of patients. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional imaging of bodies of patients is known to provide a reliable tool for medical practitioners to view parts of a body of a patient without the need for any surgical steps.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Ultrasound imaging systems are complete stations that may be fixed to a certain location and are often movable on rollers to provide flexible use in different locations. The ultrasound imaging systems provide for every component needed to acquire ultrasound images, i.e. input devices, display devices, any computer hardware needed to run the ultrasound imaging system and the specific software for acquiring, rendering and displaying the ultrasound images. Further, the ultrasound imaging systems comprise at least one probe, carrying one- or two-dimensional transducer arrays to scan the body of a patient either manually or automatically.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Of course, providing fully set up ultrasound imaging systems comprising every component as mentioned above makes these systems not only relatively costly but also large, heavy and inconvenient to move in medical locations.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Further, mobile computational devices are commonly known and have spread throughout clinical applications in the last couple of years. Nowadays, mobile phones, tablets, personal computers and notebooks are largely used to provide all kinds of applications and network access independent of their location. These mobile devices have steadily increasing hardware performance levels, easy to use interfaces, and displays with increasing resolution and quality.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Recent developments have enhanced the functionality of such mobile devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">For example, reference JP 2007129342 A discloses a mobile phone with a personal computer function including an interface connectable to an external device for storing personal computer operating systems, an internal storage means for storing a mobile phone operating system, a controlling means for controlling execution of a program on the basis of the mobile phone operating system, a judgment means for judging whether or not the external device is connected to the interface, and a switching means for switching the mobile phone operating system to the personal computer operating system when the judgment means judges that the external device is connected to the interface, wherein the control means controls execution of the program on the basis of the personal computer operating system when the personal computer operating system is selected.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">There is a need to further improve ultrasound imaging systems in terms of costs, portability and multipurpose functionality.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved ultrasound image acquisition station and an improved ultrasound imaging system.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In a first aspect of the present invention, an ultrasound image acquisition station for use together with a mobile display device to form an ultrasound imaging system is presented that comprises a transducer array configured to provide an ultrasound receive signal, an image acquisition hardware assembly for controlling the transducer array, receiving the ultrasound receive signal and providing image data, a first memory unit having stored thereon a first operating system for operating the ultrasound imaging system, and an interface assembly for connecting the mobile display device with the ultrasound image acquisition station.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In a further aspect of the present invention an ultrasound imaging system for providing an image of area tomographic or volume is presented that comprises an ultrasound image acquisition station comprising a transducer array configured to provide an ultrasound receive signal, an image acquisition hardware assembly for controlling the transducer array, receiving the ultrasound receive signal and providing image data, a first memory unit having stored thereon a first operating system for operating the ultrasound imaging system, and an interface assembly for connecting the mobile display device with the ultrasound image acquisition station, and wherein the ultrasound imaging system further comprises a mobile display device, wherein the mobile display device has a second memory unit having stored thereon a second operating system for operating the mobile display device, and wherein the mobile display device is connectable to the interface assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The basic idea of the invention is to make use of the hardware resources and the portability of widespread mobile display devices to enable commanding of ultrasound imaging systems and processing ultrasound image data.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">It is contemplated to temporarily replace an operating system of a mobile display device to provide a dedicated ultrasound imaging function for a defined period. The commandeered central processing unit and rendering hardware of the mobile display device run the ultrasound application exclusively, yielding higher performance and diagnostic reliability. When scanning is initiated, the ultrasound operating system is inserted into the mobile display device. When scanning is completed, the mobile display device is returned to its original operating system and function.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">By this, a single target mobile display device can safely serve multiple purposes, one of which is restricted to exclusive ultrasound image processing. The other purpose may be for the common general purposes of the user. Further, these general purposes may include additional medical purposes, for example within a clinic or other location for medical aid. Having a single mobile display device reduces the costs of ownership and the clutter of otherwise dedicated scanning devices. Further, the effective portability of the ultrasound imaging system is enhanced, since the user is already carrying his/her personal computer. Because the ultrasound imaging application enjoys sole access to the resources of the mobile display device, it can reliably claim to generate valid evaluable ultrasound images and to store or transfer those images securely.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In particular, the first memory unit is a non-transitory storage device on which data executing a first operating system for operating all hardware components of the ultrasound imaging system is stored. By this, the first memory unit presents an alternate boot drive to the mobile display device. Preferably, there is a rapid start-up provided by a mechanism such as the Hibernate-Once-Resume-Many (HORM) boot sequence. Such a HORM feature allows for a rapid reboot and return to the same hibernated operation over and over again. A version of an ultrasound operating system may be rapidly booted from the predefined hibernation state. The ultrasound imaging system can be booted to an operating state from zero-power-standby in approximately seven seconds.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Hence, there is provided the ultrasound image acquisition station comprising all hardware necessary for an ultrasound image acquisition. Further, it is configured to connect to a mobile display device a first memory unit having stored thereon the first operating system. In particular, the first memory unit may be a flash memory device. Further, the ultrasound image acquisition station may comprise a judging means for judging if a mobile display device is connected to the ultrasound image acquisition station via the interface assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Furthermore, the ultrasound image acquisition station may comprise switching means for switching, in particular automatically switching, the operation of the mobile display device towards operation via the first operating system upon judging that a mobile display device is connected to the ultrasound image acquisition station by the judging unit. The ultrasound image acquisition station may be in the form of a standard attachment to a mobile display device via its docking port. It may be a kind of a sleeve surrounding the mobile display device and carried with the mobile display device, or may have the form of a typical table-top docking station, or may have the form of a docking port connector cabled to or part of a smart probe carrying the transducer array, the image acquisition hardware assembly and the first memory unit. Hence, in the case of a smart probe, all ultrasound specific hardware, i.e. at least the beam former, and, optionally, the signal processor and, further optionally the image processor, may be contained in the handle of the probe, including the first memory unit containing the first operating system. The smart probe or the image acquisition station may connect to the mobile display device by means of a custom wired interface, a standard wired interface such as universal serial bus (USB), USB 2.0, USB 3.0 or a wireless interface such as wireless USB on an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio link. In the case of a wireless smart probe, a battery may also be included in the smart probe, and the entire smart probe should optimally consume less than an average of 3.5 watts during scanning operation.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined in the dependent claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In an embodiment, the image acquisition hardware assembly has a beam former configured to control the transducer array to scan area two-dimensional tomographic plane or a three-dimensional volume, in particular of a body of a patient, and further configured to receive the ultrasound receive signal and to provide an image signal, and a signal processor configured to receive the image signal and to provide image data. By this, the ultrasound image acquisition station can provide full ultrasound hardware functionality to command the transducer array and can provide image data to the mobile display device via the interface assembly that can be further processed by the mobile display device. All ultrasound specific hardware and/or software components are provided in the ultrasound image acquisition station.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In a further embodiment, the ultrasound image acquisition station further comprises a first input device for enabling a user to command the ultrasound imaging system. By this, further possibilities to input data and to the ultrasound imaging system and to control the ultrasound imaging system can be provided to a user. For example, in case the mobile display device only has a touch screen, a keyboard can be provided to the user via the input device of the ultrasound image acquisition system to enable the user to readily input the name of the patient, information related to the ultrasound images, etc. via the keyboard. Further, the first input device may comprise a trackball for steering a mouse pointer on the mobile display device, or to scan, enlarge and rotate a rendered three-dimensional image in case a volume is scanned via the ultrasound imaging system. For example, physical buttons implementing basic ultrasound functions such as to start and stop active imaging, or to set the image depth, may be included in the ultrasound image acquisition station. In general, all input possibilities can be provided to a user further to the input possibilities that may be provided by a mobile display device.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In a further embodiment, the ultrasound image acquisition station further comprises a docking unit comprising the image acquisition hardware assembly, the first memory unit and the interface assembly. By this, the ultrasound image acquisition station can be provided to the user as a docking unit for receiving the mobile display device. Placing the mobile display device in the bottom station can provide an intuitive and apparently easy procedure for connecting the mobile display device with the ultrasound image acquisition station.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In a further embodiment, the ultrasound image acquisition station further comprises a probe head that comprises the transducer array. By this, usual probe heads can be connected to the docking unit. Further, the patient may be scanned manually in case the probe head can be manually operated. However, it may also be the case that the probe head is part of a more complex device that may be placed on a portion of a body of a patient to automatically scan a larger volume of the patient, for example the torso, the heart or a breast of a patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In a further embodiment, the probe head is cable-connected to the docking station. By this, a reliable connection being able to provide for the transmittal of large bandwidth can be provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In a further embodiment, the ultrasound image acquisition station further comprises an adapter unit, wherein the interface assembly is configured as a plug and socket connection, and wherein the adapter unit is designed to enable connection of a specific type of mobile display device to the interface assembly. By this, the mobile display device may be easily connected to the ultrasound image acquisition station and its docking unit. The adapter unit may facilitate connection of the mobile display device. Further, the adapting unit may serve to securely hold the mobile display device attached to the docking unit during operation.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In a further embodiment, the docking unit is generally L-shaped in cross section. By this, the docking unit may be provided in the form of a plate with a smooth angled foot feature in the back which forms a combination of hook, stand and transducer interface. One or more, preferably two, interfaces for transducer arrays may be provided within the angled feature of the docking unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In a further embodiment of the ultrasound imaging system, the ultrasound imaging system is configured such that the second operating system is bypassed and the mobile display device is operated by the first operating system upon connection of the mobile display device to the docking station. By this, the mobile display device becomes dedicated to the ultrasound scanner function when docked. The mobile display device will be booted into the hibernated state of the first operating system within seconds, providing the full hardware resources to the ultrasound imaging procedure.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In a further embodiment, the mobile display device comprises a central processing unit for controlling the beam former, an image processor configured to receive the image data from the signal processor and to provide display data, the display configured to receive the display data and to provide the image. By this, the mobile display device comprises the necessary hardware resources to command the ultrasound image acquisition station. Further, the received image data can be processed by a central processing unit and resources of the mobile display device and rendered to display display data on the display of the mobile display device.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In a further embodiment, the mobile display device further comprises a second input device. By this, a user may still turn to the input device of the mobile display device in order to command the ultrasound imaging system. A second input device may for example be a touch screen of the mobile display device, or buttons provided on the mobile display device.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In a further embodiment, the ultrasound imaging system is configured such that the mobile display device is operated by the second operating system when the mobile display device is disconnected from the ultrasound image acquisition station. By this, a user may readily turn the mobile display device back into the general purpose state by disconnecting the mobile display device from the interface assembly of the ultrasound image acquisition station. Further to such automatic switching procedure, the user may be provided with an option to switch between the first and second operating systems during connection of the mobile display device to the ultrasound image acquisition station. For example, such an option may be provided by touching a certain button of the first or second input device or selecting a certain program in the respective operating system architecture.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In a further embodiment, the mobile display device further comprises a signature unit to identify the mobile display device to the ultrasound image acquisition station and to enable bypassing the second operating system and operating the mobile display device by the first operating system. By this, only valid mobile display devices may be connected to the ultrasound acquisition station. This may ensure that only such mobile display devices are connected to the ultrasound image acquisition station that have sufficient hardware resources to run the first operating system. Further, this may ensure that only certain devices of a specific manufacturer, a specific clinic or selected personal may be connected to a certain ultrasound image acquisition station.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In a further embodiment, the mobile display device is a tablet type personal computer or a clamshell type personal computer. By this, commonly known types of personal computers and mobile display devices may be connected to the ultrasound image acquisition station to form the ultrasound imaging system.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In a further embodiment, the ultrasound imaging system is further configured such that at least a portion of the first operating system is copied to the second memory unit of the mobile display device, in particular under control of the first operating system of the image acquisition assembly. By this, the interface link between the image acquisition assembly and the mobile display device may then have a lower transfer rate than would normally be required for the frequent access by the first operating system to its source memory in the first memory unit. Hence, more bandwidth is available, for example for the transfer of ultrasound image data or ultrasound display data.</p>

In particular, the mobile display device <b>18</b> may be a cell phone, a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant), a clamshell type personal computer or a tablet type personal computer.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The mobile display device <b>18</b> may be connected and disconnected to the docking unit <b>16</b> by the user of the ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b>. When disconnected from the docking unit <b>16</b>, the mobile display device <b>18</b> may be run with its own operating system providing all kinds of general purpose applications or medical applications to the user. Further, upon docking the mobile display device <b>18</b> to the docking unit <b>16</b>, the operating system of the mobile display device <b>18</b> is bypassed and an operating system of the ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b> stored in the docking unit <b>16</b> is automatically booted from a hibernated state. This alternative operating system immediately takes over control of the mobile display device <b>18</b> and provides the user with a fully functioning ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b> using the hardware resources of the mobile display device <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In a further embodiment, it is also possible that the probe head <b>14</b> and the docking unit <b>16</b> form a single entity, i.e. are contained within the same housing. Hence, the probe head <b>14</b> and the docking unit may form a single package in a probe housing.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> shows a schematic block diagram as an example for the various components of the ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b> and their location and interaction within the whole ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">As already explained above, the ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b> is used for scanning an area or volume <b>30</b> of a patient <b>12</b>. The area or volume is schematically shown in dashed lines and designated with reference numeral <b>30</b>. The area or volume <b>30</b> is examined via the probe head <b>14</b> carrying a transducer array <b>32</b>. The transducer array <b>32</b> may be of any known type. Hence, the transducer array <b>32</b> may be a one-dimensional transducer array or a two-dimensional transducer array that may be mechanically or electronically scanned. The transducer array <b>32</b> converts the ultrasound signals into electronic signals and vice versa.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">To command the transducer array <b>32</b>, a beam former <b>34</b> is present that is used to control the electronic and/or mechanical scanning of the transducer array and, if possible, the number, density and position of scan lines along which the area or volume <b>30</b> is scanned. Further, a signal processor may be provided that receives the ultrasound receive signal of the beam former and provides an image signal. The beam former <b>34</b> and the signal processor <b>36</b> together may form an image acquisition hardware <b>37</b>. Further, there is provided a first memory unit <b>38</b> having stored thereon a first operating system that operates all hardware of the ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b> in ultrasound imaging applications only.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The mobile display device <b>18</b> comprises a central processing unit <b>40</b> for controlling the beam former <b>34</b>, an image processor <b>42</b> and/or the signal processor <b>36</b>. In any embodiment, the beam former <b>34</b>, the signal processor <b>36</b> and the image processor <b>42</b> may also be of a software-implemented type being part of the first operating system <b>38</b> and run on the central processing unit <b>40</b>. In case one of the group of the signal processor <b>36</b>, the beam former <b>34</b> and the image processor <b>42</b> is of a hardware-implemented type, the location of the respective circuitry is preferably as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. However, it might also be the case that hardware circuitry shown as part of the docking unit <b>16</b> may be present on the mobile display device <b>18</b>, or hardware components as present on the mobile display device <b>18</b> may be part of the docking unit <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The image processor <b>42</b> receives image data from the signal processor <b>36</b> and provides display data to the display <b>26</b>. The beam former <b>34</b>, the signal processor <b>36</b> and the image processor <b>42</b> may be run by the central processing unit <b>40</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Further, the mobile display device <b>18</b> carries a second memory unit <b>44</b> having stored thereon a second operating system to run the mobile display device in a general purpose state. By this, if disconnected from the docking unit <b>16</b>, the mobile display device <b>18</b> can be used by a user for any application. Connected to docking unit <b>16</b>, the first operating system stored on the first memory unit <b>38</b> takes over control of the central processing unit <b>40</b> and/or hardware resources of the ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The first memory unit <b>38</b> and the second memory unit <b>44</b> may comprise at least one hard disk, for example a solid state drive (SSD), and may further comprise at least one random access memory (RAM) device.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In any case, the probe head <b>14</b> and the docking unit <b>16</b> together form an ultrasound image acquisition station <b>46</b>. This ultrasound image acquisition station <b>46</b> is capable of being connected to a console portion <b>48</b> of the ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b> in which console portion <b>48</b> is formed by the mobile display device <b>18</b>. In a further embodiment, the ultrasound image acquisition station <b>46</b> may be formed in a single housing. Hence, the transducer array <b>32</b>, the beam former <b>34</b> and the signal processor <b>36</b> may all be located in the same housing as the probe head <b>14</b>. Further, the first memory unit <b>38</b> can also be located within that housing.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">To enable the connection of the mobile display device <b>18</b> to the ultrasound image acquisition station <b>46</b>, there is provided an interface assembly <b>50</b>, preferably in the form of a plug and socket connection. An interface assembly <b>50</b> forms part of the ultrasound image acquisition station <b>46</b> to receive a mobile display device <b>18</b> for docking To ensure that only proper mobile display devices <b>18</b> are connected to the ultrasound image acquisition station <b>46</b>, the mobile display device <b>18</b> may comprise a signature unit <b>52</b> for identifying a valid mobile display device <b>18</b> to the ultrasound image acquisition station <b>46</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">To properly connect a mobile display device <b>18</b> to the docking unit <b>16</b>, an adapter unit <b>54</b> may be provided that may serve as a frame and/or guidance to insert and hold the mobile display device <b>18</b> within docking unit <b>16</b>. Further, via the adapter unit <b>54</b>, a flush arrangement of the mobile display device <b>18</b> within the docking unit <b>16</b> may be provided to facilitate operation of the ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> shows a sketch of a possible practical embodiment of the ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b> and its components. The docking unit <b>16</b> has a schematically depicted plug and socket connection <b>56</b> to provide the data connection to the mobile display device <b>18</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the mobile display device is a tablet type personal computer. The probe head <b>14</b> is attached via cable <b>58</b> to the docking unit <b>16</b>. However, even two or more probe heads <b>14</b> may be attached to the docking unit <b>16</b>. The docking unit <b>16</b> has an L-shaped cross section with a relatively long feature comprising the docking unit <b>54</b> and the first input device <b>20</b> and a short feature which comprises the interface for connecting the probe head <b>14</b>. Both features are connected via a hinge, so that the docking unit <b>16</b> may be put into a convenient position.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The docking unit <b>16</b> is a compact portable low cost secure and versatile module that may convert any mobile tablet PC into a feature rich ultrasound scanner in particular aimed at the lower end market segment. It consists of an ergonomic frame and the mobile display device <b>18</b> may snap-lock into the plug and socket connection <b>56</b>. The docking unit may contain an optionally battery part image acquisition hardware <b>37</b>. The operating system stored on the mobile display device may for example be a Windows operating system, an Android operating system or an iPhone iOS operating system.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The probe head <b>14</b> may comprise a transducer array <b>32</b> of any known type, for example it may be a linear, curved linear array (CLA), sector or endo-cavity type transducer array. The ultrasound image acquisition station <b>46</b> may contain an auxiliary battery that may supplement a battery present in the mobile display device. By this, the ultrasound imaging system may be allowed for scanning over a time period of several hours. Further, a power receptacle may be present that may provide a DC input from an AC wall adapter to allow the system to scan without time limit.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Further, the docking unit may provide a video output and port expansion such as WiFi and LAN. It may contain a <b>100</b> and more Gigabyte solid state drive (SSD) hard disk as the first memory unit having stored the operating system of the ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b> stored thereon. Further, the first memory unit <b>38</b> may provide image data storage capacity. The mobile display device itself may provide for example WiFi and Bluetooth connections. The docking unit <b>16</b> may be designed to be portable, weighing less than <b>2</b> kg. While scanning a body of a patient, the docking unit <b>16</b> may be laid on a relatively flat surface or mounted on a stand or on the wall.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The mobile display device may for example be run by Dual Core Atom Processor commercially available from the Intel company, Santa Clara, USA. However, any other central processing unit may be present. If not connected to the docking unit, the mobile display device may be an open system to suit any users' needs, for example web browsing, e-mail, other medical applications, video, personal instant messaging, work processing, etc. A user may be free to install additional software and upgrade the mobile display device. In particular, the mobile display device may meet the typical specifications of the standard Medical Clinical Assistant architecture. Such an architecture may be present to provide tablet PC infrastructure for the use of medical personnel at clinics.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">When the mobile display device <b>18</b> is docked to the docking unit <b>16</b>, however, the ultrasound image acquisition station <b>46</b> takes over all of the mobile display devices, hardware resources and bypasses the second operating system <b>44</b> within the mobile display device. This is accomplished by booting again from the first memory unit <b>38</b> in the ultrasound image acquisition station <b>46</b>. An option may be provided to copy images stored on the first memory unit <b>38</b> to the mobile display device's second memory unit <b>44</b> for review when the mobile display device <b>18</b> is disconnected from the docking unit <b>16</b>. Without the mobile display device, the docking unit <b>16</b> may not boot from its internal memory unit <b>38</b> and will not power the probe head <b>14</b>. Such a mechanism may ensure that only skilled personnel may operate the ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Further, the ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b> may be configured such that upon connection of the mobile display device <b>18</b> to the docking unit <b>16</b> the first operating system is booted from the first memory unit <b>38</b> in the docking unit <b>16</b>, the second operating system in the mobile display device <b>18</b> is bypassed, and at least a portion of the first operating system is copied to a volatile memory, for example a RAM device of the second memory unit <b>44</b>, of the mobile display device <b>18</b> under control of the first operating system of the image acquisition assembly <b>46</b>. By this, an ultrasound imaging program can be executed more efficiently, without requiring frequent access to the first memory unit <b>38</b> of the image acquisition assembly <b>46</b> over the interface assembly <b>50</b> between the image acquisition assembly <b>46</b> and the mobile display device <b>18</b>. Copying a portion of the first operating system of the ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b> to a volatile memory or RAM device of the second memory unit <b>44</b> of the mobile display device <b>18</b> has no effect on the un-docked operation of the mobile display device <b>18</b>. The advantage of doing so is that the interface link between the image acquisition assembly <b>46</b> and the mobile display device <b>18</b> may then have a lower transfer rate, e.g. in Mbits/sec, than would normally be required for the frequent access by the first operating system to its source memory in the first memory unit <b>38</b>. This may be particularly useful if an USB 2.0 standard is used for the interface assembly <b>50</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">However, if for example USB 3.0 is used as a standard for the interface assembly <b>50</b>, this would offers about ten times the transfer rate of USB 2.0. Hence using USB 3.0 could obviate the copying of at least a portion of the first operating system into the second memory unit <b>44</b>, in particular the RAM, of the mobile display device <b>18</b>, and allow the mobile display device <b>18</b> to access the first memory unit <b>32</b> in the ultrasound image acquisition station <b>46</b> continuously.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">As commercially available mobile display devices <b>18</b> change over the time, the adapter unit <b>54</b> is provided at the docking unit <b>16</b>. The adapter unit <b>54</b> may be exchanged within the docking unit. The adapter unit <b>54</b> is designed to conform to the outside plastics of the mobile display device. The adapter may not be removable by the user but only by skilled personnel. The adapter unit may also contain the corresponding plug and socket connection <b>56</b>. Such a connection may join power, USB, PCIe, LAN and video signals to the docking unit, so all components of the mobile display device <b>18</b> and the ultrasound image acquisition station <b>46</b> may be exchanged via the interface assembly <b>50</b> provided by the plug and socket connection. Further external connectors may be provided on the docking unit <b>16</b>, for example a power jack, LAN, video and USB.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">In general, the mobile display device <b>18</b> may remain locked to the docking unit <b>16</b> over a larger time period to provide for a stationary ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">As shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the mobile display device <b>18</b> must not necessarily be a tablet personal computer but could alternatively be in the form of a clamshell type personal computer. It may also be a kind of a cell phone, smart phone or personal digital assistant.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">In general, the contemplated embodiments provide for a compact design with small dimensions and a low weight. The ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b> is portable and may be hand-carried but also laid on a surface while operating. It may also be permanently mounted to a rolling stand. The mobile display device <b>18</b> may serve as a user's own personal device or, when connected to the ultrasound image acquisition station <b>46</b>, as a dedicated ultrasound scanner. The operating system may be set in a way that the ultrasound software application and data are entirely separate from the user's software and data. The mobile display device <b>18</b> may be locked to the docking unit <b>16</b> for physical security. Alternatively, the mobile display device <b>18</b> can be removed and secured separately to protect its replacement value or its data. Via the signature unit <b>52</b>, the ultrasound image acquisition station <b>46</b> may only operate when connected to a valid mobile display device <b>18</b>. Further, the ultrasound imaging system <b>10</b> may be provided at low cost since the mobile display device <b>18</b> may be one of commercially available mobile display devices produced in high numbers.</p>
