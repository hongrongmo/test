      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This invention relates generally to rubber compositions and more particularly, to rubber compositions having low resin cross-linking, methods for making them and articles made from such rubber compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Tires and other articles that are made of rubber are manufactured from rubber compositions that include rubber, e.g., natural rubber, synthetic rubber or combinations thereof, as well as fillers, plasticizers, vulcanizing agents and other chemicals that improve the physical characteristics of the cured rubber composition. One class of materials that may be added to the rubber compositions is resin.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Resins are typically (but not always) nonvolatile, solid organic substances that are produced naturally by plants or synthetically from petrochemicals or other sources of hydrocarbon materials. As used in rubber compositions, resins may be classified as either reinforcing resins or as plasticizing resins. Plasticizing resins are added to a rubber composition to improve the plasticity or workability of a rubber composition. They are often added as a substitute for or in addition to a processing oil and are known to improve the resulting physical characteristics of the cured rubber composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Reinforcing resins are added to a rubber composition to increase the rigidity of the cured rubber composition. These reinforcing resins intermix with the rubber polymer chains and, when reacted with a linking agent or with each other, form a three-dimensional network that improves the physical characteristics of the cured rubber composition. Many of these resins are classified as methylene acceptor/donor systems that react together to generate a three-dimensional reinforcing resin network by a condensation reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In addition to resins, other additives are known to be added to rubber compositions to improve their physical properties, such additives including antioxidants, antiozonants, anti-reversion agents and so forth. Such additives are well known in the rubber industry.</p>

    </summary>
    <detailed-desc>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0013">Particular embodiments of the present invention include methods for producing rubber compositions that have low resin cross-linking where the resin advantageously provides protection against degradation to the cured rubber compositions through the cross-linked resin properties. Such cross-linking resins can provide antidegradant protection, for example, against ozone attack, oxidation, flex fatigue, ageing, high temperature degradation and catalytic degradation by copper or other heavy metals.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0014">Other embodiments include rubber compositions made by such methods as well as rubber articles, including tire components, belts, hoses and so forth made with the rubber compositions and their methods of making. Yet other embodiments include such methods and articles using the same resin cross-linking but without the constraint of having the low level of cross-linking.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0015">More particularly the cross-linking resins that provide improved antidegradation properties contain specific methylene acceptors useful in methylene acceptor/donor systems that may be useful as reinforcing resins in rubber compositions. However, in particular embodiments, instead of providing a normal amount of methylene donor necessary to provide a significant increase in the rigidity of the rubber composition, only a very small amount of the methylene donor is provided. In other embodiments, where an increase in rigidity may be desired, a greater amount of the methylene donor may be added.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0016">As has been noted, for some embodiments it has been surprisingly discovered that when the very small amount of the methylene donor is provided in the rubber composition having the specific methylene acceptor, the linkages formed during the resinification are not so extensive so as to significantly increase the rigidity of the rubber composition but instead the cured rubber demonstrates a significant increase in its degradation resistance, e.g., to ozone attack, fatigue failure and cohesive properties, while at the same time increasing the duration of that protection.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0017">Advantageously the cross-linking between the methylene acceptor and the methylene donor makes the methylene acceptor part of a larger molecule so that its ability to migrate to other parts of the tire and/or away from the tire is significantly decreased and yet during the mixing process, when the methylene acceptor is mixed into the rubber composition, the molecule is still small enough so that good dispersion of the methylene acceptor can be achieved. As known to those skilled in the art, the larger the molecule to be mixed into the rubber composition, the more difficult it is to achieve good dispersion during the mixing process.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0018">As used herein, âdiene elastomerâ and ârubberâ are synonymous terms and may be used interchangeably.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0019">As used herein, a ânon-productiveâ mix includes many of the components of a rubber composition but includes no vulcanization agents and typically no primary accelerators. A âproductiveâ mix results after the vulcanization agents and typically any primary accelerators are added to the non-productive mix. Vulcanization agents as used herein are those materials that cause the cross-linkage of the rubber and therefore are added only to the productive mix so that premature curing does not occur</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0020">As used herein, âbased uponâ is a term recognizing that embodiments of the present invention are made of vulcanized or cured rubber compositions that were, at the time of their assembly, uncured. The cured rubber composition is therefore âbased uponâ the uncured rubber composition. In other words, the cross-linked rubber composition is based upon or comprises the constituents of the cross-linkable rubber composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0021">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, provided by way of explanation of the invention. For example, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield still a third embodiment. It is intended that the present invention include these and other modifications and variations.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0022">The disclosed rubber compositions are useful for many types of articles that are made of rubber including tires, rubber coatings, vibration dampeners, tool grips, tools and so forth. Tires are made of many rubber parts and the disclosed rubber compositions are useful for such tire components as, for example, sidewall components, bead area components, shoulder components, treads, undertreads and/or rubber coatings, such rubber coating useful, for example, for the cords, plies and/or belts of the tire, such components being well known to those in the tire field.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0023">As noted above, one surprising improvement in the rubber composition's anti-degradation properties results from the addition of a very small quantity of methylene donor with a methylene acceptor that may be characterized as having an antidegradant property so that the ability of the methylene acceptor to diffuse through the tire is limited. Methylene acceptors and methylene donors and their use in methylene acceptor/donor systems are well known in the art for their ability to increase the rigidity of a rubber composition. In such systems the methylene donor reacts with the methylene acceptor to generate a three-dimensional reinforcing resin network by a condensation reaction that, when formed in the rubber composition, provides it, inter alia, with increased rigidity.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0024">However, as noted, by adding just a small amount of the methylene donor, the rigidity is not significantly increased but the small amount of linking that occurs causes the molecules to become somewhat larger (but not nearly as large as the typical resin network when larger amounts of methylene donors are added), thereby hindering their ability to migrate through the rubber. Such compositions demonstrate an improvement in their ability to resist degradation and the antidegradation properties will last longer since the antidegradant is somewhat constrained from migration.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0025">An example of a useful methylene acceptor is of the form</p>

Such compounds are well known by those having ordinary skill in the art and their methods for being synthesized are also known.</p>

Other compounds may be considered by those having ordinary skill in the art who realize that a useful antidegradant may be incorporated into a resin network to provide antidegradant properties to a rubber composition while also linking the antidegradant into a resin network to limit is ability to diffuse through the tire. Combinations of any of the useful methylene acceptors may also be used as appropriate for particular embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0037">Suitable methylene donors that will react with the methylene acceptors may be selected, for example, from hexamethylenetetramine (HMT); hexamethoxymethylmelamine (HMMM); formaldehyde; paraformaldehyde; trioxane; 2-methyl-2-nitro-1-propanal; substituted melamine resins such as N-substituted oxymethylmelamine resins; glycoluril compounds such as tetramethoxymethyl glycoluril; urea-formaldehyde resins such as butylated urea-formaldehyde resins; or mixtures thereof.

      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0055">Highly dispersible precipitated silicas (referred to as âHDSâ) may be useful in particular embodiments of such rubber compositions disclosed herein, wherein âhighly dispersible silicaâ is understood to mean any silica having a substantial ability to disagglomerate and to disperse in an elastomeric matrix. Such determinations may be observed in known manner by electron or optical microscopy on thin sections. Examples of known highly dispersible silicas include, for example, Perkasil KS 430 from Akzo, the silica BV3380 from Degussa, the silicas Zeosil 1165 MP and 1115 MP from Rhodia, the silica Hi-Sil 2000 from PPG and the silicas Zeopol 8741 or 8745 from Huber.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0056">When silica is added to the rubber composition, a proportional amount of a silane coupling agent is also added to the rubber composition. The silane coupling agent is a sulfur-containing organosilicon compound that reacts with the silanol groups of the silica during mixing and with the elastomers during vulcanization to provide improved properties of the cured rubber composition. A suitable coupling agent is one that is capable of establishing a sufficient chemical and/or physical bond between the inorganic filler and the diene elastomer; which is at least bifunctional, having, for example, the simplified general formula âY-T-Xâ, in which: Y represents a functional group (âYâ function) which is capable of bonding physically and/or chemically with the inorganic filler, such a bond being able to be established, for example, between a silicon atom of the coupling agent and the surface hydroxyl (OH) groups of the inorganic filler (for example, surface silanols in the case of silica); X represents a functional group (âXâ function) which is capable of bonding physically and/or chemically with the diene elastomer, for example by means of a sulfur atom; T represents a divalent organic group making it possible to link Y and X.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0057">Any of the organosilicon compounds that contain sulfur and are known to one having ordinary skill in the art are useful for practicing embodiments of the present invention. Examples of suitable silane coupling agents having two atoms of silicon in the silane molecule include 3,3â²-bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) disulfide and 3,3â²-bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide (known as Si69). Both of these are available commercially from Degussa as X75-S and X50-S respectively, though not in pure form. Degussa reports the molecular weight of the X50-S to be 532 g/mole and the X75-S to be 486 g/mole. Both of these commercially available products include the active component mixed 50-50 by weight with a N330 carbon black. Other examples of suitable silane coupling agents having two atoms of silicon in the silane molecule include 2,2â²-bis(triethoxysilylethyl) tetrasulfide, 3,3â²-bis(tri-t-butoxy-silylpropyl) disulfide and 3,3â²-bis(di t-butylmethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide. Examples of silane coupling agents having just one silicon atom in the silane molecule include, for example, 3,3â² (triethoxysilylpropyl) disulfide and 3,3â² (triethoxy-silylpropyl) tetrasulfide. The amount of silane coupling agent can vary over a suitable range as known to one having ordinary skill in the art. Typically the amount added is between 7 wt. % and 15 wt. % or alternatively between 8 wt. % and 12 wt. % or between 9 wt. % and 11 wt. % of the total weight of silica added to the rubber composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0058">Particular embodiments of the rubber compositions disclosed herein may include no processing oil or very little, such no more than 5 phr. Processing oils are well known to one having ordinary skill in the art, are generally extracted from petroleum and are classified as being paraffinic, aromatic or naphthenic type processing oil, including MES and TDAE oils. Processing oils are also known to include, inter alia, plant-based oils, such as sunflower oil, rapeseed oil and vegetable oil. Some of the rubber compositions disclosed herein may include an elastomer, such as a styrene-butadiene rubber, that has been extended with one or more such processing oils but such oil is limited in the rubber composition of particular embodiments as being no more than 10 phr of the total elastomer content of the rubber composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0059">The rubber compositions disclosed herein may further include, in addition to the compounds already described, all or part of the components often used in diene rubber compositions intended for the manufacture of tires, such as plasticizers, pigments, protective agents of the type that include antioxidants and/or antiozonants, vulcanization retarders, a vulcanization system based, for example, on sulfur or on a peroxide, vulcanization accelerators, vulcanization activators, extender oils and so forth. There may also be added, if desired, one or more conventional non-reinforcing fillers such as clays, bentonite, talc, chalk or kaolin.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0060">The vulcanization system is preferably, for particular embodiments, one based on sulfur and on an accelerator but other vulcanization agents known to one skilled in the art may be useful as well. The vulcanization agents as used herein are those materials that cause the cross-linkage of the rubber and therefore may be added only to the productive mix so that premature curing does not occur, such agents including, for example, sulfur and peroxides. Use may be made of any compound capable of acting as an accelerator of the vulcanization of elastomers in the presence of sulfur, in particular those chosen from the group consisting of 2-mercaptobenzothiazyl disulfide (abbreviated to âMBTSâ), N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazole-sulphenamide (abbreviated to âCBSâ), N,N-dicyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolesulphenamide (abbreviated to âDCBSâ), N-tert-butyl-2-benzothiazolesulphenamide (abbreviated to âTBBSâ), N-tert-butyl-2-benzothiazole-sulphenimide (abbreviated to âTBSIâ) and the mixtures of these compounds. Preferably, a primary accelerator of the sulfenamide type is used.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0061">The vulcanization system may further include various known secondary accelerators or vulcanization activators, such as zinc oxide, stearic acid and guanidine derivatives (in particular diphenylguanidine).</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0062">The rubber compositions that are embodiments of the present invention may be produced in suitable mixers in a manner known to those having ordinary skill in the art. Typically the mixing may occur using two successive preparation phases, a first phase of thermo-mechanical working at high temperature followed by a second phase of mechanical working at a lower temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0063">The first phase, sometimes referred to as a ânon-productiveâ phase, includes thoroughly mixing, for example by kneading in a Banbury type mixer, the various ingredients of the composition but excluding the vulcanization agent (such as sulfur) and the methylene donor. It is carried out in a suitable kneading device, such as an internal mixer, until under the action of the mechanical working and the high shearing imposed on the mixture, a maximum temperature of generally between 120Â° C. and 190Â° C. is reached.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0064">After cooling the mixture a second phase of mechanical working is implemented at a lower temperature. Sometimes referred to a âproductiveâ phase, this finishing phase typically consists of incorporating the vulcanization system and the methylene donor into the rubber composition using a suitable device, such as an open mill. It is performed for an appropriate time (typically, for example, between 1 and 30 minutes or between 2 and 10 minutes), and at a sufficiently low temperature, i.e., lower than the vulcanization temperature of the mixture and lower than the cross-linking temperature of the methylene donor/acceptor system, so as to protect against premature vulcanization or resinification cross-linking.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0065">The rubber composition can be formed into useful articles, including tire components. Tire treads, for example, may be formed as tread bands and then later made a part of a tire or they be formed directly onto a tire carcass by, for example, extrusion and then cured in a mold. Other components such as those located in the bead area of the tire or in the sidewall may be formed and assembled into a green tire and then cured with the curing of the tire. Likewise, fabric or metal may be coated with the rubber compositions for later incorporation into a tire building process as, for example, tire belts or cords.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0066">The invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which are to be regarded only as illustrations and not delimitative of the invention in any way. The properties of the compositions disclosed in the examples were evaluated as described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0067">Mooney Plasticity (ML 1+4) was measured in accordance with ASTM Standard D1646. In general, the composition in an uncured state is molded in a cylindrical enclosure and heated to 100Â° C. After 1 minute of preheating, the rotor turns within the test sample at 2 rpm, and the torque used for maintaining this movement is measured after 4 minutes of rotation. The Mooney Plasticity is expressed in âMooney unitsâ (MU, with 1 MU=0.83 Newton-meter).</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0068">Moduli of elongation (MPa) were measured at 10% (MA10) and at 100% (MA100) at a temperature of 23Â° C. based on ASTM Standard D412 on dumb bell test pieces. The measurements were taken in the second elongation; i.e., after an accommodation cycle. These measurements are secant moduli in MPa, based on the original cross section of the test piece.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0069">The elongation property was measured as elongation at break (%) and the corresponding elongation stress (MPa), which is measured at 23Â° C. in accordance with ASTM Standard D412 on ASTM C test pieces.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0070">Tear properties were determined from test samples cut from a cured plaque with a thickness of approximately 2.5 mm. Notches (perpendicular to the test direction) were created in the samples prior to testing. The force and elongation at break was measured using an Instron 5565 Uniaxial Testing System. The cross-head speed was 500 mm/min. Samples were tested at ambient and at 60Â° C. and at 100Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0071">Static ozone surface cracking was evaluated using a test closely related to the ASTM 1149-99 Standard Test Method for rubber deterioration titled Surface Ozone Cracking in a Chamber. The testing utilized in the examples that follow differs in the construction of the sample holder, which was a rod rather than a wooden block holder as required under the ASTM test method. Rectangular samples were cut with a die then folded in half and stapled such that the curvature of the loop has a maximum local strain of 18%.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0072">These samples were hung on a rod for 2-5 days under ambient conditions before being placed in an ozone chamber. The ozone chamber conditions were set at 50 parts per hundred million ozone (pphm) and a temperature of 40Â° C. for one week. The samples were periodically evaluated for cracks. The samples were evaluated using the Rubber Deterioration Test Grades that consists of three numbers. The first number indicates the number of cracks in the sample, the second rates the width of the cracks and the third number is the depth of the crack. Zero indicates that no cracks were observed. The ozone cracking index is the product of the three numbers determined by the Rubber Deterioration Test Grades.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0073">Cyclic fatigue testing was conducted on the cured test samples that were dumbbell shaped and 65 mm long. The test was conducted at ambient temperature by imposing cyclic strain from between 0% and 60% on the test pieces. The total number of cycles to failure was recorded for each test sample as the measurement of cyclic fatigue.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0074">This example illustrates the surprising increase in the resistance to ozone attack and fatigue failure by the rubber compositions in accordance with the present invention. The formulations were prepared with the component amounts shown in Table 1. The 4-HDPA was obtained from NeoSources International with offices in Texas. It should be noted that no anti-degradation chemicals were added to the rubber compositions that would mask the results achieved from the 4-HDPA.</p>
