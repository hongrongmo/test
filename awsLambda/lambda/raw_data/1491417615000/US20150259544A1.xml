      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This description generally relates to compositions and coatings for surfaces such as floors, walls, furniture and any equipment requiring surface protection.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Various types of protective polymer coatings have been used to protect surfaces from dirt and wear whilst providing additional functions, such as slip resistance, gloss, and color, on a variety of surfaces such flooring, walls, furniture or specialized equipment, for example. For example, floor surfaces made of materials such as vinyl, linoleum, wood, concrete, marble, terrazzo, ceramic, and the like, have been based on permanent polymeric finish coatings. Such coatings, however, require maintenance through the use of cleaners and tools such as buffing or burnishing machines operated by trained technicians. Coatings typically become worn over time, either from frictional wear or exposure to weather elements. When it becomes necessary to entirely remove the floor finish, chemical strippers are required to dissolve the coating for removal. Use of chemical strippers is typically accompanied by undesirable odors. Other types of semi-permanent coatings utilizing epoxy, or silane technologies have been developed, and likewise, these coating systems often require sanding, mechanical abrasion for removal. In addition to the problem of removal, polymeric floor coatings can be slippery when wet.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Polyurethane is conventionally used for coatings because of its hardness, which gives it the ability to protect the coated surface from abrasion. Due to its stiffness and low adhesion strength to surfaces, polyurethane coatings suffer from becoming flaky with age and often acquiring a worn out look from acquired scratches. Conventionally, the stiffness of polyurethanes may be reduced by incorporating plasticizers into the coating to give the coating greater stress tolerance during use and hence less tendency to crack and flake. However, plasticizers can migrate out of the coating, vaporizing to produce chemical odors, which can be undesirable in enclosed spaces. Furthermore, polyurethanes generally exhibit relatively low peel strength i.e., having poor adhesion to surfaces, compared to adhesives such as epoxies due to polyurethane's low adhesion strength to surfaces, it tends to delaminate. As a result, polyurethane coatings typically show easy film breakage and detachment from a coated surface when attempts are made to remove it from the surface. Surface primers have been used to improve adhesion to the surface. However, primer application steps create further downtime, and furthermore, solvents used in primers may induce cracking in polyurethanes. In some instances, a high-strength compatible adhesive layer is used to improve adhesion of the coating to the surface, but resulting in increased costs and downtime.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">There is therefore a need for an improved coating that overcomes the aforementioned shortcomings.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Various aspects of the invention as described herein provide for coatings that are flexible and peelable. Polyurethane-based coatings have been presently developed to overcome its shortcomings of poor adhesion and stiffness. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors have found that by blending polyurethane with another polymer having in comparison to polyurethane properties of higher peel strength and higher percent elongation at break when cured an excellent peelable, flexible coating material that is adhesive yet peelable, and sufficiently flexible without cracking or flaking can be achieved, hence facilitating ease of removal. These coatings provide a means to protect surfaces from conventional wear and tear caused by direct contact, while advantageously enabling users to remove the coatings easily and inexpensively once the coatings are worn out, without the need for conventional chemical strippers or mechanical grinders or sanders. Furthermore, in various embodiments, the coating is a binder for particulate materials that serve various functions, such as slip-resistance under wet/damp conditions while maintaining its high gloss properties. Auxiliary properties such as anti-microbial properties, desiccating properties, etc. can also be achieved through the addition of suitable particulate materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The present specification is not limited to the specific examples or data set forth herein. The compositions, coatings and methods disclosed herein are capable of being made, practiced, used, carried out and/or formed in various ways expected of a skilled person in the field once an understanding of the invention is acquired.

Use of the word âaboutâ to describe a particular recited amount or range of amounts is meant to indicate that values very near to the recited amount are included in that amount, such as values that could or naturally would be accounted for due to manufacturing tolerances, instrument and human error in forming measurements, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Unless otherwise stated, reference to any document herein does not constitute an admission that any of these documents forms part of the common general knowledge in the art. Any discussion of the references states what their authors assert, and the applicant reserves the right to challenge the accuracy and pertinency of any of the documents cited herein. All references cited herein are fully incorporated by reference, unless explicitly indicated otherwise.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a peelable flexible coating that comprises a polymer blend comprising polyurethane as a major component, and a polymer P<b>2</b> having in comparison to polyurethane a higher peel strength to the surface to be coated as well as higher percent elongation at break when cured.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In this context, the term âblendâ refers to any form of polymer blend, including immiscible polymer blends (or heterogeneous polymer blends) having two glass transition temperatures, compatible polymer blends exhibiting macroscopically uniform physical properties due to sufficiently strong interactions between the component polymers, and miscible polymer blends (homogeneous polymer blend) observing a single-phase structure with one glass transition temperature. The term âpeelableâ refers to the property of being removable by peeling. Peel strength is a measure of adhesive bond strength, and can defined by various measurements, such as the average load required to part two bonded materials per 25 mm separation, or the average load per unit width of bond line required to part two bonded materials where the angle of separation is 180 degrees and separation rate is 6 inches per minute (ASTM D-903). Percent elongation at break of a material refers to its strain at fracture, expressed as a percentage of its initial length. It is a measure of a material's flexibility in terms of how it will deform and strain when weight or force is applied, and may be expressed in terms of percent elongation at break as referenced throughout this application. By definition, flexible materials have a high percent elongation at break, and stiffer materials have a low percent elongation at break. In other words therefore, P<b>2</b> is selected from a polymer that exhibits greater flexibility and higher adhesive bond strength to the surface to be coated than polyurethane.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In order to achieve a peelable coating, polymer P<b>2</b> is selected from a polymer having a higher peel strength to the surface to be coated relative to polyurethane. In exemplary embodiments, polymer P<b>2</b> has a peel strength of more than 5 N/25 mm, or more preferably more than 10 N/25 mm, or in some examples more than 20 N/25 mm or 25 N/25 mm, so that when blended with polyurethane, the coating achieves a peel strength greater than polyurethane alone, of between about 1 N/25 mm to 20 N/25 mm, or in some cases between 1 to 10 N/25 mm. In some embodiments where the peel strength of the coating to the surface is sufficiently low, the act of peeling the coating can be carried out by hand manually. In other embodiments where the adhesion bond strength of the coating to the surface is high, peeling may be carried out with the aid of tools, or by incorporating peel tabs at various parts of the coating. In an exemplary embodiment, the peel strength (ASTM D1000) of the coating to the surface is about 10 N/25 mm or preferably about 5 N/25 mm. Referring to various technical literature, various 3M Scotch Weld polyurethane reactive adhesives or structural adhesives exhibit peel strengths commonly above 250-300 N/25 mm by comparison.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In order to achieve a flexible coating, polymer P<b>2</b> has, in addition to the properties of higher peel strength, a higher percent elongation at break in comparison to polyurethane. Depending on the specific formulation, various polyurethane coatings may show elongation at break values of less than 25%, or less than 50%, or less than 100%. Hence, the elongation at break characteristic of polymer P<b>2</b> is not fixed, but relative to the polyurethane present. In exemplary embodiments, polymer P<b>2</b> has a percent elongation at break of more than 200%, or more preferably more than 500% elongation at break.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In some embodiments, P<b>2</b> is selected from polyesters, polyurethane-acrylates (PUA), polyacrylates, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, acrylate modified polyolefins, and a combination thereof. Polymer P<b>2</b> may also be selected from soft or elastomeric thermoplastic polyurethanes having soft segment domains having polyol/polyether/polyester linkages, blended with the major component of polyurethane with hard segment domains having urethane linkages. Generally, polymer P<b>2</b> may be selected from polymers compatible with polyurethane, i.e., capable of homogeneous blending with polyurethane. Polyurethane and polymer P<b>2</b> may both comprise a water dispersible polymer. Optionally, the film formation characteristics of polymer P<b>2</b> may be considered. In other embodiments, P<b>2</b> comprises a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) polymer. Examples of suitable PSA polymers include PSAs that contain elastomers such as acrylics, ethylene vinyl acetate, vinyl ethers and styrene block copolymers.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">By blending polyurethane with polymer P<b>2</b> having the aforementioned properties, coatings formed becomes both peelable and flexible. In this manner, the coating may be formed as a single layer adhering directly to the surface to be coated, as no surface primer or intermediate adhesive layer or tackifier is required. The single layer coating may be formed through the application of one coat, or through the application of multiple coats. One coat may be suitable for forming a thin layer, whereas multiple coats of 2, 3, 4, or more coats successively may be suitable for forming a thick layer. In this regard, the coating thickness may range from a thin layer of 100 microns, or 10 microns, or less, to a thick layer of 1000 microns, or 10000 microns, or more. In some embodiments for floor coatings, the typical thickness of a coating ranges from 100 microns to 200 microns.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In one embodiment, the coating is formed from a plasticizer-free coating formulation. By being plasticizer-free, it is meant that the coating is at least substantially, or totally, free of conventional plasticizers used to increase the plasticity or fluidity of the coating composition. In the case of polyurethanes, phthalate-based plasticizers such as di-isooctyl phthalate (DIOP) or other phthalate esters have been commonly used plasticizers. The absence of such compounds renders the coating composition plasticizer free. Phthalate-free formulations are desirable because of the documented harmful effects of phthalates on the human body. The presence of minute or trace quantities of such plasticizers, such as a content of less than 0.1% by weight, or more preferably less than 0.01% by weight, may inadvertently be present and may be considered essentially plasticizer free.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In some embodiments, the coating further comprises a third polymer P<b>3</b> having higher peel strength to the surface to be coated and/or higher percent elongation at break than polymer P<b>2</b> when cured. Polymer P<b>3</b> is provided as an adhesion and modulus modifier to complement P<b>2</b>, compensating for weaker properties in P<b>2</b>. The addition of a third polymer P<b>3</b> may be used to achieve coating properties that are unachievable through the combination of polyurethane and polymer P<b>2</b> alone. P<b>3</b> may be selected from a polymer that on its own forms a very soft &amp; flexible film when cured.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In some embodiments, the coating may comprise three different polymers, namely, polyurethane, a second polymer P<b>2</b> and a third polymer P<b>3</b>. In one example, polymer P<b>2</b> has higher peel strength than polyurethane but percent elongation at break that is similar or marginally higher than polyurethane, and polymer P<b>3</b> has higher percent elongation at break than P<b>2</b>, hence compensating for the low flexibility of P<b>2</b>. In another example, polymer P<b>2</b> has higher percent elongation at break than polyurethane but similar or marginally better adhesion to a specified substrate, and a third polymer P<b>3</b> which provides better adhesion to the substrate than P<b>2</b>, hence compensating for the low peel strength of P<b>2</b>. Hence, polymer P<b>3</b> may be selected to compensate for poor peel strength and/or poor flexibility of polymer P<b>2</b>. Depending on the properties of P<b>2</b> that require compensating, P<b>3</b> may be selected from polymers that exhibit greater than 700%, or 1000% elongation at break, and high peel strength of greater than 25 N/25 mm, or greater than 30 N/25 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">P<b>3</b> may also be selected from polymers having other properties such as chemical resistance and thermal resistance or to modify the minimum film formation temperature (MFFT) the glass transition temperature of the polymer blend. In one embodiment, P<b>3</b> comprises a polymer having MFFT of about 0Â° C. or less, and a glass transition temperature substantially similar to the minimum film formation temperature. This enables film formation at room temperature. In one example, P<b>3</b> comprises a polymer having a combination of MFFT of less than 0Â° C. and 1000% elongation at break to facilitate film formation without co-solvent added and to impart flexible properties to the cured coating.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In embodiments of coatings comprising polyurethane and polymer P<b>2</b>, the following illustrative compositional ranges may be used: the coating may comprise 60% to 90% by weight of polyurethane and 10% to 40% by weight of polymer P<b>2</b> (dry solid content). In an exemplary embodiment, polymer P<b>2</b> comprises polyacrylate present in an amount such that the weight ratio of polyurethane to polyacrylate in the coating is between 1 to 10. In another exemplary embodiment, polymer P<b>2</b> comprises polyurethane with soft segment domains having polyol/polyether/polyester linkages, blended with polyurethane with hard segment domains having urethane linkages. In accordance with the foregoing, the coating may comprise any of the following compositional combinations: (i) 60% polyurethane+40% polyurethane-acrylates, (ii) 70% polyurethane+30% polyacrylates, (iii) 80% polyurethane+20% polyurethane, (iv) 90% polyurethane+10% polyvinylalcohol. Other possible combinations include the following: (i) 70% polyurethane comprising hard segment domains having urethane linkages covalently coupled to 30% polyurethane comprising soft segment domains having polyol/polyether/polyester linkages, (ii) 70% polyurethane+30% polyacrylate, (iii) 70% polyurethane+30% polyurethane-acrylate, (iv) 60% polyurethane+20% polyurethane+20% polyurethane-acrylate, (v) 70% polyurethane+30% polyvinyl acetate.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">In embodiments comprising polyurethane, polymer P<b>2</b> and polymer P<b>3</b>, the coating may comprise 60% to 90% by weight of polyurethane, 5% to 30% by weight of polymer P<b>2</b>, and 5% to 30% by weight of polymer P<b>3</b>. For example, the coating may comprise any of the following compositions: (i) 60% polyurethane+30% polyurethane-acrylates+10% polyvinylacetate; (ii) 70% polyurethane+20% polyacrylates+polyesters.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In a preferred embodiment, the coating further comprises particles distributed or dispersed in the polymer blend. The polymer blends of polyurethane and polymer P<b>2</b>, and optionally polymer P<b>3</b>, as described above provide a convenient peelable, flexible matrix for holding various types of particulate materials that serves various functions. Examples of contemplated particulate materials include desiccants, fire retardants, antifouling materials, disinfectants, ultraviolet absorbing materials, heat absorbing materials, photocatalysts, aromatic compounds, insecticides, color pigments, reflective materials and high refractive index materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In one embodiment, the particulate materials comprise slip resistant granules (or particles). The addition of slip resistant granules gives rise to slip resistant floor coatings that provide increased traction &amp; slip resistance that the polymeric coating alone may not be able to achieve. Slip resistant granules may comprise an organic selected from the group consisting of polyolefin, polyacrylate, polyester, nylon, polycarbonate, polyoxymethylene, fluoropolymer, styrene, and polyurethane. Slip resistant granules may comprise thermoplastic polyolefins such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polymethylpentene (PMP), polybutene-1 (PB-1); as well as polyolefin elastomers such as polyisobutylene (PIB), Ethylene propylene rubber (EPR), ethylene propylene diene monomer (M-class) rubber (EPDM rubber).</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In a preferred embodiment, slip resistant granules comprise Polypropylene (PP) granules. PP granules can be purchased inexpensively. They were found to provide good compositional stability due to its density and non-polar nature. When cured, polypropylene granules were found to provide high slip resistance, as well as similar refractive index to the polyurethane of about 1.4 to 1.5, which can help maintain the high gloss on the coating surface. Its low density of 0.8 g/cc at 25Â° C., can improve the storage stability of the final coating product without precipitation. Also, the blocky shape of polypropylene granules helps to prevent injury in the event of fall/slip accident. In exemplary embodiments, the coating may be formed using a coating composition comprising between 1% to 10% by weight of polypropylene granules, or preferably between 1% to 5% by weight of polypropylene granules.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Slip resistant granules may also comprise inorganic materials selected from the group consisting of calcium carbonate, talc, barytes, clays, silicas, titanium dioxide, carbon black, organo-clay, alumina, and carbon nanotubes, glass bubbles, silicon carbide, quartz, cerium oxide, silica, ceramic particles, and ground minerals. Other types of materials such as ionomers, rubber particles, core-shell particles, or engineering plastic polymers with high temperature resistance such as polyether ether ketone (PEEK) and polyethersulfone (PES) may be used to achieve slip resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The slip resistant granules may have a size of between 10 to 1000 microns, or in exemplary embodiments, between 30 to 400 microns. A combination of large particles and small particles, as illustrated in the figures, may also be used. In some embodiments, the particles are selected to be of a size that is less than the thickness of the coating to be applied. Where high slip resistance is required, large particles that exceed coating thickness may be selected in order for the particles to protrude from the coating, thereby providing greater surface contact for increasing contact friction. Beyond a certain size threshold, the particles may cause the coating to lose its glossy appearance due to the lower light scattering ability of the larger particles. Hence, an optimal range exists where an acceptable balance between slip resistance and glossiness may be achieved, if glossiness is a consideration. In one embodiment, this optimal range occurs with formulations that comprises particles with a size of between about 60 to 200 microns. Such a formulation can exhibit slip resistance of at least 20 BNP, or at least 25 or more preferably at least 30 BNP, as tested by the British Pendulum Slip Resistance Tester under wet conditions, and gloss of at least 20 GU, or at least 30 GU, or at least 40 GU, or more preferably at least 50 GU at 60Â° as measured by a standard glossmeter (ISO 2813).</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In some cases, pre-existing finish coatings on the surface to be coated may interfere with the adhesion between the peelable coating and the surface. Specifically, peelability issues may arise due to the different adhesion levels between the coating and the surface, leading to excessively high or low levels of adhesion between the coating and the surface. For example, floor substrates may have been coated with various floor finish coating products comprising polymeric materials such as acrylic polymers or polyurethane coating resins for floor protection. These various floor finish coatings can increase or decrease the peel strength of the peelable coating to be applied, hence affecting the peelable performance of the coating to be applied. In order to keep the peelable performance consistent regardless of pre-existing floor finish present, a primer coating layer may be added as an intermediate layer between the peelable coating to be applied and the pre-existing floor finish, i.e., in this embodiment, the coating further comprises a primer layer arranged between the coating and the surface. The primer layer provides a predictable interface for the peelable coating, so that consistent peelability or peel strength is achieved regardless of the floor finish coating present. Hence, in this context, the term âprimerâ as referenced in the term âprimer coating layerâ, herein also used interchangeably with the term âprimer layerâ, denotes a material that primes the surface to be coated by modifying, either by increasing or decreasing, the adhesion of the coating to the surface to a level that is suitable for the desired peelable performance.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In one embodiment, the primer layer comprises a release coating for decreasing the adhesion of the coating to the surface. The release coating may comprise surface active agents, such as polymers that have low surface energy, as exemplified by acrylic polymers and polyurethane polymers that are silicone or fluorine modified, or fluoropolymers which are synthesized from fluorinated monomers that have a certain degree of substitution of carbon chain hydrogen by fluorine. Polymer coatings that exhibit relatively low surface energy, such as paraffin, polypropylene, polyethylene and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), may also be suitable as release coatings. Certain commercially available floor finishes may also be suitable for use as release coatings, such as 3M Scotchgardâ¢ Vinyl Floor Protector, and other floor finishes exhibiting low surface energy, such as silane or fluoro containing compounds and polymers. In preferred embodiments, the primer comprises at least one of a fluorinated compound, fluoropolymer or fluorine modified polymer, an acrylic polymer, a polyurethane, a polyurethane acrylate, a silicone compound, a silicone modified polymer, paraffin wax, polypropylene wax, polyethylene wax, and mixtures thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The adhesion peel strength of the peelable coating to the floor surface may also be tuned to a desired range by incorporating surface active materials, particularly low surface energy additives, directly into the coating, without using a primer layer, or optionally, in combination with a primer layer as described in the foregoing paragraphs. For example, low surface energy polymers similar to those used for the primer layer may be added as an adhesion modifying additive to the peelable coating, or alternatively to the floor finish. Other examples of suitable low surface energy materials include polymeric fluorochemical surfactants such as 3M Novecâ¢ fluorosurfactants, silicone polyethers available from Dow Corning Inc., low tack adhesives such as styrene/acrylic acid copolymer microspheres, and hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO).</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In another embodiment, the primer layer comprises an adhesion promoter for increasing the adhesion of the coating to the floor surface. This may be useful in cases where the surface to be coated contains low surface energy materials, such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), or have resins/oil/wax from the floor timber accumulating on the surface over time, for example. In other examples, the primer layer is an interface or intermediate layer serving other functions than adhesion modification, such as a primer layer functioning as a protective layer (e.g., a polycarbonate primer layer), or as a backing to enable the peelable layer to be cohesively detached from a substrate surface, or a coloring layer, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Base additives may be present in the coatings to achieve the necessary physical or chemical properties required in a specific application. As described below, base additives may be added to the liquid coating composition before application to the surface to be coated. The additives may comprise volatile compounds that vaporize away during the curing of the coating, or it may comprise non-volatile compounds that stay in the coating after curing. Where polymer P<b>2</b> is selected to form a partially immiscible blend with polyurethane, polar or partially polar organic co-solvents may be added to enable miscibility between the polymers present. Rheology modifiers may be added to control the viscosity of the composition. For example, a specific application may require the composition to be sufficiently viscous to appropriately suspend slip resistant particles in the composition. Thus, the viscosity of the composition should facilitate uniformly loading the particles on an applicator prior to actual application. It may also be important that the viscosity of the composition be such that the composition does not excessively flow when being applied but permits an applicator to control the final thickness of the resulting floor coating. Further examples of base additives include defoamers, leveling agents, and organic wax emulsions. To provide the coatings with additional functionalities, additives such as biocides, pigments, fillers, colorants, dyes, anti-cratering agents and anti-sagging agents may also be added to the coating.</p>

      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The term âdispersionâ in this context conforms to the definition in the IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology (2007), which defines a dispersion to be a material comprising more than one phase, where at least one of the phases consists of finely divided phase domains, often in the colloidal size range, distributed throughout a continuous phase domain. The first polymer dispersion D<b>1</b> may comprise a water-based polyurethane dispersion (PUD), such as commercially available polyurethane dispersions from Dow (e.g., SYNTEGRAÂ® polyurethane dispersions) or from Bayer (e.g., BayhydrolÂ® aqueous polyurethane dispersions, or DispercollÂ® aqueous polyurethane dispersions), for example.

The volume of coating composition may be applied over a single coat, or over several consecutive coats. Curing the coat is necessary to allow volatile solvents to vaporize, thereby enabling the polymers present in the composition to phase change into a hardened state. In some embodiments, the glass transition temperature (âT<sub>g</sub>â) of the polymer blend in the coating composition is above or well above room temperature. In some exemplary embodiments, if P<b>2</b> and/or P<b>3</b> comprise rubbery elastomers, the T<sub>g </sub>may be below room temperature so the coating is relatively soft and flexible. Drying of the coating at standard ambient temperature and pressure (IUPAC) may be carried out for 0.5 to 1 hour.</p>

Comparative examples were provided using 3M Scotchgard Stone Protectorâ¢ without particles (Comparative Example 1), a coating composition obtained from polyurethane and polyacrylate without adding particles (Comparative Examples 2), and a coating composition obtained from polyurethane and polyacrylate with various size of polypropylene particles (Examples 1 to 5). <figref>FIG. 7</figref> shows a bar chart comparing the gloss values and slip resistance (numerals above bars) of each example. It can be seen that increasing particle size provided increasing slip resistance. Coatings without particles had poorer slip resistance. However, gloss was generally lower with the inclusion of particles into the coating. 30 to 60 micron-sized particles did not greatly affect the gloss of the coated floor surface, and was able to achieve improve slip resistance. Although 90 to 400 micron-sized particles reduced the gloss of the coated floor surface, slip resistance was doubled or trebled in BPN value. The 60Â° gloss value of 30 (in Example 4 &amp; 5) belongs to a good range of the gloss in the floor coating market. Also, slip resistance value of 35 BPN provides very high slip resistance properties under wet condition. Moreover, all experiments show the easy peel-off properties of the coatings in Examples 1 to 5.</p>

      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0063">Table 2 below shows a table of results obtained from different coatings with 200 micron particles with varying particle content. Likewise, comparative examples were provided using 3M Scotchgard Stone Protectorâ¢ without particles (Comparative Sample 1), a coating composition obtained from polyurethane and polyacrylate without adding particles (Comparative Sample 2), and a coating composition obtained from polyurethane and polyacrylate with varying polypropylene particle content ranging from 1% to 5% by weight (Samples 1 to 5). <figref>FIG. 8</figref> shows a bar chart comparing the gloss values and slip resistance (numerals above bars) of each Example. Slip resistance appeared to be correlated to content of particles up to about 4% by weight since formulation with particle content greater than 4% did not return higher BPN values. Conversely, gloss showed the inverse correlation with particle content, with gloss values decreasing with increasing particle content. Consequently formulations with 1% or 2% by weight of particle content provided acceptably high slip resistance (more than 35 BPN) and acceptable gloss (more than 30 at 60Â° gloss). Regarding peel-off properties, coatings in Sample 1 to 4 resulted in coatings with acceptable peel. Sample 5 with 5% of particle content was difficult to peel due to tearing during removal. Generally it was found that increasing particle content led to harder and stiffer films.</p>
