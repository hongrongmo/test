      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Embodiments disclosed herein relate to virtual environments. More specifically, embodiments disclosed herein relate to reflecting status in a virtual environment.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">A virtual world is a simulated environment in which users may interact with virtual objects and locations of the virtual world. Each user may control a respective avatar through which the user may interact with other users' avatars in the virtual world. An avatar generally provides a graphical representation of an individual within the virtual world environment. Avatars are usually presented to other users as two or three-dimensional graphical representations that resembles a human individual. Frequently, virtual worlds allow multiple users to enter the virtual environment and interact with one another. Virtual worlds are said to provide an immersive environment, as they typically appear similar to the real world and objects tend to follow rules related to gravity, topography, locomotion, physics and kinematics. Of course, virtual worlds can suspend or alter these rules as well as provide other imaginative or fanciful environments. Users typically communicate with one another through their avatars using text messages sent between avatars, real-time voice communication, gestures displayed by avatars, symbols visible in the virtual world, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Some virtual worlds are described as being persistent. A persistent world provides an immersive environment (e.g., a fantasy setting used as a setting for a role-playing game, or a virtual world complete with land, buildings, towns, and economies) that is generally always available and where events continue to occur regardless of the presence of a given avatar. Thus, unlike more conventional online games or multi-user environments, the virtual world continues to exist and plots and events continue to unfold as users enter (and exit) the virtual world. Other virtual worlds are persistent for a certain period of time, e.g., a specified number of days. Virtual environments are presented as images on a display screen and some virtual environment may allow users to record events that occur within the virtual environment.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Virtual environments seek to provide an engaging, immersive experience for its users. Some virtual environments may also encourage social activity, such as providing incentives for users to band together to complete a desired objective. Virtual environments may also provide audio content for playback by the users. However, some users may opt to play back audio content that is not provided by the virtual environment, e.g., content from a private playlist. For instance, users may disable background audio tracks of the virtual environment and use an external media player application to play back desired audio content. The media player application may run locally on a computer system of the user along with the applications that provide the virtual environment.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Some embodiments herein provide techniques to integrate the audio experience provided by user-selected audio content with the immersive experience provided by virtual environment. Doing so provides additional ways to interact with the virtual environment. At least in some cases, other users in the virtual world may also expand how they interact with the virtual environment, regardless of the audio content other users are listening to. In some embodiments, an artist associated with the audio content may participate in the virtual environment to interact with fans and to share, promote, or sell content. To that end, an avatar representing the artist may be presented near users currently listening to audio content by the artist. Presence of the avatar representing the artist thus conveys or reflects a status of one or more users of the virtual environment, e.g., in terms of audio content that the users are currently listening to.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In one embodiment, a virtual world application may be configured to identify audio content played back by a user having a player avatar in the virtual environment. The virtual world application then identifies an artist of the audio content. The virtual world then generates an artist avatar that represents the identified artist. The artist avatar serves as a companion for at least the user in the virtual environment. The artist avatar may also be referred to herein as a companion avatar.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a data flow diagram <b>100</b> illustrating an application configured to reflect status in a virtual environment, according to one embodiment presented in this disclosure. As shown, a virtual world application <b>102</b> is configured to identify audio content <b>106</b> currently being played back by a user of a player avatar <b>104</b> in the virtual environment. The virtual world application <b>102</b> is also configured to identify an artist of the audio content currently played back by the user. The virtual world application <b>102</b> is also configured to generate a companion avatar <b>108</b> representing the identified artist. At least in some embodiments, the companion avatar <b>108</b> resembles the identified artist at least in part.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In some embodiments, the companion avatar <b>108</b> may have different modes including a non-player character (NPC) mode and an artist mode. In the non-player character mode, the companion avatar <b>108</b> is computer-controlled without requiring user input, while in the artist mode, the companion avatar <b>108</b> is controlled in real-time based on input from the artist. Depending on the embodiment, the authorization and/or authentication process for artists may be the same as or different from those for non-artist users. Regardless of the mode the companion avatar <b>108</b> is in, the companion avatar <b>108</b> may be equipped with abilities that may assist the player avatar <b>104</b> in completing one or more objectives defined in the virtual environment. These abilities may be offensive in nature, defensive in nature, or provided other utility to the player avatar <b>104</b>. Further, each artist may be represented by a companion avatar with a distinct set of abilities specific to the respective artist. Further still, each companion avatar may have a distinct set of animations specific to the companion avatar, including, for example, spawning animation, movement animation, attack animation, death animation, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In some embodiments, the companion avatar <b>108</b> may additionally or alternatively provide predefined commentary pertaining to various aspects such as pertaining to the audio content being played back by the user, pertaining to the artist, pertaining to the virtual environment, pertaining to the current location of the companion avatar <b>108</b> in the virtual environment, and so forth. For instance, commentary may indicate when or how the artist composed or performed the audio content being played, the inspiration behind the audio content, etc. Depending on the embodiment, the commentary may be provided to the user by text, audio, video, or a combination thereof. Depending on the embodiment, audio or video commentary may be provided based on a recording or footage of the artist prepared ahead of time, or based on at least a text-to-speech convertor. Doing so allows the artist to provide users with behind-the-scenes content at least in some cases. In some embodiments, certain portions of the commentary may be synchronized in time to certain sections of the audio content being played back by the user, based on one or more predefined commentary synchronization rules specific to the audio content being played back.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In one embodiment, the companion avatar <b>108</b> when in NPC mode conforms to movement constraints pertaining to its location relative to the player avatar <b>104</b>. For instance, the movement constraint may preclude the companion avatar <b>108</b> in NPC mode from straying beyond a predefined travel distance from the player avatar <b>104</b> in the virtual environment. At least in some embodiments, the movement constraints may be determined and/or modified based at least in part on input from the user of the player avatar <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the movement constraints may be freely disregarded when the companion avatar <b>108</b> is in artist mode.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In some embodiments, when the companion avatar <b>108</b> is in NPC mode, exclusive cosmetic and/or gameplay aspects may be provided in the virtual environment. When the companion avatar <b>108</b> is in artist mode, additional exclusive cosmetic and/or gameplay aspects may be provided in the virtual environment. Further, for each artist, multiple instances of the companion avatar in NPC mode may coexist in the virtual environment. This allows multiple player avatars in the virtual environment to have the same companion avatar. In some embodiments, for each artist, only a single instance of the corresponding companion avatar in artist mode may coexist in the virtual environment. For each artist, however, a corresponding companion avatar in artist mode may coexist with multiple corresponding companion avatars in NPC mode. In some embodiments, the artist may alternate, in sequence, control of multiple companion avatar instances, effectively âhoppingâ from one instance to another in the virtual environment.</p>

Once the companion avatar <b>108</b><sub>1 </sub>is in artist mode, the artist may in real-time interact with Amy Brown and other users having player avatars in the vicinity in the virtual world. Further, artist-mode perks become available, while the NPC-mode perks may also remain active and optionally enhanced. Accordingly, embodiments disclosed herein may facilitate social interactions between players themselves and between players and artists, while also providing additional gameplay aspects specific to the artists represented. Consequently, the immersive aspects of the virtual environments may be improved while also providing a platform for fan interaction, brand development, and product marketing for artists. For example, in a particular embodiment, users of player avatars may take snapshots or digital audio and/or video recordings of artist appearances in the virtual environment and circulate the snapshots and digital recordings through social media, thereby increasing the profile of the virtual environment and of the artist. In this regard, the snapshots and digital recordings may be tagged with the artist when circulated through one or more designated social media applications, and the tagging also may occur automatically in some embodiments based on one or more predefined content tagging rules.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Although embodiments are described herein in conjunction with providing companion avatars representing artists of audio content, other embodiments are broadly contemplated. For instance, in some embodiments, companion avatars may be provided to represent actors and/or directors of movies, artists of graphical content, authors of books or electronic books (e-books), dancers, photographers, sculptors, architects, and so on, based on profile information of the user indicating content currently or recently enjoyed by the user, where the profile information may be specified by the user or, upon authorization by the user, retrieved from a user profile maintained by the user on a social media application. In such embodiments, the companion avatar may provide commentary pertaining to aspects such as inspiration behind a specific chapter in a book, mechanics of materials used when creating a painting or taking a photograph, etc. In some embodiments, a companion avatar may spawn additional, character avatars to provide background to a story enjoyed by the user, including one of a main character from the story, who can relay background information of the story to the user.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart depicting a method <b>600</b> to facilitate social interactions in a virtual environment and based on companion avatars, according to one embodiment presented in this disclosure. As shown, the method <b>600</b> begins at step <b>602</b>, where the virtual world application <b>102</b> determines an artist of audio content currently played back by a user of a player avatar in the virtual environment, where the audio content is selected from user content items of the user. At step <b>604</b>, the virtual world application <b>102</b> programmatically selects the companion avatar from a set of available avatars and without requiring user intervention, where the selected companion avatar conveys an identity of the artist of the audio content played back by the user of the player avatar. At step <b>606</b>, the virtual world application <b>102</b> generates an instance of the programmatically selected companion avatar. The generated instance may be assigned to or associated with the player avatar. The generated instance, which is output for display, serves as a companion for at least the player avatar in the virtual environment. The companion is configured to interact with at least the player avatar in the virtual environment. The companion conveys to at least one other player avatar in the virtual environment, that the user is currently listening to audio content by the artist, thereby facilitating social iterations in the virtual environment and pertaining to the audio content at least in some cases.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">
        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart depicting a method <b>700</b> for managing perks associated with companion avatars in a virtual environment, according to one embodiment presented in this disclosure. To this end, the method <b>700</b> may be performed for each of a set of player avatars desired to be evaluated for purposes of applying perks thereto. As shown, the method <b>700</b> begins at step <b>702</b>, where the virtual world application <b>102</b> determines whether the companion avatar is a companion to a current player avatar under evaluation. If so, then at step <b>704</b>, the virtual world application <b>704</b> applies an associated NPC-mode perk to the current player avatar. At step <b>706</b>, the method <b>700</b> enters a loop to process each additional NPC-mode perk. At step <b>708</b>, the virtual world application <b>102</b> determines whether the current player avatar satisfies eligibility criteria for receiving the NPC-mode perk. If so, then at step <b>710</b>, the virtual world application <b>102</b> applies the associated NPC-mode perk to the current player avatar.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">At step <b>712</b>, the virtual world application <b>102</b> determines whether more NPC-mode perks remain to be processed. If so, the method <b>700</b> returns to the step <b>706</b> to process a next NPC-mode perk. Otherwise, then at step <b>714</b>, the virtual world application <b>102</b> determines whether the companion avatar is in artist mode. If so, then at step <b>716</b>, the virtual world application <b>102</b> processes artist-mode perks. To that end, the virtual world application <b>102</b> may perform the steps of <b>702</b> to <b>712</b> modified to evaluate and apply artist-mode perks rather than NPC-mode perks. Consequently, when the companion avatar is in artist mode, both NPC-mode perks and artist-mode perks are applied to eligible player avatars. In some embodiments, NPC-mode perks may be magnified or otherwise altered when the companion avatar is in artist mode. In alternative embodiments, however, NPC-mode perks are not applied when the companion avatar is in artist mode.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">In one embodiment, the virtual environment includes environment content items specific to the virtual environment and not specific to any user of the virtual environment.
