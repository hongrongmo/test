      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to surgical instruments and methods for the treatment of bones or joints, in some instances surgical instruments that are matched to a particular patient's anatomy, are described herein. Also described are methods of designing and using such surgical instruments.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Conventional patient-matched instruments are provided with large surfaces that are configured to conform to a patient's unique anatomy. Successful surgical outcomes depend on the ability of patient-matched instruments to provide a reproducible, âconfidentâ 3D-fit between the patient-matched instrument and the anatomy that they are designed to rest against. If there is any doubt by an end user that a patient-matched instrument fits well upon repeated engagement with a patient's unique anatomy, or if the instrument appears to fit well with the patient's anatomy in multiple spatial orientations with respect to the anatomy, the instrument is typically discarded, and the surgery is carried out with the use of conventional, non-patient specific instruments.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">To date, at least some patient-matched surgical instruments for use in total knee arthroplasty have employed anatomy-contacting surfaces that are substantially ânegativesâ of distal femoral and proximal tibial articular joint surfaces. The anatomy-contacting surfaces are generally large surface areas that conform in a continuous manner to substantial areas of a patient's anatomy. In some instances, the custom surgical instruments are provided by obtaining 3D image data of the patient's anatomy (e.g., via an MRI scan), segmenting the 3D image data to clearly delineate surfaces of the bony and/or cartilegeneous anatomy from surrounding tissues, converting the segmented data to a computer model via CAD or other software, performing one or more optional secondary processes (e.g., smoothing functions), using a computer model to customize one or more surfaces of an instrument to the patient's anatomy, and manufacturing the custom instrument such that it is adapted to conform to the patient's anatomy in a single spatial orientation.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In at least some current practices, substantially all portions of the joint anatomy shown in each 3D image data slice are segmented and conventional patient-matched instruments are provided with anatomy-contacting portions that contact substantially continuous areas of the patient's anatomy. Such anatomy-contacting portions have large continuous surface areas of contact with the patient's bone and cartilage, and therefore, it is critical that the engineers or automated programs creating the patient-matched instruments maintain a high level of accuracy and precision throughout each step of the entire segmentation process. Even if only one or two points on anatomy-contacting surfaces of a patient-matched instrument are inaccurate, misaligned, or otherwise misrepresent the true unique anatomy of the patient, the patient-matched instrument may not fit well, sit proud, teeter, wobble, or may not fit at all. In such instances, an end user is less likely to use the instrument. In many cases, poor patient-matched instrument fit may be attributed to even a few minor errors in the segmentation process.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The various embodiments of the present invention described below and shown in the Figures provide a patient matched instrument that is designed to provide improved repeatability and reproducibility over the prior art. The patient matched instrument incorporates design features that encourage consistent placement and accurate placement.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Further areas of applicability of the invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the particular embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p>

The fixation holes <b>118</b> are dimensioned to receive pins (not shown) to temporarily fix the patient matched instrument <b>100</b> to the tibia <b>2</b>. The cutting slot <b>116</b> is dimensioned to receive a cutting instrument, such as a reciprocating blade (not shown). The body <b>114</b> has sufficient depth to provide adequate strength to the cutting slot <b>116</b> such that bending of the body and skiving of the cutting instrument may be reduced. In some embodiments, the body <b>114</b> includes a groove <b>120</b> that may be used for gaging alignment.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In use, the tibia <b>2</b> is exposed via surgical incision. The patient matched cutting block <b>100</b> is placed on the tibia <b>2</b> and located in a home position. Pins (not shown) are inserted into the fixation holes <b>118</b>. The cutting instrument is reciprocated in the cutting slot <b>116</b> to remove bone from a proximal end of the tibia <b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">As best seen in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, one of the paddles <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> may be thinner or thicker than the other paddle. In the depicted embodiment, the medial paddle has a thickness of about 5 mm. The thickness of the paddles may range from about 2 mm to about 15 mm, and more preferably from about 3 mm to about 5 mm. It is beneficial to the consistent and accurate placement of the PM instrument to minimize unintended potential contact with anatomic structures. For instance, some PM tibia instruments utilize tall or thick proximal paddles with the intent of stiffening the instrument to resist deformation errors, however, the thicker paddles may actually lead to an inability to properly place the PM instrument due to unintended contact between the paddles and one or both femoral condyles. Also, an operator, in attempting to avoid this unintentional contact may alter his or her surgical technique in order to make all femur resections prior to placing the PM tibial instrument. This is a limiting disadvantage because in doing so excludes many techniques that rely on alternating resections on the femur and tibia for the purpose of making resections based on joint balance rather than strictly based on measured resection. By designing the proximal paddles of the PM tibial instrument shorter and by limiting the posterior extent of the paddles, an operator is much more likely to place the instrument with greater accuracy as well as incorporate soft tissue balance techniques into his or her surgical technique. These benefits far outweigh the very small errors associated with deflection of the PM instrument's thinner paddles during placement.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an interior, patient matched surface of the body <b>130</b>. The patient matched surface <b>130</b> contacts an anterior surface <b>10</b> of the tibia <b>2</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the patient matched surface <b>130</b> is illustrated using a cross-hatch pattern. This is merely to highlight the area and does not indicate a texture or other surface modification; although, the patient matched area <b>130</b> could have a surface roughness different than that of the body <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, the patient matched surface <b>130</b> also contacts the anterior-proximal ridge of the tibia such that the patient matched surface contacts the tibia both superior and inferior of the cutting slot <b>116</b>. This is significant as the dual contact provides greater repeatability and reproducibility. In addition to the patient matched surface <b>130</b>, each paddle <b>110</b>,<b>112</b> has a contact surface <b>132</b>. The patient matched surface <b>130</b> and the contact surfaces <b>132</b> are used to locate the cutting slot <b>116</b> relative to the tibia.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate a second embodiment of the patient matched instrument <b>200</b>. In this second embodiment, the patient matched instrument <b>200</b> includes a built-in alignment checker <b>210</b>. The built-in alignment checker has a receiver <b>212</b> and a bridge <b>214</b>. The bridge <b>214</b> spaces the receiver <b>212</b> away from a body <b>216</b> of the patient matched instrument <b>200</b>. A user places a drop rod (not shown) in the receiver <b>212</b> to physically check the alignment of a cutting slot <b>218</b> before making a cut. Due to the material properties of some PM instruments, the shape of the bridge has a significant functional effect which can be advantageous. In the embodiment shown, the bridge is designed to rigidly constrain the alignment rod (not shown) to the PM instrument in the sagittal plane but to flexibly constrain in the coronal plane. The intent of this particular embodiment is to allow the operator to alter the sagittal alignment (posterior slope) of the PM tibial instrument while greatly reducing the operator's unintentional alteration of the coronal alignment (varus/valgus) of the PM tibial instrument. It has been found that the coronal alignment of the PM block is more consistent than the sagittal alignment. By allowing users to more accurately alter the sagittal alignment with the use of the alignment rod one but minimizing the effect of the alignment rod on the coronal alignment, the bridge shape preserves the inherent consistency of the PM instrument and allows operators to correct for any inconsistency in the sagittal plane. Other embodiments may also be beneficial to other users or with other PM instrument designs, such as a bridge which is shaped to constrain in both sagittal and coronal alignment or a bridge which is shaped to constrain coronal rather than sagittal alignment.</p>
