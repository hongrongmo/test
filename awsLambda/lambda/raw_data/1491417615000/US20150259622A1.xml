Suitable spray-type dispensers to be used according to the present invention include manually operated foam trigger type dispensers sold for example by Specialty Packaging Products, Inc. or Continental Sprayers, Inc. These types of dispensers are disclosed, for instance, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,701,311 to Dunnining et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,646,973 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,538,745 both to Focarracci. Particularly preferred to be used herein are spray-type dispensers such as T 8500Â® commercially available from Continental Spray International or T 8100Â® commercially available from Canyon, Northern Ireland. In such a dispenser, the liquid composition is divided in fine liquid droplets resulting in a spray that is directed onto the surface to be treated. Indeed, in such a spray-type dispenser the composition contained in the body of said dispenser is directed through the spray-type dispenser head via energy communicated to a pumping mechanism by the user as said user activates said pumping mechanism. More particularly, in said spray-type dispenser head the composition is forced against an obstacle, e.g., a grid or a cone or the like, thereby providing shocks to help atomise the liquid composition, i.e., to help the formation of liquid droplets.</p>

      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0116">The cleaning performance may be evaluated by the following test methods:</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0117">Kitchen or bath tiles (ceramic, enamel or stainless steel) are prepared by applying to them a representative grease- or grease/particulate-artificial soil followed by ageing (2 hours at 135Â° C.) of the soiled tiles and cooling and/or drying for 20 hours at 20Â° C. The test composition is evaluated by applying a small amount of product (e.g., 5 to 10 ml) directly to the soiled tiles and letting the test composition to act for some time (e.g., up to 1 minute). The test composition is afterwards removed from said tile either by wiping the composition of or rinsing the tile. The cleaning performance is evaluated by measuring the number of cycles needed to get a clean surface versus a reference. The result, i.e., the number of cycles, of the test composition is compared against the result of a reference composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0118">Shine Test Under Neat Conditions</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0119">The shine test is done with the black glossy ceramic tiles which are neat and cleaned with the test composition. Results are analysed by using grading described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0120">Grading in absolute scale:</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0000">0=as new/no streaks and/or film <br /> 1=very slight streaks and/or film <br /> 2=slight streaks and/or film <br /> 3=slight to moderate streaks and/or film <br /> 4=moderate streaks and/or film <br /> 5=moderate/heavy streaks and/or film <br /> 6=heavy streaks and/or film. </p>
