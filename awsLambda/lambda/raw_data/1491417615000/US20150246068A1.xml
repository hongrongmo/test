      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention include nucleoside 5â²-monophosphate derivative compounds, their preparation and their uses. In some embodiments, nucleoside 5â²-monophosphate derivative compounds are useful to treat viral infections.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Hepatitis is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that may lead to cirrhosis, primary liver cancer and other long-term complications. Nucleosides are a well-recognized class of compounds shown to be effective against a variety of viral infections, including hepatitis B, HIV, and herpes. Several nucleosides are reported to inhibit hepatitis C (HCV) virus replication, including ribavirin, which currently is marketed as a drug combination with various interferons, and the direct acting antiviral agents.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Nucleosides are generally effective as antiviral agents following conversion to the corresponding nucleoside 5â²-triphosphate (NTP). Conversion occurs inside cells through the action of various intracellular kinases. The first step, i.e. conversion of the nucleoside to the 5â²-monophosphate (NMP) is generally the slow step and involves a nucleoside kinase, which is encoded by either the virus or host. Conversion of the NMP to the NTP is generally catalyzed by host nucleotide kinases. The NTP interferes with viral replication through inhibition of viral polymerases and/or via incorporation into a growing strand of DNA or RNA followed by chain termination.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Use of synthetic nucleosides to treat viral liver infections is often complicated by several problems. In some cases, the desired nucleoside is a good kinase substrate and accordingly produces NTP in the liver as well as other cells and tissues throughout the body. Since NTP production is often associated with toxicity, nucleoside antiviral efficacy can be limited by extrahepatic toxicities. In other cases, the desired nucleoside is a poor kinase substrate which is not efficiently converted into the NMP and ultimately into the NTP. Many nucleosides have poor oral bioavailability and need to be in a prodrug form for oral use.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Ribavirin is orally available and is likely to be absorbed via a group of transporters, which may increase the likelihood of undesirable drug-drug interaction. In human subjects, Ribavirin has a relatively long half-life (Ë12 days) and may be sequestered in cells, such as red blood cells, causing anemia and other side effects. Indeed, ribavirin may be sequestered in red blood cells as long as 6-months, namely, the average lifespan of the cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">A strategy of selectively delivering ribavirin monophosphate into the liver via a transporter independent mechanism would be beneficial to patients who suffer from viral liver diseases due to an increase in the liver concentration of the biologically active ribavirin phosphates, a decrease in concentration of ribavirin outside the liver, and potentially an increase in efficacy in patients having ribavirin transporter deficiency. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,312,662 disclose the use of certain phosphate prodrugs for the liver-specific delivery of various drugs including nucleotides for the treatment of patients with liver diseases such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B and hepatocellular carcinoma.</p>

      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0111">Activation of prodrugs of this invention results in the production of a nucleoside monophosphate (NMP). NMPs are frequently further phosphorylated inside the hepatocyte to the nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) and triphosphate (NTP). Drug elimination from the hepatocyte typically entails degradation of phosphorylated metabolites back to a species capable of being transported out of the hepatocyte and into the blood for elimination by the kidney or into the bile for biliary excretion. Often with nucleoside-based drug the phosphorylated metabolites are dephosphorylated to the uncharged nucleoside.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0112">Nucleosides that leak back into the systemic circulation result in systemic exposure. If the nucleoside is active systemically, e.g. through entry into virally infected cells and phosphorylation to the active species, escape of the nucleoside from the liver leads to biological activity outside of the liver (i.e. extrahepatic tissues, blood cells). In this case, prodrugs of the invention can be effective for treating diseases outside of the liver, e.g. viral infections. Since many nucleosides exhibit poor oral bioavailability due to breakdown in the gastrointestinal tract either enzymatically (e.g. deamination by adenosine deaminase) or chemically (e.g. acid instability), the prodrug can be used for oral drug delivery. For nucleosides that are orally available via transporter-assisted absorption, the prodrug can be more effective in patients who have transporter deficiency. Moreover, given that the prodrugs in some cases are broken down or absorped slowly relative to the parent nucleoside, the prodrugs could advantageously result in increased active nucleotide exposure in the liver.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0113">In other cases, however, systemic exposure to the nucleoside can result in toxicity. This can be minimized by selecting nucleosides that are preferentially excreted through the bile or nucleosides that are unable to undergo phosphorylation in tissues or nucleosides that undergo rapid intrahepatic metabolism to a biologically inactive metabolite. Some enzymes in the hepatocyte are present that can degrade nucleosides and therefore minimize exposure (e.g. Phase I and Phase II enzymes). One example is adenosine deaminase, which can deaminate some adenosine-based nucleosides to produce the corresponding inosine analogue. Rapid intracellular deamination of the nucleoside following its dephosphorylation to the nucleoside limits systemic exposure to the nucleoside and diminishes the risk of toxicity.</p>

      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0125">The term âprodrugâ as used herein refers to any compound that when administered to a biological system generates a biologically active compound as a result of spontaneous chemical reaction(s), enzyme catalyzed chemical reaction(s), and/or metabolic chemical reaction(s), or a combination of each. Standard prodrugs are formed using groups attached to functionality, e.g. HOâ, HSâ, HOOCâ, R<sub>2</sub>Nâ, associated with the drug, that cleave in vivo. Standard prodrugs include but are not limited to carboxylate esters where the group is alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, acyloxyalkyl, alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl as well as esters of hydroxyl, thiol and amines where the group attached is an acyl group, an alkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, phosphate or sulfate. The groups illustrated are exemplary, not exhaustive, and one skilled in the art could prepare other known varieties of prodrugs. Such prodrugs of the compounds of Formula I fall within this scope. Prodrugs must undergo some form of a chemical transformation to produce the compound that is biologically active or is a precursor of the biologically active compound. In some cases, the prodrug is biologically active, usually less than the drug itself, and serves to improve drug efficacy or safety through improved oral bioavailability, pharmacodynamic half-life, etc. Prodrug forms of compounds may be utilized, for example, to improve bioavailability, improve subject acceptability such as by masking or reducing unpleasant characteristics such as bitter taste or gastrointestinal irritability, alter solubility such as for intravenous use, provide for prolonged or sustained release or delivery, improve ease of formulation, or provide site-specific delivery of the compound. Prodrugs are described in The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, by Richard B. Silverman, Academic Press, San Diego, 1992.

      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0178">General synthesis of the compounds of liver-targeting nucleoside prodrug derivatives has been discussed in detail previously (U.S. Pat. No. 7,666,855, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Scheme I describes general strategies of synthesis of the 5â²-nucleoside monophosphate prodrug analogs. The first strategy starts with protection of the 2â²,3â²-hydroxy groups of nucleosides of structure 1 to generate intermediates of structure 2. The phosphate group is introduced by reaction of compounds of structure 2 and a reagent of structure 3 to give the monophosphate compounds of structure 4 following a deprotection of the hydroxy protection groups. Treatment of compounds of structure 4 with an acylating reagent of structure 5 provides the final compounds of structure 6. Alternatively, nucleoside of structure 1 can be phosphorylated directly with reagent of structure 3 without protection of the 2â²,3â²-dihydroxy and then be acylated to afford the final compounds of structure 6. The third strategy is to prepare the intermediates of structure 7 and then is converted to final compounds of structure 6 by treatment with reagent of structure 3.</p>

The neutralized samples were centrifuged at 2,500 g for 5 min and NTP levels were determined by ion exchange phase HPLC (Hewlett Packard 1050) using a Whatman Partisil 5 SAX (5 Î¼m, 4.6Ã250 mm) column Samples (50 Î¼L) were injected onto the column in 70% 10 mM ammonium phosphate buffer and 30% 1 M ammonium phosphate buffer, both at pH 3.5 and containing 6% ethanol. Nucleoside triphosphates were eluted from the column using a linear gradient to 80% 1 M ammonium phosphate pH 3.5/6% ethanol buffer, at a flow rate of 1.25 mL/min and detected by UV absorbance (254 nm).</p>

      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0215">The liver specificity of prodrug compounds 105, 107, and 110 are compared relative to their parent nucleoside, ribavirin, in liver and other organs that could be targets of toxicity.</p>
      <heading id="h-00040-en" level="2">Methods:</heading>
      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0216">Ribavirin and their prodrugs are administered at 20 or 5 mg/kg (in terms of nucleoside equivalents) to fasted rats by oral gavage. Plasma concentrations of nucleoside are determined by HPLC-UV, and the liver and red blood cell (RBC) concentrations of the 5â²-triphosphate of the nucleoside at 1 and 5 hours after dosing are measured by LC-MS using the standard ion-pairing chromatography method for triphosphate as similar as described in Example E.</p>
      <heading id="h-00041-en" level="2">Results:</heading>
      <p id="p-00240-en" num="0217">The results are summarized in Table 1 and demonstrate the liver targeting of the ribavirin prodrugs by significantly higher Liver Targeting Index numbers. As a result, the prodrug compounds should have less chance to generate active form in RBC where the major side effect of ribavirin takes place. Although the liver NTP level of ribavirin is much higher at 1 hour after dosing, it quickly drops to a level similar to that of the prodrugs. The oral bioavailability of the prodrugs as a potential once a day drug can be optimized to achieve a liver NTP AUC level comparable to that of ribavirin currently given as twice a day.</p>
