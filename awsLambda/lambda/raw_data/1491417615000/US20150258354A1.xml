      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention is in the field of indoor climbing equipment, and more particularly in the field of devices for safely supporting automated belay devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Discussion of the State of the Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The field of recreational indoor climbing has exploded in popularity. As wider sporting audiences have engaged in indoor climbing, including many participants with minimal experience and safety knowledge, it has proven useful to provide automated belay devices to assist in safe fall control; such automated belay devices act to stop a climber's fall without requiring the climber to take any action. However, introduction of automated belay devices has caused additional problems. Such devices tend to be heavy metal discs suspended from near the top of an indoor climbing wall or similar climbing venue. With use, the automated belay devices tend to cause accelerated wear and tear on the climbing wall itself, and to cause chafing of ropes that pass through them, requiring more frequent replacement of climbing ropes than previously.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">What is needed is a device capable of sustaining substantial static and dynamic loads and comprising means of safely suspending an automated belay device at a distance from a climbing wall to reduce the wear and tear on the wall and on the ropes used in climbing.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The inventor has accordingly conceived and reduced to practice a novel and enhanced belay bar suitable for addressing the problems cited above that were introduced with the use of automated belay devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, an enhanced belay bar may comprise a rigid tube (such as constructed of a strong metal or polymer composite, or other material or combination of materials suitable for use in climbing devices) that may be partially affixed to or embedded within (such as by integrally manufacturing as a single piece, or by welding metal pieces together to form a single rigid structure) two rigid plates (again, such as may be constructed of a strong metal or other suitable materials or combination of materials for climbing uses), such that at least a portion of the tube is exposed below the plates (that is, in the direction of the ground). This design may reduce wear on a climbing rope or other tether (such as cable, webbing, or other such materials common in the art) by reducing contact surfaces that may cause friction during use, and also by minimizing the risk of friction against an exposed edge or sharp angle (such as where the tube is connected to the plates). To further reduce the risk of wear, exposed edges may be rounded or chamfered to smooth out any sharp angles and reduce abrasive surfaces, and contact surfaces may be polished or covered in a smooth abrasion-resistant or low-friction coating or material (such as a polymer, paint, or graphite coating designed to facilitate low-friction movement over the surface to which it is applied). In these ways climber safety may be improved by reducing the likelihood of catastrophic failure of their climbing tether, as well as increasing durability of such tethers and reducing the need for frequent replacement.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Further according to the embodiment, the rigid plates of the device may further comprise a plurality of angled or perpendicular (relative to the rigid plate surface) attachment surfaces, such as bent or attached metal (or other suitable material) plates, each of which may further comprise a plurality of attachment points such as mounting holes or devices, such as may be utilized to affix an enhanced belay bar to a surface such as a rock face or a climbing wall. In this manner it may be possible to affix an enhanced belay device in a variety of ways and in a variety of orientations, to a variety of surfaces according to its intended use, according to the invention. For example, an enhanced belay bar may be affixed to a non-flat surface such as a rough climbing wall designed to simulate a natural rock formation, by utilizing angled attachment surfaces designed to accommodate the shape of the surface. Additionally, in some application it may be possible to reinforce the attachment through the use of multiple attachment points or devices, to improve climber safety and reduce strain or wear on the equipment (such as a climbing wall or the enhanced belay bar itself).</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, an enhanced belay bar may further comprise a plurality of attachment points such as mounting holes or attachment devices (such as carabiners or similar clip- or snaplink-style attachment means) attached to or embedded within (such as integrally-formed mounting holes) the rigid plates described above. Such attachment points may then be used to affix various climbing equipment such as an automatic belay device (also known as auto-belay, self-belay, or assisted braking devices in the art) for use in various climbing activities such as solo climbing (without the use of a second person to belay a climber, by instead using an auto-belay device). As envisioned by the inventor, such attachment points may be positioned at a distal end of an enhanced belay bar (relative to a climbing surface to which it is attached), and the rigid plates may be tapered such as to reduce the likelihood of such an affixed auto-belay device from coming into contact with them during use, and thereby reducing wear on both the auto-belay device and the enhanced belay bar. Additionally, such a configuration allows for a suitable distance between an auto-belay device and a climbing surface, such that during use they may not come into contact, again reducing wear to an auto-belay device as well as a climbing surface.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a side view of an enhanced belay bar <b>100</b>, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. According to the embodiment, a rigid plate <b>110</b> may be affixed to a rigid hollow tube <b>115</b>, such that a portion of the tube <b>115</b> may be exposed to allow for increased range of movement of a rope that may be passed over the tube (as may be used for top-rope climbing techniques), as well as to decrease surface area friction of an enhanced belay bar <b>100</b> against a rope (i.e., contact surfaces between a rope passed over tube <b>115</b> and an enhanced belay bar device, for example contact with the tube <b>115</b> and adjacent portions of rigid plate <b>110</b>) and thus decelerate rope wear. The means of attachment may be integral (such as a metal tube welded onto a metal rigid plate), or semi-fixed or removable, interchangeably according to the invention, however as envisioned by the inventor a permanent, integrally fixed arrangement should be ideal for structural strength and to ensure safety of climbers utilizing an enhanced belay bar <b>100</b>. Additionally, the specific amount of exposure of a hollow tube <b>115</b> may vary according to a particular arrangement, and the amount of exposed tube shown is shown as an exemplary arrangement for illustration of function. It should also be appreciated that various edges of rigid plates <b>110</b> may be rounded, chamfered, or otherwise designed in such a manner as to reduce abrasion when contacting a climbing tether such as a rope, cable, or webbing (as are common in the art), to reduce wear and improve climber safety during use.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">As further illustrated, a rigid plate <b>110</b> may comprise perpendicular “wings” or rigid plate attachment surfaces <b>113</b> (shown below in perspective for clarity, referring to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>), which may further comprise a plurality of mounting holes <b>114</b> or similar attachment means to affix an enhanced belay bar <b>100</b> to a surface such as a rock face or climbing wall, according to its intended use. In this manner, an enhanced belay bar <b>100</b> may be permanently or removably fixed to a climbing surface to ensure stability during use and increase climber safety and confidence.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">As further illustrated, a plurality of attachment points <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> may be utilized at a distal portion (relative to an affixed climbing surface) of an enhanced belay bar <b>100</b>, for such purposes as to affix additional climbing equipment such as flags or markers, additional safety tethers or ropes, or assisted or automatic belay devices (as shown below, referring again to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>). In this manner, a single enhanced belay bar <b>100</b> may server multiple uses according to the specific nature of a climbing activity being performed or the preference of a particular climber utilizing the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a view showing an arrangement <b>200</b> of structural supports for an enhanced belay bar <b>100</b>, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. According to the embodiment, an enhanced belay bar <b>100</b> may be affixed (such as via attachment points <b>114</b>, described previously in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) to a rigid climbing surface <b>201</b> such as a wall or rock face. As illustrated, if an artificial climbing wall is utilized (as is common in the art, for example in indoor recreational climbing facilities), a support surface <b>210</b> such as a concrete or other reinforced wall may be utilized to anchor an enhanced belay bar <b>100</b> for additional strength and safety. As illustrated, a plurality of attachment devices such as eye bolts <b>211</b> or similar rigid, high-strength attachment means may be utilized to anchor a plurality of structural tethers <b>212</b> such as cables, chains, or other appropriate high-strength flexible attachments, that may in turn be affixed to an enhanced belay bar <b>100</b> such as by attaching or passing through attachment points described above (again, referring to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). In this manner, the strain produced during use of an enhanced belay bar <b>100</b> may be distributed between multiple tethers or anchors, as well as multiple structural components such as the climbing surface <b>201</b> and support wall <b>210</b>, to reduce the likelihood of any single component failure and increase climber safety. It should be appreciated that the specific quantity and arrangement of attachment devices <b>211</b>, tethers <b>212</b>, and surfaces <b>210</b> may vary according to the invention and as may be needed for a particular arrangement or use case, and the number and arrangement shown are used for illustrative purposes.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is a view of an alternate configuration of an enhanced belay bar supporting an automated belay device <b>310</b>, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. As illustrated, an enhanced belay bar may comprise a smooth rigid tube <b>115</b> affixed to rigid plates <b>110</b> that may further comprise perpendicular or angled attachment surfaces <b>113</b>, which may further comprise a plurality of attachment points <b>114</b> such as for anchoring within or upon a climbing surface (as illustrated previously, referring to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>). As further illustrated, rigid plates <b>110</b> may further comprise a plurality of attachment points <b>112</b> at a distal end (relative to attachment points <b>114</b> and therefore relative to a surface to which the belay bar may be affixed, as shown above in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>), that may be utilized for such purposes as attachment of external devices such as described above (referring to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">According to the embodiment, an enhanced belay bar may be oriented such that a tapered edge of a rigid plate <b>110</b> is tapered in a downward direction (as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>), or alternately in an upward-tapering direction, as is illustrated in the configurations shown in <figref>FIGS. 1</figref> and <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. It should be appreciated that any other suitable orientation may be utilized according to its intended use, according to the invention. In this manner, an enhanced belay device may be manufactured or affixed in a variety of ways to facilitate a particular use, such as to accommodate multiple attachments or multiple climbers simultaneously, or any other such use as may be desired during operation.</p>
