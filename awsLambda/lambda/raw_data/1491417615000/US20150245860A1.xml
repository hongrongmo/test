      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to bone fixation devices and methods of using the same.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Spinal fixation devices are used in orthopedic surgery to align and/or fix a desired relationship between adjacent vertebral bodies. Such devices typically include a spinal fixation element, such as a relatively rigid fixation rod, that is coupled to adjacent vertebrae by attaching the element to various anchoring devices, such as hooks, bolts, wires, or screws. The fixation rods can have a predetermined contour that has been designed according to the properties of the target implantation site, and once installed, the instrument holds the vertebrae in a desired spatial relationship, either until desired healing or spinal fusion has taken place, or for some longer period of time.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Spinal fixation devices can be anchored to specific portions of the vertebra. Since each vertebra varies in shape and size, a variety of anchoring devices have been developed to facilitate engagement of a particular portion of the bone. Pedicle screw assemblies, for example, have a shape and size that is configured to engage pedicle bone. Such screws typically include a bone screw with a threaded shank that is adapted to be threaded into a vertebra, and a rod-receiving element, usually in the form of a head having opposed U-shaped slots formed therein. The shank and rod-receiving assembly can be provided as a monoaxial assembly, whereby the rod-receiving element is fixed with respect to the shank, a unidirectional assembly, wherein the shank is limited to movement in a particular direction, e.g., within a single plane, or a polyaxial assembly, whereby the rod-receiving element has free angular movement with respect to the shank. In use, the shank portion of each screw is threaded into a vertebra, and once properly positioned, a fixation rod is seated into the rod-receiving element of each screw. The rod is then locked in place by tightening a set-screw, plug, or similar type of fastening mechanism onto the rod-receiving element.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">During open and percutaneous pedicle screw procedures, it is standard practice to attach instruments to the implant head for rod approximation, head manipulation, or to locate a pathway to the head through the skin. This attachment needs to be robust enough to attach multiple types of instruments and withstand loading axially as well as side loading during compression/distraction maneuvers and derotation.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Accordingly, there remains a need for a pedicle fixation device having various robust attachment options for multiple instruments to be easily attached.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present invention provides various embodiments of spinal anchors and methods for implanting spinal anchors. In one embodiment, a spinal implant is provided having a receiver member and a bone-engaging member extending distally from the receiver member and effective to engage a bone. The receiver member can have a base portion with first and second opposed side arms extending there from. The first and second opposed side arms can define opposed U-shaped rod-receiving recesses therebetween. The receiver member can also include one or more slots formed in a proximal portion of the outer surface of the first and second opposed side arms. The slot(s) can be configured to facilitate engagement of the receiver member by a tool, such as a rod-reduction device or various other tools used to implant or otherwise manipulate the spinal implant. The receiver member can also include various other features, such as a compression cap disposed within the receiver member and first and second bore holes formed in the outer surface of the first and second side arms. The bores holes can be configured to swage inward to lock the compression cap into the receiver member.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">While the receiver member can have a variety of configurations, in one embodiment the receiver member has opposed planar outer surfaces surrounding the U-shaped rod receiving recesses, and an outer surface of each of the first and second opposed side arms is semi-cylindrical. At least a proximal portion of an outer surface of the first and second side arms can taper inward in a proximal direction such that a width of the proximal portion of the outer surface of each of the first and second side arms is less than a width of the distal portion of the outer surface of each of the first and second side arms. In an exemplary embodiment, the first and second side arms taper inward at a location proximal to a distal-most end of the U-shaped rod-receiving recesses and distal to the first and second slots. For example, the proximal portion of the outer surface of each of the first and second side arms can taper inward at an angle. While the angle can vary, in an exemplary embodiment the angle can be in a range of about 0 to 80 degrees, and more preferably about 0 to 45 degrees, and even more preferably about 0 to 10 degrees. In an exemplary embodiment, the outer surface of each of the first and second side arms tapers inward at an angle of about 4 degrees.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The slots can also have a variety of configurations. In one embodiment, the first slot has a planar inner surface that is parallel to a planar inner surface of the second slot. Each of the first and second slots can have opposed superior and inferior surfaces, and the superior and inferior surfaces can be parallel to one another along an entire length thereof, or the superior and inferior surfaces can diverge away from one another, e.g., at opposed ends thereof. In other aspects, the superior and inferior surfaces can extend at an angle with respect to one another. While the angle can vary, in an exemplary embodiment, the angle is in the range of about 0 to 120 degrees, and more preferably about 0 to 50 degrees, and most preferably about 20 degrees.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In another embodiment, the spinal implant can have a U-shaped receiver member having an open proximal end and a substantially closed distal end, with a longitudinal axis extending there between. A bone-engaging member can extend from the substantially closed distal end of the receiver member, and it can be effective to engage bone. The U-shaped receiver member can have opposed U-shaped cut-outs formed therein and configured to seat a spinal fixation rod. The U-shaped receiver member can also have first, second, third, and fourth distinct slots formed therein at a location proximal to a distal end of the U-shaped cut-outs.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In one aspect, the U-shaped receiver member includes first and second side arms defining the U-shaped cut-outs, and the first side arm has the first and second slots formed therein, and the second side arm has the third and fourth slots formed therein. Each of the first and second side arms can have a planar outer surface extending between opposed substantially semi-cylindrical lateral outer surfaces. Each slot can be disposed across both a portion of the planar outer surface of one of the side arms and a portion of one of the opposed semi-cylindrical lateral outer surfaces of one of the first and second side arms. The first, second, third, and fourth slots can all extend in the same plane and can be spaced radially around the receiver member.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In another embodiment, a spinal implant is provided having a receiver member with first and second opposed side arms extending between an open proximal end and a distal end, and opposed U-shaped rod-receiving recesses formed between the first and second opposed side arms. The U-shaped rod-receiving recesses can extend from the open proximal end and terminating proximal to the distal end. In one aspect, each of the first and second opposed side arms has a distal planar outer surface and a tapering outer surface that extends proximally from the distal planar outer surface and that tapers inward in a proximal direction. Each side arm can also include a proximal lip formed on a proximal end thereof and extending laterally between opposed lateral edges of the side arm, and the proximal lip having an inferior surface that abuts the tapering outer surface. The implant can further include a bone-engaging member extending from the distal end of the receiver member and effective to engage bone</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In one embodiment, the inferior surface can extend at an angle relative to a superior surface of the proximal lip. While the angle can vary, in one embodiment the angle can be in the range of about 0 to 89 degrees, and more preferably about 0 to 30 degrees, and most preferably the angle is about 10 degrees. The distal planar surfaces of the first and second opposed side arms can be perpendicular to the inferior surface of the proximal lip on each of the first and second opposed side arms. Each of the first and second opposed side arms can also include a bore formed in the distal planar outer surface.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Certain exemplary embodiments will now be described to provide an overall understanding of the principles of the structure, function, manufacture, and use of the devices and methods disclosed herein. One or more examples of these embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Those skilled in the art will understand that the devices and methods specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings are non-limiting exemplary embodiments and that the scope of the present invention is defined solely by the claims. The features illustrated or described in connection with one exemplary embodiment may be combined with the features of other embodiments. Such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Various exemplary spinal implant devices and methods are provided. In general, the devices and methods provide various robust attachment options for multiple instruments to be easily attached. In general, spinal implants are provided that allow for attachment to various instruments for various reasons, such as for rod approximation, head manipulation, or to locate a pathway to the receiver head through the skin. The implants can allow for these attachments, while being robust enough to withstand axial loading as well as side loading during various surgical maneuvers and manipulations, such as compression/distraction and derotation.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The spinal implants disclosed herein include a generally U-shaped rod-receiving head or receiver member having an open proximal end and a distal end coupled to a bone-engaging member, such as a bone screw, bone hook, etc. The receiver member can have two side arms extending proximally from the distal end to the open proximal end, and defining a U-shaped channel therebetween to receive a spinal fixation element, such as a spinal rod. The side arms of the receiver can have various configurations and can include engagement features, such as slots or grooves, by which various tools can grasp the receiver member to manipulate the implant in various ways. Various configurations of the side arms can provide additional benefits, such as robustness or elimination of directionality when mating to various instruments.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">
        <figref>FIGS. 1A-1D</figref> illustrate one embodiment of a bone screw assembly <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>, the bone screw assembly <b>100</b> generally includes a receiver member <b>112</b> for receiving a spinal fixation element, such as a spinal rod, and a bone-engaging member <b>114</b> for engaging bone. The receiver member <b>112</b> and the bone-engaging member <b>114</b> can be joined in a variety of ways. For example, the bone-engaging member <b>114</b> can be fixedly mated to or integrally formed with the receiver member <b>112</b> to form a monoaxial assembly. Alternatively, it can be unidirectional, such that movement of the bone-engaging member is limited to a single direction, e.g., along a single plane, or it can be polyaxially coupled to the receiver member <b>112</b> to allow angular movement of the receiver member <b>112</b> relative to the bone-engaging member <b>114</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The receiver member <b>112</b> can have a variety of configurations. In the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, the receiver member <b>112</b> is in the form of a substantially U-shaped head with opposed first and second side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>that extend proximally from a substantially closed distal base portion or distal end <b>112</b><i>d </i>to an open proximal end <b>112</b><i>p. </i>The side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>are separated by opposed U-shaped slots that define a U-shaped channel <b>117</b> extending through the receiver head <b>112</b> for seating a spinal fixation element, such as a rod. The slots that define the channel <b>117</b> can extend distally from the open proximal end <b>112</b><i>p </i>and they can terminate at a location proximal to the closed distal end <b>112</b><i>d </i>such that a spinal fixation element extending through the channel <b>117</b> is positioned a distance above the distal end <b>112</b><i>d </i>of the receiver <b>112</b>. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the receiver member <b>112</b> can be configured to receive a variety of fixation elements. Suitable spinal fixation elements for use with the present invention include, by way of non-limiting examples, rods, tethers, cables, plates, etc. The spinal fixation elements can have a variety of configurations, and, by way of non-limiting example, can be rigid, semi-rigid, bendable, flexible, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The substantially closed distal base portion <b>112</b><i>d </i>can have a variety of configurations, but in general the base portion <b>112</b><i>d </i>can have a substantially cylindrical shape. However, a distal portion of the outer surface of the base portion <b>112</b><i>d </i>can taper inward to have a truncated conical shape. The base portion can also include opposed planar sidewalls <b>115</b><i>a, </i><b>115</b><i>b </i>(shown in <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1F</figref>) formed thereon. The planar sidewalls <b>115</b><i>a, </i><b>115</b><i>b </i>can be positioned distal of the U-shaped slots that define channel <b>117</b>, and the can extend partially around each slot. The planar sidewalls <b>115</b><i>a, </i><b>115</b><i>b </i>can also be positioned to extend between opposed lateral edges of the side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b. </i>While not shown, the base portion <b>112</b><i>d </i>can have a concave cavity formed therein that seats a portion of the bone-engaging member <b>114</b>, and an opening extending therethrough that allows the bone-engaging member <b>114</b> to extend therethrough and into bone, as discussed in more detail below. As indicated above, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that the base portion can be integrally formed and/or fixedly mated to the bone engaging member.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The side arms of the receiver member can also have various configurations. For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>, the side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>can extend substantially parallel to one another, and an outer surface of each side arm <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>can be semi-cylindrical. A proximal portion (only portion <b>116</b><i>ap </i>is shown) of an outer surface of each of the first and second side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>can, however, taper inward toward one another. In particular, as best shown in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>, an outer surface of a proximal portion of the first and second side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>ca taper inward, while an inner surface of each side arm <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>remains equidistant to an inner surface of the other side arm <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>along the entire length thereof. In an exemplary embodiment, the first and second side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>taper inward at a location proximal to a distal end <b>117</b><i>d </i>of the U-shaped channel <b>117</b> and distal to the slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b, </i>which will be discussed in more detail below. The taper can also begin at a location proximal to opposed bores <b>120</b><i>a, </i><b>120</b><i>b </i>formed in each side arm <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b, </i>as will also be discussed in detail below. The angle of the taper can vary. While the angle can vary, in an exemplary embodiment the angle α can be in a range of about 0 to 80 degrees, and more preferably about 0 to 45 degrees, and even more preferably about 0 to 10 degrees. In an exemplary embodiment, the outer surface of each of the first and second side arms tapers inward at an angle α of about 4 degrees, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>can also have a width extending between the opposed lateral edges that varies along the height of the side arm. In the illustrated embodiment, as best shown in <figref>FIG. 1C</figref>, each side arm <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>decreases in width at a proximal portion thereof such that the side arms have a lateral width x<sub>1 </sub>at the proximal portion (only portion <b>116</b><i>ap </i>is shown) that is less than a lateral width x<sub>2 </sub>of a distal portion (only portion <b>116</b><i>ad </i>is shown) of each of the first and second side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b. </i>As a result, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1C</figref>, the opposed lateral edges of the proximal portion <b>116</b><i>ap </i>of each of the first and second side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>extends parallel to the opposed lateral edges of the distal portion <b>116</b><i>ad </i>of each of the first and second side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b. </i>Opposed lateral edges of both the proximal portion <b>116</b><i>ap </i>and the distal portion <b>116</b><i>ad </i>of the first and second side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>can also be substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis Z of the spinal implant <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The dimensions of the receiver member <b>112</b> can vary dependent upon the intended use, but in an exemplary embodiment, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>, the receiver member <b>112</b> can have a height H measured from a distal-most end of the substantially closed distal portion <b>112</b><i>d </i>to a proximal-most end of the open proximal end <b>112</b><i>p </i>that is in the range of about 9 mm to 150 mm and more preferably is about 14.5 mm. The substantially closed distal base portion <b>112</b><i>d </i>can have a maximum outer diameter D that is in the range of about 8 mm to 16 mm, and more preferably 13 mm. The open proximal end <b>112</b><i>p </i>of the receiver member <b>112</b> can have a minimum outer diameter D<sub>p </sub>that is in the range of about 6 mm to 16 mm, and more preferably about 13 mm. As will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art, the receiver member <b>112</b> can be formed from various biocompatible materials including, by way of non-limiting example, surgical grade titanium, surgical grade stainless steel, cobalt chromium, and nitinol.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The receiver member <b>112</b> can further include one or more engagement features, such as slots, formed on an external surface of the side arms for mating to various tools. As shown in the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, an outer surface of each of the side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>of the receiver member <b>112</b> includes first and second slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>formed therein for mating to a tool, such as a grasping tool, for example. Though this embodiment shows slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>located in the side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b, </i>the slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>can alternatively be located in the opposed substantially planar sides <b>115</b><i>a, </i><b>115</b><i>b. </i>The slots can have various configurations, but as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, the slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>extend in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis Z, and more preferably perpendicular to the longitudinal axis Z. The position of the slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>can vary, but they are preferably positioned proximal to the distal end <b>117</b><i>d </i>of the U-shaped channel <b>117</b>, and in an exemplary embodiment they are thus located on a proximal portion of the outer surface of the side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b. </i>The position of slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>can depend on the material from which the receiver member is constructed. For example, where the receiver head is formed from a more resilient material, the slots can be positioned closer to the proximal end <b>112</b><i>p </i>of the receiver member <b>112</b> to allow the receiver member <b>112</b> to withstand the forces and pressures placed on the proximal end <b>112</b><i>p </i>by an attached tool. The position of slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>is particularly advantageous in that it facilitates engagement of the bone screwassembly <b>100</b> by a rod approximator since the grasping tool, for example, does not need to grasp the bone screw assembly <b>100</b> underneath the receiver member <b>112</b>. The position of the slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>also avoids potential contact with adjacent bone structures.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>can have various shapes and sizes as well, and various cutting techniques can be used to form the slots in the receiver member. In the illustrated embodiment, the slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>are planar cut. In particular, the slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>are made with a cutting tool that forms elongated slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>having opposed upper and lower shoulders or superior and inferior surfaces <b>119</b><i>a, </i><b>119</b><i>b, </i>connected by a planar back surface <b>119</b><i>c, </i>as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>. The upper and lower shoulders <b>119</b><i>a, </i><b>119</b><i>b </i>can extend parallel to one another along an entire length thereof. The planar back surface <b>119</b><i>c </i>can be parallel to the axis Z of the receiver member <b>112</b>. The upper and lower shoulders <b>119</b><i>a, </i><b>119</b> can extend perpendicular to the axis Z of the receiver member <b>112</b> and to the planar back surface <b>119</b><i>c. </i>In another embodiment, the upper and/or lower shoulders <b>119</b><i>a, </i><b>119</b><i>b </i>can extend at an angle greater or less than 90 degrees relative to axis Z. For example, <figref>FIG. 1G</figref> illustrates an embodiment of opposed slots having upper and lower shoulders <b>119</b><i>a</i>″, <b>119</b><i>b</i>″ that are angled relative to one another. While the angle α′ can vary, in an exemplary embodiment, the angle α′ is in the range of about 0 to 120 degrees, and more preferably about 0 to 50 degrees, and most preferably about 20 degrees. In another embodiment, shown in <figref>FIG. 1H</figref>, the shoulders <b>119</b><i>a</i>′″, <b>119</b><i>b</i>′″ can diverge away from one another at opposed terminal ends of the slots such that each slot has a dovetail shape and a distance between the superior and inferior surfaces is greater at the opposed terminal ends than at the mid-portion of the slot. Alternatively, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1I</figref>, the shoulders <b>119</b><i>ax</i>, <b>119</b><i>ay </i>can converge at opposed terminal ends of the slots, such that the midportion has a width between the superior and inferior surfaces that is greater than a width at the ends of the slots. In another embodiment, both the upper and lower shoulders can be substantially planar, but the upper shoulder can include opposed ends that are curved such that they extend proximally away from the lower shoulder. The curved shape of the upper shoulder can allow arms of a tool, such as a grasping member, to be inserted into the slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>at an angle. Though the slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>shown in the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 1A-D</figref> are planar cut, they can alternatively be radially cut such that the back surface is curved rather than planar.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The size of each slot <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>can vary depending on the tool intended to be used with the receiver member. For example, the length of each slot, as measured between opposed terminal ends of the slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>can have a length that is at least about 50% of the width x<sub>1 </sub>of the arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b. </i>The depth can also vary, but preferably the slots have a depth sufficient to allow a tool to grasp the receiver member <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, the slots <b>118</b><i>a. </i><b>118</b><i>b </i>can have a length in the range of about 2 mm to 12 mm, and a depth in the range of about 0.5 mm to 3 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The bone-engaging member, which anchors the bone screw to bone and can be mated to the receiver member, can also have a variety of configurations. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1C</figref>, the bone-engaging member <b>114</b> is in the form of a bone screw having a proximal head <b>114</b><i>p </i>and a distal elongate shank portion <b>114</b><i>d </i>with threads <b>124</b> formed on an outer surface thereof for engaging bone. The proximal head <b>114</b><i>p </i>can have a drive feature on a proximal portion thereof (not shown). In an exemplary embodiment, the drive feature on the proximal head <b>114</b><i>p </i>is identical in shape and size to the drive feature of a closure mechanism used to lock the spinal fixation rod in the receiver head, as will be discussed in more detail below. This reduces the number of tools required during surgery. The distal tip of the shank <b>114</b><i>d </i>can also have a variety of configurations, and in one embodiment it can be self-tapping. The shank <b>114</b><i>d </i>can also be cannulated for advancing the shank over a guidewire, or it can be non-cannulated. The shank <b>114</b><i>d </i>can further include one or more fenestrations for allowing a material, such as a cement, to be injected into the shank. The size of the bone-engaging member <b>114</b> and the threads <b>124</b> can vary depending on the intended use. In certain exemplary embodiments, the bone-engaging member <b>114</b> can have a length L<sub>2 </sub>in the range of about 8 mm to 150 mm. The diameter D<sub>2 </sub>of the proximal head <b>114</b><i>p </i>can vary, and can be in the range of about 4 mm to 10 mm. A minor diameter d<sub>m </sub>of the shank <b>114</b><i>d </i>can remain constant along the entire length of the shank <b>114</b><i>d, </i>or the minor diameter d<sub>m </sub>can decrease in a proximal-to-distal direction, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. A major diameter d<sub>M </sub>of the shank <b>114</b>, i.e., the diameter of the threads <b>124</b>, can also vary, and can remain constant or can likewise taper. The major diameter d<sub>M </sub>can be in the range of about 3 mm to 12 mm, and the minor diameter d<sub>m </sub>can be in the range of about 2.0 mm to 10 mm. A thread pitch, or number of threads per unit length, can also vary, and in one embodiment the thread pitch can be in the range of about 1 mm to 4 mm. The bone-engaging member <b>114</b> can also be formed from various biocompatible materials including, by way of non-limiting example, surgical grade titanium, surgical grade stainless steel, cobalt chromium, and nitinol. It can be formed from either the same or different materials as the receiver member <b>112</b>. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that, while a bone screw is shown, various other bone implants can be used, such as spinal hooks, cross connectors, plates, staples or fixation element connectors.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The bone-engaging member <b>114</b> can be coupled to the receiver in various ways. It can be fixedly mated to and/or integrally formed with the receiver member <b>112</b> such that the assembly is monoaxial, or alternatively, the bone-engaging member <b>114</b> can be unidirectional or polyaxially coupled to the receiver member <b>112</b> to allow angular movement of the receiver member relative to the shank. A variety of techniques can be used to allow angular movement of the receiver member <b>112</b> with respect to the bone-engaging member <b>114</b>. By way of non-limiting example, the proximal head <b>114</b><i>p </i>can be hemispherical and can be seated in a concave cavity formed in the base portion of the receiver member <b>112</b>, with the bone-engaging member <b>114</b> extending through the opening formed in the substantially closed distal portion <b>112</b><i>d </i>of the receiver member <b>112</b> such that in can be angularly oriented relative to the receiver member <b>112</b>. The proximal head <b>114</b><i>p </i>can prevent the bone-engaging member <b>114</b> from extending completely through the opening or an additional component may be added to retain the bone engaging member within the receiver. This configuration is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1D</figref>. As a result, the bone screw assembly <b>100</b> can be assembly using a top loading approach, in which the bone-engaging member <b>114</b> is inserted into the top of the receiver member <b>112</b> and advanced through the opening in the bottom of the receiver member <b>112</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the bone screw assembly can be bottom loading, in which the bone-engaging member is inserted into the bottom of the receiver. Such a configuration is illustrated, by way of non-limiting example, in <figref>FIG. 1E</figref>. As shown, the bone-engaging member <b>114</b>′ has a post <b>115</b>′ at the proximal end, rather than a head. This allows the post <b>115</b>′ to be inserted into the bottom of the receiver <b>112</b>′, and engaged by a separate head <b>114</b><i>p</i>′. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that in any embodiment disclosed herein, the bone-engaging member can be top loading or bottom loading.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The implant can also have a compression cap that, when compressed by a spinal fixation element, can lock the bone-engaging member <b>114</b> into a fixed position such that it is no longer movable. For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1C</figref>, the bone screw assembly <b>100</b> can include a compression cap <b>130</b> that is received in the receiver member <b>112</b> and configured to be positioned between the proximal head <b>114</b><i>p </i>of the bone-engaging member <b>114</b>, and a spinal fixation element, such as a rod, disposed within the U-shaped channel <b>117</b> of the receiver member <b>112</b>. The compression cap <b>130</b> can have a hole formed therethrough such that the drive feature on the proximal head <b>114</b><i>p </i>of the bone-engaging member is accessible when the compression cap <b>130</b> is disposed within the U-shaped channel <b>117</b> over the proximal head <b>114</b><i>p. </i>The compression cap <b>130</b> can allow free polyaxial movement of the receiver member <b>112</b> relative to the shank <b>114</b> when a spinal fixation element is disposed within the receiver member <b>112</b>, and the compression cap <b>130</b> can be configured to lock the shank <b>114</b> in a fixed orientation relative to the receiver <b>112</b> when a closure mechanism <b>180</b> is applied to the receiver member <b>112</b> to lock the spinal fixation element relative to the receiver <b>112</b>. In other embodiments, the compression cap can be configured to lock the bone-engaging member in a fixed position relative to the receiver member without locking the spinal fixation element relative to the receiver. A separate closure mechanism can be used to lock the spinal fixation element to the receiver member.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The receiver member <b>112</b> can also include features to retain and/or lock the compression cap <b>130</b> therein. For example, an outer surface of each side arm <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>can include first and second bores <b>120</b><i>a, </i><b>120</b><i>b </i>formed therein, and an inner sidewall of each arm <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>can be deformable such that, when a pin or other member is inserted into each bore <b>120</b><i>a, </i><b>120</b><i>b, </i>the deformable portion swages inward to engage the compression cap <b>130</b> and prevent proximal movement of the compression cap <b>130</b> disposed within the receiver member <b>112</b>. The bores <b>120</b><i>a, </i><b>120</b><i>b </i>can be positioned at any location on the receiver member <b>112</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the bores <b>120</b><i>a, </i><b>120</b><i>b </i>are positioned at a mid-portion of each side arm <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b</i>, and at a location distal to the first and second slots <b>118</b><i>a, </i><b>118</b><i>b. </i>As will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art, the compression cap <b>130</b> can be formed from various biocompatible materials including, by way of non-limiting example, surgical grade titanium, surgical grade stainless steel, cobalt chromium, nitinol, PEEK and plastics. It can be formed from either the same or different materials as the receiver member <b>112</b> and the bone-engaging member <b>114</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Various closure mechanisms known in the art can be used to lock a spinal fixation member in the receiver member. The closure mechanism can engage with the receiver member <b>112</b> in various ways. For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1F</figref>, the closure mechanism is a set screw <b>180</b> that is received in the open proximal end <b>112</b><i>p </i>of the receiver member <b>112</b>, between the side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b. </i>The receiver member <b>112</b> can include various features for mating with a closure mechanism, for example, in an exemplary embodiment, threads <b>122</b> on the proximal portion of the inner surface of the side arms <b>116</b><i>a, </i><b>116</b><i>b </i>mate with the corresponding threads on the set screw <b>180</b> to lock a spinal fixation rod therein, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1D</figref>. The set screw <b>180</b> can also include a drive feature <b>182</b> therethrough or located on a proximal portion thereof. As indicated above, the drive feature <b>182</b> can match the drive feature of proximal head <b>114</b><i>p </i>such that the same tool can be used on both drive features, or the drive feature can be different than that of the proximal head <b>114</b><i>p. </i>While a set screw is illustrated, alternative closure mechanisms can be used, e.g., external locking nut, or a combination internal and external, etc. As will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art, the closure mechanism can be formed from various biocompatible materials including, by way of non-limiting example, surgical grade titanium, surgical grade stainless steel, cobalt chromium, and nitinol. It can be formed from either the same or different materials as the receiver member <b>112</b>, the bone-engaging member <b>114</b>, and the compression cap <b>130</b>.</p>

In an exemplary embodiment, the maximum outer diameter of the receiver member is in the range of about 8 mm to 16 mm, and the slots have a diameter that is in the range of about 7 mm to 15 mm.

      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The tapering outer surface <b>316</b><i>ap</i>, <b>316</b><i>bp </i>of each side arm <b>316</b><i>a, </i><b>316</b><i>b </i>can terminate at a location just distal to the proximal-most end of the receiver member, such that each side arms <b>316</b><i>a, </i><b>316</b><i>b </i>includes a proximal lip <b>318</b><i>a, </i><b>318</b><i>b </i>formed thereon extending between opposed lateral edges of the side arm <b>316</b><i>a, </i><b>316</b><i>b </i>at proximal end <b>312</b><i>p. </i>Each lip can have a width that is substantially the same as a width of the side arms <b>316</b><i>a, </i><b>316</b><i>b. </i>The proximal lip <b>318</b><i>a, </i><b>318</b><i>b </i>can have an inferior surface <b>319</b><i>b </i>that abuts the tapering outer surface <b>316</b><i>ap</i>, <b>316</b><i>bp</i>. The proximal lip can also have a superior surface <b>319</b><i>a </i>that is located at the proximal end <b>312</b><i>p </i>of the receiver member <b>312</b>. As shown in the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>, the inferior surface <b>319</b><i>b </i>can be located a distance q<sub>2 </sub>from the superior surface <b>319</b><i>a, </i>and thus from the proximal end <b>312</b><i>p. </i>In an exemplary embodiment, the distance q<sub>2 </sub>between the inferior surface <b>319</b><i>b </i>of the proximal lip <b>318</b><i>a, </i><b>318</b><i>b </i>is in the range of about <b>1</b> mm to <b>4</b> mm, making the proximal lip <b>318</b><i>a, </i><b>318</b><i>b </i>of thisembodiment relatively narrow. One reason this is possible is that that the proximal lip <b>318</b><i>a</i>, <b>318</b><i>b </i>can provide a more robust attachment than other grasping elements, such as slots, on the receiver member <b>312</b> for instruments to grasp due to the length of the proximal lip <b>318</b><i>a, </i><b>318</b><i>b</i>. In particular, the proximal lip <b>318</b><i>a, </i><b>318</b><i>b </i>can provide more material, i.e., an entire width of a side arm <b>316</b><i>a, </i><b>316</b><i>b </i>for attachment and can thereby accommodate a thinner profile than, for example, the slots <b>218</b><i>a, </i><b>218</b><i>b, </i><b>218</b><i>c, </i><b>218</b><i>d </i>in the previous embodiment, which each only provide a corner of the receiver member <b>212</b> for an instrument to grasp. The greater surface area for grasping provided by the proximal lip <b>318</b><i>a, </i><b>318</b><i>b </i>allows for a narrower distance q<sub>2 </sub>between the grasping element and the proximal end <b>312</b><i>p </i>than in other embodiments which have smaller surface areas for grasping, e.g., the distance q in receiver member <b>212</b>. The superior and inferior surfaces <b>319</b><i>a, </i><b>319</b><i>b </i>of the proximal lip <b>318</b>, <b>318</b><i>b </i>can be parallel to each other and can be perpendicular to the longitudinal axis Z of the receiver member. Alternatively, the inferior surface <b>319</b><i>b </i>can extend at an angle α<sub>2 </sub>relative to a superior surface <b>319</b><i>a </i>of the proximal lip. While the angle α<sub>2 </sub>can vary, in one embodiment the angle α<sub>2 </sub>can be in the range of about 0 to 89 degrees, and more preferably about 0 to 30 degrees, and most preferably the angle is about 10 degrees. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the angle α<sub>2 </sub>can result from one or both surfaces <b>319</b><i>a, </i><b>319</b><i>b </i>extending at an angle other than 90 degrees relative to the axis z.</p>

      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The illustrated spinal implants can be used to stabilize a variety of bone structures, including by way of non limiting example, vertebral bodies, lateral masses, lamina and transverse process. Where the desired use of the spinal implant is for implantation in a bony element, the first step is positioning and driving the anchor, e.g., the bone screw, to the desired depth in the vertebra. When the bone screw is cannulated, a guidewire can be used to position the bone screw. The cannulated bone screw can be advanced over the guidewire, which allows placement of the bone screw at a desired depth in bone. A pre-drilled hole can optionally be formed prior to advancing the bone screw over the guidewire. In addition to the cannulation, the bone screw could have one or more fenestrations formed therein for allowing a material, such as a cement, to be injected into the bone screw to enhance fixation. When the bone screw is non-cannulated, the screw is preferably inserted into a hole that is pre-drilled in bone using a drilling tool. Both cannulated and non-cannulated screws can be self-tapping to allow the screw to drive through bone. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that various techniques known in the art can be used to implant the bone screw in bone.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">In use, when two bone screws are fixed in adjacent vertebra, a spinal fixation element can be inserted into the receiver member of each screw. It can be difficult to position the spinal fixation element within each receiver member because of the alignment of the bone screws and the dimensions of the surgical site. As a result, a rod approximator or reduction device can be used to place the fixation element in the receiver members. For example, the arms of the rod approximator device can include a grasping member with arms that contain grasping elements that fit into the corresponding recesses on the receiver member of the bone screw, stabilizing the rod approximator relative to the bone screw. With the rod pusher member in a first, proximal position, the device can be manipulated to place the spinal rod between a rod engaging member and the receiver member. The rod approximator can also include first and second handle members that can be grasped and squeezed together to cause the rod pusher member to move to a second, distal position, thereby causing the rod engaging member to grasp and push the fixation rod into the receiver member of the bone screw. After the rod is advanced into the receiver member, a closure mechanism can be applied to the receiver member of the bone screw to secure the rod.</p>
