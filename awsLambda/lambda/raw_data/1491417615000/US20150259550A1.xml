      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In the present invention, âthe inorganic pigment is not present in a pore opening of the porous particleâ encompasses the case where âthe inorganic pigment is not substantially present in a pore opening of the porous particleâ. âThe inorganic pigment is not substantially present in a pore opening of the porous particleâ means that the pigment for ink-jet recording may contain a small amount of the inorganic pigment in the pore opening within the favorable range of the pigment density described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">As mentioned above, the pigment for ink-jet recording comprises: a porous particle; a sealing agent; and an inorganic pigment layer comprising an inorganic pigment, the sealing agent is arranged in a pore opening of the porous particle, and the inorganic pigment layer is formed on the surface of the porous particle.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Examples of the porous particle include a porous silicon oxide particle such as porous silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) particle, a porous alminosilicate particle such as zeolite, a porous aluminium oxide particle, a porous zirconium oxide particle, and active carbon, and the porous particle is, for example, a porous silica particle.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The sealing agent is not particularly limited as long as it is arranged in a pore opening of the porous particle and is, for example, a chemical compound of organic silicon. Examples of the chemical compound of organic silicon include alkoxysilane such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), trialkylmonosilane such as trimethylmonosilane, alkylsilane such as hexamethyldisilane, and fluoroalkylsilane such as a silane coupling agent having a perfluoroalkyl group.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The inorganic pigment is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include titanium oxide, sulfate of alkali earth metal, carbonate of alkali earth metal, silica (for example, fine-powdered silicic acid, synthesized silicate), calcium silicate, alumina, hydrated alumina, zinc oxide, talc, and clay. Any one of them may be used alone, or two or more of them may be used in combination. Among them, the inorganic pigment is, for example, titanium oxide.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The method for producing a pigment for ink-jet recording is described below with reference to (a) to (c) in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The method, however, is merely an example and the pigment for ink-jet recording may be produced by another method.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">As shown in (a) and (b) in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, a sealing agent <b>4</b> is arranged on the entire surface including the outer peripheral surface <b>2</b> of a porous particle <b>1</b> and the inner surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of a pore opening <b>3</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">As the porous particle <b>1</b>, a commercially available porous particle or a self-prepared porous particle may be used. The porous silica particle may be prepared by causing the inside and the surface of an aggregate of ultrafine powder such as as calcium carbonate or the like as a base particle (core) to be immersed in and coated with silica, then dissolving the ultrafine powder in acid, and thereafter drying the ultrafine powder, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The arrangement of the sealing agent <b>4</b> may be performed by a reflux method or a supercritical method using an autoclave, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Then, as shown in (c) in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the inorganic pigment layer <b>5</b> comprising an inorganic pigment is formed on the surface of the porous particle <b>1</b>. The inorganic pigment layer <b>5</b> may be formed by stirring a solution containing the porous particle <b>1</b> and the inorganic pigment with ultrasound, then subjecting the solution to centrifugal separation, and thereafter washing, drying, and firing the obtained precipitate, for example. At that time, the sealing agent <b>4</b> is arranged in the pore opening <b>3</b> of the porous particle <b>1</b>. Thus, the entering of the inorganic pigment into the pore opening <b>3</b> is significantly suppressed, and a hollow pigment with a low density can be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The density of the pigment for ink-jet recording is, for example, 1.7 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 2.8 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. With the density range, the sedimentation velocity in a solvent may be about Â½ or less of the case where the inorganic pigment is entered into the pore opening <b>3</b> of the porous particle <b>1</b>, and the pore opening <b>3</b> is completely filled with the inorganic pigment, and the pigment for ink-jet recording may be further superior in dispersibility in a solvent. Moreover, in the case where titanium oxide is used as the inorganic pigment, the pigment for ink-jet recording with further superior brightness (L*) may be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The application of the pigment for ink-jet recording is not particularly limited, and the pigment for ink-jet recording may be applied widely in various inks, various paints, and the like as well as a pigment ink for ink-jet recording described below, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Then, a pigment ink for ink-jet recording (hereinafter also referred to as a âpigment inkâ or an âinkâ.) is described below. The pigment ink for ink-jet recording comprises the pigment for ink-jet recording. The pigment ink for ink-jet recording may be used in ink-jet recording on recording paper, a transparent sheet such as an OHP sheet, or the like or may be used in ink-jet recording on fabric.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The amount of the pigment for ink-jet recording to be added in the pigment ink for ink-jet recording is not particularly limited and is, for example, 1 wt % to 25 wt %, 3 wt % to 20 wt %, 5 wt % to 15 wt %, relative to the total amount of the pigment ink.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The pigment ink for ink-jet recording may further contain a coloring agent other than the pigment for ink-jet recording. Examples of the coloring agent other than the pigment for ink-jet recording include a pigment other than the pigment for ink-jet recording and a dye.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The pigment ink for ink-jet recording may further contain a pigment dispersant in order to further improve dispersibility of the pigment. The pigment dispersant may be, for example, a polyacrylic resin. The amount of the pigment dispersant to be added relative to the total amount of the pigment ink is, for example, 0 wt % to 10 wt %, 2 wt % to 7 wt %.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The pigment ink for ink-jet recording may further contain water. The water is, for example, distilled water, ion-exchange water, or pure water. The amount of the water to be added relative to the total amount of the pigment ink for ink-jet recording is, for example, the balance of the pigment ink for ink-jet recording, excluding other components.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The pigment ink for ink-jet recording may further contain a humectant. The humectant prevents the ink from drying at the tip of the ink-jet head, for example.

      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The pigment ink for ink-jet recording comprises the pigment for ink-jet recording and is thus superior in dispersibility. Therefore, as mentioned below, in an ink cartridge containing the pigment ink for ink-jet recording, generation of a precipitate (sedimentation of the pigment) is suppressed. Moreover, by the use of the pigment ink for ink-jet recording, the deposition of the pigment in an ink flow path of an ink-jet recording apparatus and the clogging of an ink-jet head by the pigment are suppressed.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">An ink cartridge contains an ink, and the ink is the pigment ink. The pigment ink is superior in dispersibility, so that generation of the precipitate (sedimentation of the pigment) in the ink cartridge is suppressed.

      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Each of the five ink cartridges <b>12</b> contains any one of the yellow, magenta, cyan, black, and white inks. For example, the white ink is the pigment ink for ink-jet recording. As the other inks, general inks may be used. The ink-jet head <b>13</b> set in the head unit <b>14</b> performs recording on a recording medium (for example, recording paper) P. The five ink cartridges <b>12</b> and the head unit <b>14</b> are mounted in the carriage <b>15</b>. The drive unit <b>16</b> reciprocates the carriage <b>15</b> in a straight line direction. As the drive unit <b>16</b>, a conventionally known drive unit may be used, for example (for example, see JP 2008-246821 A). The platen roller <b>17</b> extends in a reciprocating direction of the carriage <b>15</b> and is arranged so as to be opposed to the ink-jet head <b>13</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The purge unit <b>18</b> draws poor inks containing air bubbles and the like trapped inside the ink-jet head <b>13</b>. As the purge unit <b>18</b>, a conventionally known purge unit may be used, for example (for example, see JP 2008-246821 A).</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">On the platen roller <b>17</b> side of the purge unit <b>18</b>, a wiper member <b>20</b> is arranged at a predetermined position so as to be adjacent to the purge unit <b>18</b>. The wiper member <b>20</b> is formed into a spatula shape and wipes a nozzle-formed surface of the ink-jet head <b>13</b> with the movement of the carriage <b>15</b>. In <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a cap <b>19</b> covers a plurality of nozzles of the ink-jet head <b>13</b>, which returns to the reset position after completion of the recording, in order to prevent the inks from drying.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The five ink cartridges <b>12</b> are mounted in one carriage <b>15</b> together with the head unit <b>14</b> in the ink-jet recording apparatus <b>10</b> of the present example. However, in the ink-jet recording apparatus <b>10</b>, each of the five ink cartridges <b>12</b> may be mounted in a carriage that is different from a carriage in which the head unit <b>14</b> is mounted. Each of the five ink cartridges <b>12</b> may not be mounted in the carriage <b>15</b> and may be arranged and fixed in the ink-jet recording apparatus <b>10</b>. In these aspects, for example, each of the five ink cartridges <b>12</b> and the head unit <b>14</b> mounted in the carriage <b>15</b> are linked via a tube or the like, and the ink is supplied from each of the five ink cartridges <b>12</b> to the head unit <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The ink-jet recording using this ink-jet recording apparatus <b>10</b> is performed as described below, for example.

Then, the recording paper P is introduced between the ink-jet head <b>13</b> and the platen roller <b>17</b>. Thereafter, the introduced recording paper P is subjected to the predetermined recording with inks ejected from the ink-jet head <b>13</b>. The pigment ink for ink-jet recording is superior in dispersibility. Thus, the user is not required to shake the ink cartridges <b>12</b> to stir the pigment ink for ink-jet recording. Moreover, by using the pigment ink for ink-jet recording, the deposition of the pigment in an ink flow path of the ink-jet recording apparatus <b>10</b> and the clogging of the ink-jet head <b>13</b> by the pigment are suppressed. The recording paper P after the recording is discharged from the ink-jet recording apparatus <b>10</b>. Mechanisms of feeding and discharging the recording paper P are omitted in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. The pigment ink for ink-jet recording is favorably used in formation of a white base layer at the time when a color recording is performed on a transparent sheet such as an OHP sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In the apparatus shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a serial-type ink-jet head is employed. However, in the ink-jet recording apparatus, a line-type ink jet head may be employed.</p>

      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">As a pigment for ink-jet recording, porous silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) particles coated with an inorganic pigment layer containing titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) were produced.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">That is, first, 5.0 g of calcium carbonate having a particle size of 500 nm was weighed, and 18.00 ml of distilled water and 150.00 ml of ethanol were added thereto. The resultant mixture was then stirred with ultrasound for 10 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">Then, 15.0 ml of 25% aqueous ammonia solution and 4.0 ml of TEOS were added to the obtained dispersion liquid of the calcium carbonate, and the resultant mixture was refluxed at 50Â° C. for 2 hours.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">Thereafter, the solution after the reflux was subjected to centrifugal separation, and the obtained precipitate was washed with ethanol. Then, the calcium carbonate was dissolved and removed with 3 mol/l hydrochloric acid. The precipitate was then again subjected to centrifugal separation, and the obtained precipitate was washed with ethanol and dried at 90Â° C. for 24 hours.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">Subsequently, 1.0 ml of distilled water, 40 ml of ethanol, and 0.066 g of polyvinyl pyrolidone were added to the obtained porous SiO<sub>2 </sub>particle, which was then stirred with ultrasound for 15 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">Then, 40 ml of ethanol and tetrabutoxy titanium (TBOT) were added to a dispersion liquid of the obtained porous SiO<sub>2 </sub>particle, which was then stirred with ultrasound for 1 hour. By changing the charge amount of TBOT relative to the porous SiO<sub>2 </sub>particle, the thickness of the TiO<sub>2 </sub>film (the thickness of the inorganic pigment layer) was controlled. By increasing the charge amount of TBOT, the thickness of the TiO<sub>2 </sub>film (the thickness of the inorganic pigment layer) is increased.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">Subsequently, the solution after the stirring with ultrasound was subjected to centrifugal separation, and the obtained precipitate was then washed with ethanol and thereafter dried at 90Â° C. for 24 hours. Thereafter, the precipitate was fired at 550Â° C. for 3 hours. Thus, porous SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles (pigments A to J) coated with an inorganic pigment layer containing TiO<sub>2 </sub>were obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">Various physical properties of the pigments A to J were measured by the following methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">Thickness of TiO<sub>2 </sub>film (Thickness of the inorganic pigment layer) The thickness of the TiO<sub>2 </sub>film was determined by actual measurement using a scanning electron microscope.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">Particle Size (Diameter)</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">The particle size was determined by dynamic light scattering using Microtrac UPA-EX150 manufactured by NIKKISO CO., LTD.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2 </sub>(Weight Ratio)</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">The SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2 </sub>was determined by actual measurement using a scanning electron microscope (EDS: energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry).</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">Density</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">The density was measured using Micro-Ultrapycnometer 1000 manufactured by Malvern.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">Sedimentation Velocity in Solvent</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">The sedimentation velocity in a solvent (water) was measured by centrifugal separation using LUMiSizer 610 manufactured by LUM.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">Brightness (L*)</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">10 wt % of any of the pigments A to J, 15 wt % of a binder resin (MOWINYL (registered trademark) 6960, manufactured by Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), 20 wt % of a humectant (glycerin), and 50 wt % of water were uniformly mixed. Thus, each paint was prepared. Subsequently, the paint was drawn down onto a PET (polyethylene terephthalate) film using a bar coater #5, and the brightness (L*) was measured using a colorimeter.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">The measurement results of various physical properties of the pigments A to J are summarized in Table 1.</p>

      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0091">As summarized in Table 1, as can be seen from the fact that the pigments A to J had low sedimentation velocities in a solvent compared with the comparative pigments having the same TiO<sub>2 </sub>film thicknesses and the same particle sizes as the pigments A to J, in which pore openings of the porous SiO<sub>2 </sub>particles were completely filled with TiO<sub>2</sub>, the pigments A to J are superior in dispersibility in a solvent. Specifically, as can be seen from the fact that the pigments B to G having densities of 1.7 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 2.8 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>had the sedimentation velocities of about Â½ or less, compared with the comparative pigments, the pigments B to G are more superior in dispersibility in a solvent. Moreover, as can be seen from the fact that the pigments B to G had L* of about 60 or more, the pigments B to G are more superior in also brightness.</p>
