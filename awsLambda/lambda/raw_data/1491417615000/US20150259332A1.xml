      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present disclosure concerns compounds and methods for their use in modulation of the JAK pathway, inhibition of one or more JAK kinases and in the treatment of conditions in which modulation of the JAK pathway or inhibition of JAK kinases, particularly JAK3, is therapeutically useful.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Background</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">JAnus Kinases (or JAK) are a family of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Each of the JAK kinases is selective for the receptors of certain cytokines, though multiple JAK kinases can be affected by particular cytokine or signaling pathways. Studies suggest that JAK3 associates with the common gamma chain (Î³c) of the various cytokine receptors. In particular, JAK3 selectively binds to receptors and is part of the cytokine signaling pathway for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. The kinase JAK1 interacts with, among others, the receptors for cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-21, while JAK2 interacts with, among others, the receptors for IL-9 and TNF-Î±. Upon the binding of certain cytokines to their receptors (for example, IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21), receptor oligomerization occurs, resulting in the cytoplasmic tails of associated JAK kinases being brought into proximity and facilitating the trans-phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the JAK kinase. This trans-phosphorylation results in the activation of the JAK kinase.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Phosphorylated JAK kinases bind various Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) proteins. These STAT proteins, which are DNA binding proteins activated by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, function both as signaling molecules and transcription factors and ultimately bind to specific DNA sequences present in the promoters of cytokine-responsive genes (Leonard et al., (2000), <i>J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. </i>105:877-888). Signaling of JAK/STAT has been implicated in the mediation of many abnormal immune responses such as allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases such as transplant (allograft) rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, as well as in solid and hematologic malignancies such as leukemia and lymphomas. For a review of the pharmaceutical intervention of the JAK/STAT pathway see Frank, (1999), <i>Mol. Med. </i>5:432:456 and Seidel et al., (2000), <i>Oncogene </i>19:2645-2656.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In particular, JAK3 has been implicated in a variety of biological processes. For example, the proliferation and survival of murine mast cells induced by IL-4 and IL-9 have been shown to be dependent on JAK3- and gamma chain-signaling (Suzuki et al., (2000), <i>Blood </i>96:2172-2180). Having a crucial role in IgE receptor-mediated mast cell degranulation responses (Malaviya et al., (1999), <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </i>257:807-813), inhibition of JAK3 kinase has been shown to prevent type I hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis (Malaviya et al., (1999), <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>274:27028-27038). JAK3 inhibition has also been shown to result in immune suppression for allograft rejection (Kirken, (2001), <i>Transpl. Proc. </i>33:3268-3270). Kinases, particularly JAK3 kinases, have also been implicated in the mechanism involved in early and late stages of rheumatoid arthritis (Muller-Ladner et al., (2000), <i>J. Immunol. </i>164:3894-3901); familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Trieu et al., (2000), <i>Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. </i>267:22-25); leukemia (Sudbeck et al., (1999), <i>Clin. Cancer Res. </i>5:1569-1582); mycosis fungoides, a form of T-cell lymphoma (Nielsen et al., (1997), <i>Prac. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>94:6764-6769); and abnormal cell growth (Yu et al., (1997), <i>J. Immunol. </i>159:5206-5210; Catlett-Falcone et al., (1999), <i>Immunity </i>10:105-115).</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The JAK kinases, including JAK3, are abundantly expressed in primary leukemic cells from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood cancer, and studies have correlated STAT activation in certain cells with signals regulating apoptosis (Demoulin et al., (1996), <i>Mol. Cell. Biol. </i>16:4710-6; Jurlander et al., (1997), <i>Blood. </i>89:4146-52; Kaneko et al., (1997), <i>Clin. Exp. Immun. </i>109:185-193; and Nakamura et al., (1996), <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>271:19483-8). They are also known to be important to lymphocyte differentiation, function and survival. In particular, JAK3 plays an essential role in the function of lymphocytes, macrophages, and mast cells. Given the importance of JAK kinases, particularly JAK3, compounds which modulate the JAK pathway, including those selective for JAK3, can be useful for treating diseases or conditions where the function of lymphocytes, macrophages, or mast cells is involved (Kudlacz et al., (2004) <i>Am. J. Transplant </i>4:51-57; Changelian (2003) <i>Science </i>302:875-878). Conditions in which targeting of the JAK pathway or modulation of the JAK kinases, particularly JAK3, are contemplated to be therapeutically useful include, leukemia, lymphoma, transplant rejection (for example, pancreas islet transplant rejection, bone marrow transplant applications (for example, graft-versus-host disease), autoimmune diseases (for example, diabetes), and inflammation (for example, asthma, allergic reactions). Conditions which can benefit for inhibition of JAK3 are discussed in greater detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In view of the numerous conditions that are contemplated to benefit by treatment involving modulation of the JAK pathway it is immediately apparent that new compounds that modulate JAK pathways and methods of using these compounds should provide substantial therapeutic benefits to a wide variety of patients. Provided herein are novel 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds for use in the treatment of conditions in which targeting of the JAK pathway or inhibition of JAK kinases, particularly JAK3, are therapeutically useful.</p>

      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0053">When chemical structures are depicted or described, unless explicitly stated otherwise, all carbons are assumed to have hydrogen substitution to conform to a valence of four. For example, in the structure on the left-hand side of the schematic below there are nine hydrogens implied. The nine hydrogens are depicted in the right-hand structure. Sometimes a particular atom in a structure is described in textual formula as having a hydrogen or hydrogens as substitution (expressly defined hydrogen), for example, âCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>â. It would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the aforementioned descriptive techniques are common in the chemical arts to provide brevity and simplicity to description of otherwise complex structures.</p>

      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0058">âAlkylâ in its broadest sense is intended to include linear, branched, or cyclic hydrocarbon structures, and combinations thereof. Alkyl groups can be fully saturated or with one or more units of unsaturation, but not aromatic. Generally alkyl groups are defined by a subscript, either a fixed integer or a range of integers. For example, âC<sub>8</sub>alkylâ includes n-octyl, iso-octyl, 3-octynyl, cyclohexenylethyl, cyclohexylethyl, and the like; where the subscript â8â designates that all groups defined by this term have a fixed carbon number of eight. In another example, the term âC<sub>1-6 </sub>alkylâ refers to alkyl groups having from one to six carbon atoms and, depending on any unsaturation, branches and/or rings, the requisite number of hydrogens. Examples of C<sub>1-6 </sub>alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, vinyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, s-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, isobutenyl, pentyl, pentynyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl, hexenyl, and the like. When an alkyl residue having a specific number of carbons is named generically, all geometric isomers having that number of carbons are intended to be encompassed. For example, either âpropylâ or âC<sub>3</sub>alkylâ each include n-propyl, c-propyl, propenyl, propynyl, and isopropyl. Cycloalkyl is a subset of alkyl and includes cyclic hydrocarbon groups of from three to thirteen carbon atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl groups include c-propyl, c-butyl, c-pentyl, norbornyl, norbornenyl, c-hexenyl, adamantyl and the like. As mentioned, alkyl refers to alkanyl, alkenyl, and alkynyl residues (and combinations thereof)âit is intended to include, for example, cyclohexylmethyl, vinyl, allyl, isoprenyl, and the like. An alkyl with a particular number of carbons can be named using a more specific but still generic geometrical constraint, for example âC<sub>3-6</sub>cycloalkylâ which means only cycloalkyls having between 3 and 6 carbons are meant to be included in that particular definition. Unless specified otherwise, alkyl groups, whether alone or part of another group, for example âC(O)alkyl, have from one to twenty carbons, that is C<sub>1-20</sub>alkyl. In the example ââC(O)alkyl,â where there were no carbon count limitations defined, the carbonyl of the âC(O)alkyl group is not included in the carbon count, since âalkylâ is designated generically. But where a specific carbon limitation is given, for example in the term âoptionally substituted C<sub>1-20</sub>alkyl,â where the optional substitution includes âoxoâ the carbon of any carbonyls formed by such âoxoâ substitution are included in the carbon count since they were part of the original carbon count limitation. However, again referring to âoptionally substituted C<sub>1-20</sub>alkyl,â if optional substitution includes carbon-containing groups, for example âCH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H, the two carbons in this group are not included in the C<sub>1-20</sub>alkyl carbon limitation.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0059">When a carbon number limit is given at the beginning of a term which itself comprises two terms, the carbon number limitation is understood as inclusive for both terms. For example, for the term âC<sub>7-14 </sub>arylalkyl,â both the âarylâ and the âalkylâ portions of the term are included the carbon count, a maximum of 14 in this example, but additional substituent groups thereon are not included in the atom count unless they incorporate a carbon from the group's designated carbon count, as in the âoxoâ example above. Likewise when an atom number limit is given, for example â6-14 membered heteroarylalkyl,â both the âheteroarylâ and the âalkylâ portion are included the atom count limitation, but additional substituent groups thereon are not included in the atom count unless they incorporate a carbon from the group's designated carbon count. In another example, âC<sub>4-10</sub>cycloalkylalkylâ means a cycloalkyl bonded to the parent structure via an alkylene, alkylidene or alkylidyne; in this example the group is limited to 10 carbons inclusive of the alkylene, alkylidene or alkylidyne subunit. As another example, the âalkylâ portion of, for example âC<sub>7-14 </sub>arylalkylâ is meant to include alkylene, alkylidene or alkylidyne, unless stated otherwise, for example as in the terms âC<sub>7-14 </sub>arylalkyleneâ or âC<sub>6-10</sub>aryl-CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>â.â</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0060">âAlkyleneâ refers to straight, branched and cyclic (and combinations thereof) divalent radical consisting solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms, containing no unsaturation and having from one to ten carbon atoms, for example, methylene, ethylene, propylene, n-butylene and the like. Alkylene is like alkyl, referring to the same residues as alkyl, but having two points of attachment and, specifically, fully saturated. Examples of alkylene include ethylene (âCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>â), propylene (âCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>â), dimethylpropylene (âCH<sub>2</sub>C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>â), cyclohexan-1,4-diyl and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0061">âAlkylideneâ refers to straight, branched and cyclic (and combinations thereof) unsaturated divalent radical consisting solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms, having from two to ten carbon atoms, for example, ethylidene, propylidene, n-butylidene, and the like. Alkylidene is like alkyl, referring to the same residues as alkyl, but having two points of attachment and, specifically, at least one unit of double bond unsaturation. Examples of alkylidene include vinylidene (âCHâCHâ), cyclohexylvinylidene (âCHâC(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>13</sub>)â), cyclohexen-1,4-diyl and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0062">âAlkylidyneâ refers to straight, branched and cyclic (and combinations thereof) unsaturated divalent radical consisting solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms having from two to ten carbon atoms, for example, propylid-2-ynyl, n-butylid-1-ynyl, and the like. Alkylidyne is like alkyl, referring to the same residues as alkyl, but having two points of attachment and, specifically, at least one unit of triple bond unsaturation.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0063">Any of the above radicalsâ âalkylene,â âalkylideneâ and âalkylidyne,â when optionally substituted, can contain alkyl substitution which itself can contain unsaturation. For example, 2-(2-phenylethynyl-but-3-enyl)-naphthalene (IUPAC name) contains an n-butylid-3-ynyl radical with a vinyl substituent at the 2-position of the radical. Combinations of alkyls and carbon-containing substitutions thereon are limited to thirty carbon atoms.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0064">âAlkoxyâ refers to the group âO-alkyl, where alkyl is as defined herein. Alkoxy includes, by way of example, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, t-butoxy, sec-butoxy, n-pentoxy, cyclohexyloxy, cyclohexenyloxy, cyclopropylmethyloxy, and the like.</p>

If any aromatic ring portion contains a heteroatom, the group is a heteroaryl and not an aryl. Aryl groups are monocyclic, bicyclic, tricyclic or tetracyclic.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0071">âAryleneâ refers to an aryl that has at least two groups attached thereto. For a more specific example, âphenyleneâ refers to a divalent phenyl ring radical. A phenylene, thus can have more than two groups attached, but is defined by a minimum of two non-hydrogen groups attached thereto.</p>

Examples include benzyl, phenethyl, phenylvinyl, phenylallyl and the like. When specified as âoptionally substituted,â both the aryl, and the corresponding alkylene, alkylidene, or alkylidyne portion of an arylalkyl group can be optionally substituted.

For purposes of this invention, the heterocyclyl radical can be a monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic ring system, which can include fused or bridged ring systems as well as spirocyclic systems; and the nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon or sulfur atoms in the heterocyclyl radical can be optionally oxidized to various oxidation states. In a specific example, the group âS(O)<sub>0-2</sub>â, refers to âSâ (sulfide), âS(O)â (sulfoxide), and âSO<sub>2</sub>â (sulfone) linkages. For convenience, nitrogens, particularly but not exclusively, those defined as annular aromatic nitrogens, are meant to include their corresponding N-oxide form, although not explicitly defined as such in a particular example. Thus, for a compound having, for example, a pyridyl ring; the corresponding pyridyl-N-oxide is meant to be included in the presently disclosed compounds. In addition, annular nitrogen atoms can be optionally quaternized. âHeterocycleâ includes heteroaryl and heteroalicyclyl, that is a heterocyclic ring can be partially or fully saturated or aromatic. Thus a term such as âheterocyclylalkylâ includes heteroalicyclylalkyls and heteroarylalkyls. Examples of heterocyclyl radicals include, but are not limited to, azetidinyl, acridinyl, benzodioxolyl, benzodioxanyl, benzofuranyl, carbazoyl, cinnolinyl, dioxolanyl, indolizinyl, naphthyridinyl, perhydroazepinyl, phenazinyl, phenothiazinyl, phenoxazinyl, phthalazinyl, pteridinyl, purinyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, tetrazoyl, tetrahydroisoquinolyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, 2-oxopiperazinyl, 2-oxopiperidinyl, 2-oxopyrrolidinyl, 2-oxoazepinyl, azepinyl, pyrrolyl, 4-piperidonyl, pyrrolidinyl, pyrazolyl, pyrazolidinyl, imidazolyl, imidazolinyl, imidazolidinyl, dihydropyridinyl, tetrahydropyridinyl, pyridinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, oxazolyl, oxazolinyl, oxazolidinyl, triazolyl, isoxazolyl, isoxazolidinyl, morpholinyl, thiazolyl, thiazolinyl, thiazolidinyl, isothiazolyl, quinuclidinyl, isothiazolidinyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, indolinyl, isoindolinyl, octahydroindolyl, octahydroisoindolyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, decahydroisoquinolyl, benzimidazolyl, thiadiazolyl, benzopyranyl, benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, furyl, diazabicycloheptane, diazapane, diazepine, tetrahydrofuryl, tetrahydropyranyl, thienyl, benzothieliyl, thiamorpholinyl, thiamorpholinyl sulfoxide, thiamorpholinyl sulfone, dioxaphospholanyl, and oxadiazolyl.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0087">âHeteroarylâ refers to an aromatic group having from 1 to 10 annular carbon atoms and 1 to 4 annular heteroatoms. Heteroaryl groups have at least one aromatic ring component, but heteroaryls can be fully unsaturated or partially unsaturated. If any aromatic ring in the group has a heteroatom, then the group is a heteroaryl, even, for example, if other aromatic rings in the group have no heteroatoms. For example, 2H-pyrido[3,2-b][1,4]oxazin-3(4H)-one-7-yl, indolyl and benzimidazolyl are âheteroaryls.â Heteroaryl groups can have a single ring (for example, pyridinyl, imidazolyl or furyl) or multiple condensed rings (for example, indolizinyl, quinolinyl, benzimidazolyl or benzothienyl), where the condensed rings may or may not be aromatic and/or contain a heteroatom, provided that the point of attachment to the parent molecule is through an atom of the aromatic portion of the heteroaryl group. In one embodiment, the nitrogen and/or sulfur ring atom(s) of the heteroaryl group are optionally oxidized to provide for the N-oxide (NâO), sulfinyl, or sulfonyl moieties. Compounds described herein containing phosphorous, in a heterocyclic ring or not, include the oxidized forms of phosphorous. Heteroaryl groups are monocyclic, bicyclic, tricyclic or tetracyclic.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0088">âHeteroaryloxyâ refers to âO-heteroaryl.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0089">âHeteroaryleneâ generically refers to any heteroaryl that has at least two groups attached thereto. For a more specific example, âpyridyleneâ refers to a divalent pyridyl ring radical. A pyridylene, thus can have more than two groups attached, but is defined by a minimum of two non-hydrogen groups attached thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0090">âHeteroalicyclicâ refers specifically to a non-aromatic heterocyclyl radical. A heteroalicyclic may contain unsaturation, but is not aromatic. As mentioned, aryls and heteroaryls are attached to the parent structure via an aromatic ring. So, for example, 2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one-4-yl is a heteroalicyclic, while 2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one-7-yl is an aryl. In another example, 2H-pyrido[3,2-b][1,4]oxazin-3(4H)-one-4-yl is a heteroalicyclic, while 2H-pyrido[3,2-b][1,4]oxazin-3(4H)-one-7-yl is a heteroaryl.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0091">âHeterocyclylalkylâ refers to a heterocyclyl group linked to the parent structure via e.g. an alkylene linker. By way of example, the term âC<sub>5-14</sub>heterocyclylalkylâ includes groups such as (tetrahydrofuran-3-yl)methyl-, (pyridin-4-yl)methyl and 4-(morpholin-4-yl)butan-2-yl, depicted below.</p>

      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0097">When a group with its bonding structure is denoted as being bonded to two partners; that is, a divalent radical, for example, âOCH<sub>2</sub>â, then it is understood that either of the two partners can be bound to the particular group at one end, and the other partner is necessarily bound to the other end of the divalent group, unless stated explicitly otherwise. Stated another way, divalent radicals are not to be construed as limited to the depicted orientation, for example ââOCH<sub>2</sub>ââ is meant to mean not only ââOCH<sub>2</sub>ââ as drawn, but also ââCH<sub>2</sub>Oâ.â</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0098">âOptionalâ or âoptionallyâ means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that, with respect to any molecule described as containing one or more optional substituents, that only synthetically feasible compounds are meant to be included. âOptionally substitutedâ refers to all subsequent modifiers in a term, for example in the term âoptionally substituted arylC<sub>1-8</sub>alkyl,â optional substitution may occur on both the âC<sub>1-8</sub>alkylâ portion and the âarylâ portion of the arylC<sub>1-8</sub>alkyl group. Also by way of example, optionally substituted alkyl includes optionally substituted cycloalkyl groups. The term âsubstituted,â when used to modify a specified group or radical, means that one or more hydrogen atoms of the specified group or radical are each, independently of one another, replaced with the same or different substituent groups as defined below. Thus, when a group is defined as âoptionally substitutedâ the definition is meant to encompass when the groups is substituted with one or more of the radicals defined below, and when it is not so substituted.</p>

Stereoisomers include cis-trans isomers, E and Z isomers, enantiomers and diastereomers. Compounds as described herein, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that can be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)â or (S)â or, as (D)- or (L)- for amino acids. The present invention is meant to include all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms. Optically active (+) and (â), (R)â and (S)â, or (D)- and (L)- isomers can be prepared using chiral synthons, chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques, such as by: formation of diastereoisomeric salts or complexes which can be separated, for example, by crystallization; via formation of diastereoisomeric derivatives which can be separated, for example, by crystallization, selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer-specific reagent, for example enzymatic oxidation or reduction, followed by separation of the modified and unmodified enantiomers; or gas-liquid or liquid chromatography in a chiral environment, for example on a chiral support, such as silica with a bound chiral ligand or in the presence of a chiral solvent. It will be appreciated that where a desired enantiomer is converted into another chemical entity by one of the separation procedures described above, a further step may be required to liberate the desired enantiomeric form. Alternatively, specific enantiomer can be synthesized by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting on enantiomer to the other by asymmetric transformation.

      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0114">âPatientâ or âSubjectâ refers to mammals and other animals, particularly humans. Thus the methods are applicable to both human therapy and veterinary applications. In one embodiment the patient or subject is a mammal. In another embodiment the patient or subject is a human.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0115">âPharmaceutically acceptable saltâ refers to pharmaceutically acceptable salts of a compound, which salts are derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art and include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and the like; and when the molecule contains a basic functionality, salts of organic or inorganic acids, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, tartrate, mesylate, acetate, maleate, oxalate, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are those salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the free bases while formed by acid partners that are not biologically or otherwise undesirable, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, as well as organic acids such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, benzene sulfonic acid, salicylic acid, xinafoic acid (1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid), pamoic acid (also called embonic acid or 4,4â²-methylenebis(3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid) and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include those derived from inorganic bases such as sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum salts and the like. Exemplary salts are the ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts. Salts of the presently disclosed compounds can be derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include, but are not limited to, salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, ethanolamine, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-diol (âTrisâ salt), dicyclohexylamine, lysine, arginine, histidine, caffeine, procaine, hydrabamine, choline, betaine, ethylenediamine, glucosamine, methylglucamine, theobromine, purines, piperazine, piperidine, N-ethylpiperidine, polyamine resins, and the like (See, for example, S. M. Berge, et al., âPharmaceutical Salts,â J. Pharm. Sci., 1977; 66:1-19 which is incorporated herein by reference.)</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0116">âPharmaceutically effective amountâ and âtherapeutically effective amountâ refer to an amount of a compound sufficient to treat a specified disorder or disease or one or more of its symptoms and/or to prevent the occurrence of the disease or disorder. The amount of a compound which constitutes a âtherapeutically effective amountâ will vary depending on the compound, the disease state and its severity, the age of the patient to be treated, and the like. The therapeutically effective amount can be determined routinely by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0117">âProdrugâ refers to compounds that are transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound, for example, by hydrolysis in the gut or enzymatic conversion in blood. Common examples include, but are not limited to, ester and amide forms of a compound having an active form bearing a carboxylic acid moiety. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable esters of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, alkyl esters (for example with between about one and about six carbons) where the alkyl group is a straight or branched chain. Acceptable esters also include cycloalkyl esters and arylalkyl esters such as, but not limited to benzyl. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable amides of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, primary amides, and secondary and tertiary alkyl amides (for example with between about one and about six carbons). Amides and esters of the compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to conventional methods. A thorough discussion of prodrugs is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, âPro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,â Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0118">âMetaboliteâ refers to the break-down or end product of a compound or its salt produced by metabolism or biotransformation in the animal or human body; for example, biotransformation to a more polar molecule such as by oxidation, reduction, or hydrolysis, or to a conjugate (see Goodman and Gilman, âThe Pharmacological Basis of Therapeuticsâ 8<sup>th </sup>Ed., Pergamon Press, Gilman et al. (eds), 1990 which is herein incorporated by reference). The metabolite of a compound described herein or its salt can itself be a biologically active compound in the body. While a prodrug described herein would meet this criteria, that is, form a described biologically active parent compound in vivo, âmetaboliteâ is meant to encompass those compounds not contemplated to have lost a progroup, but rather all other compounds that are formed in vivo upon administration of a compound as described herein which retain the biological activities described herein. Thus one aspect disclosed 2,4-pyrimidine diamine compounds specifically contemplated herein is a metabolite of a compound described herein. For example, a biologically active metabolite is discovered serendipitously, that is, no prodrug design per se was undertaken. Stated another way, biologically active compounds inherently formed as a result of practicing methods as described herein, are contemplated and disclosed herein. âSolvateâ refers to a complex formed by combination of solvent molecules with molecules or ions of the solute. The solvent can be an organic compound, an inorganic compound, or a mixture of both. Some examples of solvents include, but are not limited to, methanol, N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfoxide, and water. The compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with solvents, pharmaceutically acceptable or not, such as water, ethanol, and the like. Solvated forms of the presently disclosed compounds are contemplated herein and are encompassed by the invention, at least in generic terms.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0119">âTreatingâ or âtreatmentâ as used herein covers the treatment of the disease or condition of interest in a mammal, preferably a human, having the disease or condition of interest, and includes:</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0120">(i) preventing the disease or condition from occurring in a mammal, in particular, when such mammal is predisposed to the condition but has not yet been diagnosed as having it;</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0121">(ii) inhibiting the disease or condition, for example, arresting or slowing its development;</p>

      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0124">As used herein, the terms âdiseaseâ and âconditionâ can be used interchangeably or can be different in that the particular malady or condition may not have a known causative agent (so that etiology has not yet been worked out) and it is therefore not yet recognized as a disease but only as an undesirable condition or syndrome, where a more or less specific set of symptoms have been identified by clinicians.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0125">Similarly, it is understood that the above definitions are not intended to include impermissible substitution patterns (for example, methyl substituted with 5 fluoro groups). Such impermissible substitution patterns are easily recognized by a person having ordinary skill in the art.</p>

A water-solubilizing group is a group that has hydrophilic character sufficient to improve or increase the water-solubility of the compound in which it is included, as compared to an analog compound that does not include the group. The hydrophilic character can be achieved by, for example, the inclusion of functional groups that ionize under the conditions of use to form charged moieties (for example, carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids and salts, phosphoric acids and salts, amines, etc.); groups that include permanent charges (for example, quaternary ammonium groups); and/or heteroatoms or heteroatomic groups.

More specific examples include âOâC<sub>1-6</sub>alkylene-R<sup>b</sup>, âSâC<sub>1-6 </sub>alkylene-R<sup>b</sup>, âOâC<sub>1-6 </sub>alkylene-R<sup>a </sup>where R<sup>a </sup>is heterocyclyl, âN(R<sup>a</sup>)âC<sub>1-6</sub>alkylene-R<sup>b</sup>, âOâC<sub>1-6</sub>alkylene-CH((CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>1-2</sub>R<sup>b</sup>)R<sup>b</sup>, âC(O)N(R<sup>a</sup>)âC<sub>1-6</sub>alkylene-R<sup>b </sup>and âN((C(R<sup>a</sup>)<sub>2</sub>)<sub>1-3</sub>R<sup>b</sup>)<sub>2</sub>.

In another specific example, in accord with the formula given above for water-solubilizing groups, the water-solubilizing group is an amino acid tethered from the molecule via a bond to the nitrogen of the amino acid. In a more specific example, a water-solubilizing group is an Î±-amino acid or derivative thereof attached to the parent ring, e.g. ring A and/or at Z<sup>1 </sup>or Z<sup>2</sup>, via the nitrogen of the Î±-amino acid, for example âN(H)C(R<sup>a</sup>)<sub>2</sub>âR<sup>b</sup>, where R<sup>b </sup>is âCO<sub>2</sub>R<sup>a </sup>or âC(O)N(R<sup>c</sup>)<sub>2</sub>. In another specific embodiment, the water-solubilizing group is morpholino, piperidinyl, NâC<sub>1-6 </sub>alkyl piperidinyl, piperazinyl, NâC<sub>1-6 </sub>alkyl piperazinyl, pyrrolidinyl, NâC<sub>1-6 </sub>alkyl pyrrolidinyl, diazepinyl, NâC<sub>1-6 </sub>alkyl azepinyl, homopiperazinyl, NâC<sub>1-6 </sub>alkyl homopiperazinyl, imidazoyl, and the like. In another example the water-solubilizing group is one of the aforementioned rings tethered to the parent molecule via an alkylene, alkylidene, alkylidyne linker. In a more specific embodiment, the water-solubilizing group is one of the aforementioned rings tethered to the parent molecule via a C<sub>1-6 </sub>alkylene, where one or two of the alkylene carbons is, independently, replaced with one of O, S or NH, but not where any two of the aforementioned heteroatoms are contiguous in the linker. Other water solubilizing groups are well-known and include, by way of example, hydrophilic groups such as alkyl or heteroalicyclyl groups substituted with one or more of an amine, alcohol, a carboxylic acid, a phosphorous acid, a sulfoxide, a carbohydrate, a sugar alcohol, an amino acid, a thiol, a polyol, an ether, a thioether, and a quaternary amine salt.</p>

      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0161">Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds described herein can include functional groups that can be masked with progroups to create prodrugs. Such prodrugs are usually, but need not be, pharmacologically inactive until converted into their active drug form. Indeed, many of the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds described in this invention include promoieties that are hydrolyzable or otherwise cleavable under conditions of use. For example, ester groups commonly undergo acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to yield the parent carboxylic acid when exposed to the acidic conditions of the stomach or base-catalyzed hydrolysis when exposed to the basic conditions of the intestine or blood. Thus, when administered to a subject orally, 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds that include ester moieties can be considered prodrugs of their corresponding carboxylic acid, regardless of whether the ester form is pharmacologically active.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0162">The mechanism by which the progroup(s) metabolizes is not critical and can be caused, for example, by hydrolysis under the acidic conditions of the stomach, as described above, and/or by enzymes present in the digestive tract and/or tissues or organs of the body. Indeed, the progroup(s) can be selected to metabolize at a particular site within the body. For example, many esters are cleaved under the acidic conditions found in the stomach. Prodrugs designed to cleave chemically in the stomach to the active 2,4-pyrimidinediamine can employ progroups including such esters. Alternatively, the progroups can be designed to metabolize in the presence of enzymes such as esterases, amidases, lipolases, and phosphatases, including ATPases and kinase, etc. Progroups including linkages capable of metabolizing in vivo are well known and include, by way of example and not limitation, ethers, thioethers, silylethers, silylthioethers, esters, thioesters, carbonates, thiocarbonates, carbamates, thiocarbamates, ureas, thioureas, and carboxamides. In some instances, a âprecursorâ group that is oxidized by oxidative enzymes such as, for example, cytochrome P<sub>450 </sub>of the liver, to a metabolizable group, can be selected.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0163">In the prodrugs, any available functional moiety can be masked with a progroup to yield a prodrug. Functional groups within the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds that can be masked with progroups for inclusion in a promoiety include, but are not limited to, amines (primary and secondary), hydroxyls, sulfanyls (thiols), and carboxyls. A wide variety of progroups, as well as the resultant promoieties, suitable for masking functional groups in active 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds to yield prodrugs are well-known in the art. For example, a hydroxyl functional group can be masked as a sulfonate, ester, or carbonate promoiety, which can be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the hydroxyl group. An amino functional group can be masked as an amide, carbamate, imine, urea, phosphenyl, phosphoryl, or sulfenyl promoiety, which can be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the amino group. A carboxyl group can be masked as an ester (including silyl esters and thioesters), amide, or hydrazide promoiety, which can be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the carboxyl group. Other specific examples of suitable progroups and their respective promoieties will be apparent to those of skill in the art. All of these progroups, alone or in combinations, can be included in the prodrugs.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0164">In some embodiments of the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds and methods of using the compounds, the progroup(s) can be attached to any available primary or secondary amine, including, for example, the N2 nitrogen atom of the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine, the N4 nitrogen atom of the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine, and/or a primary or secondary nitrogen atom included in a substituent on the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0165">As noted above, the identity of the progroup is not critical, provided that it can be metabolized under the desired conditions of use, for example, under the acidic conditions found in the stomach and/or by enzymes found in vivo, to yield a biologically active group, for example, the 2,4-pyrimidinediamines as described herein. Thus, skilled artisans will appreciate that the progroup can include virtually any known or later-discovered hydroxyl, amine or thiol protecting group. Non-limiting examples of suitable protecting groups can be found, for example, in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene &amp; Wuts, 2<sup>nd </sup>Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1991 (especially pages 10-142 (alcohols, 277-308 (thiols) and 309-405 (amines) the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, herein referred to as â<i>Green </i>&amp; <i>Wuts</i>â).</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0166">A particularly useful progroup employed in exemplary disclosed compounds is âCH<sub>2</sub>OP(OH)<sub>2 </sub>as well as esters, mixed acid esters and salts thereof. In some embodiments, the âCH<sub>2</sub>OP(OH)<sub>2 </sub>progroup is attached via a nitrogen atom, annular or not, of the parent molecule. There can be more than one such progroup. Thus, one embodiment is a compound of formula I,</p>

      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0171">While not intending to be bound by any particular theory of operation, it is believed that progroups âCH<sub>2</sub>OP(O)(OR<sup>11</sup>)<sub>2</sub>, e.g. according to formula IV, metabolize to active compounds via the corresponding hydroxymethylamine intermediate illustrated below:</p>

      </p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0172">Such hydroxymethylamine compounds, although typically isolable under controlled conditions, are known to be unstable under physiological conditions and various pH ranges where they hydrolyze in vivo to yield formaldehyde and the active drug substance. Based on this observation, compounds as described herein include hydroxymethyl progroups that can be metabolized in vivo, for example by the acidic conditions of the stomach and/or by enzymes present in the digestive tract or other organs and/or tissues or fluids with the body, to yield the active drug substance 2,4-pyrimidinediamine.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0173">Moreover, it is expected that the amino and thio analogs of these hydroxymethylamines, will be similarly unstable at physiological conditions and also hydrolyze in vivo to the active 2,4-pyrimidinediamine drug. Accordingly, compounds as described herein include these corresponding primary amino and thiol compounds. Also, the invention includes compounds in which the primary amine, thiol and hydroxy groups are masked with âprotectingâ groups that are removed under physiological conditions of use to yield the corresponding hydroxymethyl, thiolmethyl and aminomethyl compounds, that is, with these âprotecting groupsâ these compounds will likewise make suitable prodrugs.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0174">Suitability of any particular progroup for a desired mode of administration can be confirmed in biochemical assays. For example, if a prodrug is to be administered by injection into a particular tissue or organ and the identities of the various enzyme(s) expressed in the tissue or organ are known, the particular prodrug can be tested for metabolism in biochemical assays with the isolated enzyme(s). Alternatively, the particular prodrug can be tested for metabolism to the active 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compound with tissue and/or organ extracts. Using tissue and/or organ extracts can be of particular convenience when the identity(ies) of the enzymes expressed in the target tissues or organs are unknown or in instances when the isolated enzymes are not conveniently available. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to readily select progroups having metabolic properties (such as kinetics) suitable for particular applications using such in vitro tests. Specific prodrugs could also be tested for suitable metabolism in vitro animal models.</p>

      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0177">One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that compounds as described herein may exhibit the phenomena of tautomerism, conformational isomerism, geometric isomerism, and/or optical isomerism. For example, the compounds and prodrugs as described herein can include one or more chiral centers and/or double bonds and as a consequence can exist as stereoisomers, such as double-bond isomers (such as, geometric isomers), enantiomers, diasteromers, and mixtures thereof, such as racemic mixtures. As another example, the compounds as described herein can exist in several tautomeric forms, including the enol form, the keto form, and mixtures thereof. As the various compound names, formulae and compound drawings within the specification and claims can represent only one of the possible tautomeric, conformational isomeric, optical isomeric, or geometric isomeric forms, it would be understood that the invention encompasses any tautomeric, conformational isomeric, optical isomeric, and/or geometric isomeric forms of the compounds described herein, as well as mixtures of these various different isomeric forms. In cases of limited rotation, for example around the 2,4-pryimidinediamine core structure, atropisomers are also possible and are also specifically included in the compounds as described herein.

For example hydrogen occurs as protium (<sup>1</sup>H), deuterium (<sup>2</sup>H) and tritium (<sup>3</sup>H), and carbon occurs naturally as three different isotopes, <sup>12</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>14</sup>C. Thus the presently disclosed formulas include compounds having one or more different isotopic forms of certain elements, including hydrogen and carbon. A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any atom at any position of the disclosed compounds may be isotopically enriched, labeled with at least one isotope, or combinations thereof, with any isotope currently known or discovered in the future. Particular examples of isotopes include isotopes of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, halogens (e.g. chlorine, fluorine, bromine, and iodine), and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the presently disclosed compounds are provided in isotopically enriched form. In particular examples, compounds of formula I are enriched in deuterium relative to protium. In one embodiment, one or more groups appended to ring A have deuterium rather than H. In another embodiment, an alkyl group at R<sup>5 </sup>has deuterium rather than H. Deuterium has a natural abundance of about 0.015%. Accordingly, for approximately every 6,500 hydrogen atoms occurring in nature, there is one deuterium atom. Disclosed herein are compounds enriched in deuterium at one or more positions. Thus, deuterium containing compounds of the disclosure have deuterium at one or more positions (as the case may be) in an abundance of greater than 0.015%.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0179">In one embodiment, a compound of formula (I), at a position designated as having deuterium, has a minimum isotopic enrichment factor of at least 2000 (30% deuterium incorporation) at each atom designated as deuterium in the compound, or at least 3000 (45% deuterium incorporation).</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0180">In other embodiments, a compound of formula (I) has an isotopic enrichment factor for each designated deuterium atom of at least 3500 (52.5% deuterium incorporation at each designated deuterium atom), at least 4000 (60% deuterium incorporation), at least 4500 (67.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 5000 (75% deuterium incorporation), at least 5500 (82.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 6000 (90% deuterium incorporation), at least 6333.3 (95% deuterium incorporation), at least 6466.7 (97% deuterium incorporation), at least 6600 (99% deuterium incorporation), or at least 6633.3 (99.5% deuterium incorporation).</p>

      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0189">For topical administration, the JAK-selective compound(s) or prodrug(s) can be formulated as solutions, gels, ointments, creams, suspensions, etc., as are well-known in the art. Such formulations can be included in a patch or other transdermal delivery system or formulation, for example, a formulation with ingredients specifically designed to aid transport of the compound through the skin and into the body tissues.</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0190">Systemic formulations include those designed for administration by injection (for example, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, or intraperitoneal injection) as well as those designed for transdermal, transmucosal, oral, or pulmonary administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0191">Useful injectable preparations include sterile suspensions, solutions, or emulsions of the active compound(s) in aqueous or oily vehicles. The compositions can also contain formulating agents, such as suspending, stabilizing, and/or dispersing agents. The formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage form, for example, in ampules or in multidose containers, and can contain added preservatives.</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0192">Alternatively, the injectable formulation can be provided in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, including but not limited to sterile pyrogen free water, buffer, and dextrose solution, before use. To this end, the active compound(s) can be dried by any art-known technique, such as lyophilization, and reconstituted prior to use.</p>
      <p id="p-00203-en" num="0193">For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0194">For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions can take the form of, for example, lozenges, tablets, or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (for example, pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (for example, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (for example, magnesium stearate, talc, or silica); disintegrants (for example, potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (for example, sodium lauryl sulfate).

The tablets can be left uncoated or they can be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. They can also be coated by the techniques described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. The pharmaceutical compositions described herein can also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions.</p>
      <p id="p-00205-en" num="0195">Liquid preparations for oral administration can take the form of, for example, elixirs, solutions, syrups, or suspensions, or they can be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations can be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (for example, sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives, or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (for example, lecithin, or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (for example, almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol, Cremophoreâ¢, or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (for example, methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations can also contain buffer salts, preservatives, flavoring, coloring, and sweetening agents as appropriate.</p>
      <p id="p-00206-en" num="0196">Preparations for oral administration can be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound, as is well known.</p>
      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0197">For buccal administration, the compositions can take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in the conventional manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00208-en" num="0198">For nasal administration or administration by inhalation or insufflation, the active compound(s) or prodrug(s) can be conveniently delivered in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) form a dry powder inhaler or as an aerosol spray from pressurized packs or a nebulizer with the use of a suitable propellant (for example, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, fluorocarbons, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gas). In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit can be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator (for example, capsules and cartridges including gelatin) can be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.</p>
      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0199">Prior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product typically is micronized to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than about 5 microns). This may be achieved as is known to those of skill in the art by an appropriate method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing, spray drying and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0200">The pharmaceutical compositions can be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension can be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. The 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds can also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal or urethral administration of the drug. For rectal and vaginal routes of administration, the active compound(s) can be formulated as solutions (for retention enemas), suppositories, or ointments containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. In particular embodiments, the compounds can be formulated as urethral suppositories, for example, for use in the treatment of fertility conditions, particularly in males (for example, for the treatment of testicular dysfunction).</p>
      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0201">The presently disclosed 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds can be used for manufacturing a composition or medicament, including medicaments suitable for topical administration. Accordingly, specifically contemplated are methods for manufacturing compositions including 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds in a form that is suitable for topical administration. For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, gels, solutions, suspensions, etc., containing the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds can be employed. In certain embodiments, the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds can be formulated for topical administration with polyethylene glycol (PEG). These formulations can optionally include additional pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients such as diluents, stabilizers, and/or adjuvants. In particular embodiments, the topical formulations are formulated for the treatment of allergic conditions and/or skin conditions including psoriasis, contact dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis, among others described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0202">As those skilled in the art will recognize, the formulation of 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds, the quantity of the formulation delivered, and the duration of administration of a single dose depend on the type of inhalation device employed as well as other factors. For some aerosol delivery systems, such as nebulizers, the frequency of administration and length of time for which the system is activated will depend mainly on the concentration of 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds in the aerosol. For example, shorter periods of administration can be used at higher concentrations of 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds in the nebulizer solution. Devices such as metered dose inhalers can produce higher aerosol concentrations and can be operated for shorter periods to deliver the desired amount of 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds in some embodiments. Devices such as dry powder inhalers deliver active agent until a given charge of agent is expelled from the device. In this type of inhaler, the amount of 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds in a given quantity of the powder determines the dose delivered in a single administration. The formulation of 2,4-pyrimidinediamine is selected to yield the desired particle size in the chosen inhalation device.</p>
      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0203">Included among the devices which can be used to administer particular examples of the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds are those well-known in the art, such as metered dose inhalers, liquid nebulizers, dry powder inhalers, sprayers, thermal vaporizers, and the like. Other suitable technology for administration of particular 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds includes electrohydrodynamic aerosolizers.</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0204">In addition, the inhalation device is preferably practical, in the sense of being easy to use, small enough to carry conveniently, capable of providing multiple doses, and durable. Some specific examples of commercially available inhalation devices are Turbohaler (Astra, Wilmington, Del.), Rotahaler (Glaxo, Research Triangle Park, NC), Diskus (Glaxo, Research Triangle Park, NC), the Ultravent nebulizer (Mallinckrodt), the Acorn II nebulizer (Marquest Medical Products, Totowa, N.J.) the Ventolin metered dose inhaler (Glaxo, Research Triangle Park, NC), and the like. In one embodiment, 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds can be delivered by a dry powder inhaler or a sprayer.</p>
      <p id="p-00215-en" num="0205">Formulations of 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds for administration from a dry powder inhaler may typically include a finely divided dry powder containing 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds, but the powder can also include a bulking agent, buffer, carrier, excipient, another additive, or the like. In one aspect, hydroxynapthoate salts, such as 1-hydroxy- or 3-hydroxy-2-napthalenecarboxylate salts of the present 2,4-pyrimidinediamines have low hygroscopicity as compared to the corresponding free base form and have excellent compatibility with excipients, stability, micronize well and other pharmaceutical properties. The 1-hydroxy-2-napthalenecarboxylate salts may be referred to as âxinafoate salts.â Disclosed herein are xinafoate salts of 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds described herein. Xinafoate salts of 2,4-pyrimidinediamines described herein can be administered alone but also can be administered as a formulation in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, excipients or the like. Dry powder formulations of xinafoic acid salt forms of the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds described herein are one embodiment. Such dry powder formulations with or without a carrier or other additive are suitable for administration via inhalation. Additives can be included in a dry powder formulation of 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds, for example, to dilute the powder to facilitate for delivery from the particular powder inhaler, to facilitate processing of the formulation, to provide advantageous powder properties to the formulation, to facilitate dispersion of the powder from the inhalation device, to stabilize to the formulation (for example, antioxidants or buffers), to provide taste to the formulation, or the like. Typical additives include mono-, di-, and polysaccharides; sugar alcohols and other polyols, such as, for example, lactose, glucose, raffinose, melezitose, lactitol, maltitol, trehalose, sucrose, mannitol, starch, or combinations thereof; surfactants, such as sorbitols, diphosphatidyl choline, or lecithin; and the like. For example, a dry powder formulation can be manufactured in several ways, using conventional techniques, such as described in any of the publications mentioned above and incorporated expressly herein by reference, and, for example, Baker, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,904, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated expressly herein by reference. Particles in the size range appropriate for maximal deposition in the lower respiratory tract can be made by micronizing, milling, or the like. A liquid formulation can be manufactured by dissolving one or more of the presently 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds in a suitable solvent, such as water, at an appropriate pH, including buffers or other excipients.</p>
      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0206">For ocular administration, the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compound(s) or prodrug(s) can be formulated as a solution, emulsion, suspension, etc., suitable for administration to the eye. Administration to the eye is generally via topical exposure of the eye to the formulation, but also includes injection into the eye if necessary. A variety of vehicles suitable for administering compounds to the eye are known in the art. Specific non-limiting examples are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,261,547; U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,934; U.S. Pat. No. 6,056,950; U.S. Pat. No. 5,800,807; U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,445; U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,219; U.S. Pat. No. 5,521,222; U.S. Pat. No. 5,403,841; U.S. Pat. No. 5,077,033; U.S. Pat. No. 4,882,150; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,738,851.</p>
      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0207">Typically formulations for ocular administration contain a pharmaceutically effective amount of a 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compound disclosed herein, such as from about 0.0001% to about 1.0% by weight (w/w). In certain formulations, the pharmaceutically effective amount of the compound is 0.0003% to about 0.1% (w/w), such as from about 0.003% to about 0.5% (w/w), or from about 0.01% to about 0.03% (w/w).</p>
      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0208">In certain examples an ophthalmic composition containing a presently disclosed 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compound for ocular administration includes a tonicity agent, a buffer, or both. In certain examples of ophthalmic compositions the tonicity agent is a simple carbohydrate or a sugar alcohol. As is known to those of skill in the art, tonicity agents may be used in the present compositions to adjust the tonicity of the composition, preferably to that of normal tears. Examples of suitable tonicity agents include, without limitation sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, carbohydrates, such as dextrose, fructose, galactose, polyols, such as sugar alcohols, including by way of example, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, lactitol, isomalt, maltitol and combinations thereof. Compositions containing a buffer contain, in some examples, a phosphate, citrate, or both.</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0209">In one aspect, compositions for ocular administration of the presently disclosed 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds optionally contain a surfactant, a stabilizing polymer, or both. Surfactants are employed in certain compositions to facilitate the delivery of higher concentrations of the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compound being administered. Such surfactants can work to solubilize the compound. Exemplary surfactants include polysorbate, poloxamer, polyoxyl 40 stearate, polyoxyl castor oil, tyloxapol, triton and sorbitan monolaurate. In certain embodiments the surfactant is selected from Triton X114, tyloxapol and combinations thereof. In still another embodiment of compositions for ocular administration, the stabilizing polymer is carbomer 974p.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0210">For prolonged delivery, the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compound(s) or prodrug(s) can be formulated as a depot preparation for administration by implantation or intramuscular injection. The active ingredient can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives (for example, as a sparingly soluble salt). Alternatively, transdermal delivery systems manufactured as an adhesive disc or patch which slowly releases the active compound(s) for percutaneous absorption can be used. To this end, permeation enhancers can be used to facilitate transdermal penetration of the active compound(s). Suitable transdermal patches are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,407,713; U.S. Pat. No. 5,352,456; U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,213; U.S. Pat. No. 5,336,168; U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,561; U.S. Pat. No. 5,254,346; U.S. Pat. No. 5,164,189; U.S. Pat. No. 5,163,899; U.S. Pat. No. 5,088,977; U.S. Pat. No. 5,087,240; U.S. Pat. No. 5,008,110; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,921,475.</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0211">Alternatively, other pharmaceutical delivery systems can be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are well-known examples of delivery vehicles that can be used to deliver active compound(s) or prodrug(s). Certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) can also be employed, although usually at the cost of greater toxicity.</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0212">The pharmaceutical compositions can, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device which can contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active compound(s). The pack can, for example, include metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device can be accompanied by instructions for administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0213">Another embodiment is a kit including a compound, prodrug or pharmaceutical composition as described in any of the embodiments above. Kit embodiments are described in more detail below.</p>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="1">Methods of Use</heading>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0214">The present invention provides 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds, prodrugs and pharmaceutical compositions thereof, as described herein, for use in therapy for the conditions described herein. The present invention further provides use of the compounds of the present invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of conditions in which targeting of the JAK pathway or inhibition of JAK kinases, particularly JAK3, are therapeutically useful. These include conditions where the function of lymphocytes, macrophages, or mast cells is involved. Conditions in which targeting of the JAK pathway or inhibition of the JAK kinases, particularly JAK3, are therapeutically useful include leukemia, lymphoma, transplant rejection (for example, pancreas islet transplant rejection), bone marrow transplant applications (for example, graft-versus-host disease), autoimmune diseases (for example, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and the like), inflammation (for example, asthma, etc.) and other conditions as described in greater detail herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0215">In another embodiment, the methods can be practiced as a therapeutic approach towards the treatment of the conditions described herein. Thus, in a specific embodiment, the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds (and the various forms described herein, including pharmaceutical formulations including the compounds (in the various forms)) can be used to treat the conditions described herein in animal subjects, including humans. The methods generally include administering to the subject an amount of a compound described herein, or a salt, prodrug, hydrate, or N-oxide thereof, effective to treat the condition. In one embodiment, the subject is a non-human mammal, including, but not limited to, bovine, horse, feline, canine, rodent, or primate. In another embodiment, the subject is a human.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0216">As noted previously, numerous conditions can be treated using the 2,4-substituted pyrimidinediamine compounds, prodrugs thereof, and methods of treatment as described herein. As used herein, âTreatingâ or âtreatmentâ of a disease in a patient refers to (1) preventing the disease from occurring in a patient that is predisposed or does not yet display symptoms of the disease; (2) inhibiting the disease or arresting its development; or (3) ameliorating or causing regression of the disease. As well understood in the art, âtreatmentâ is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results, including clinical results. For the purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired results can include one or more, but are not limited to, alleviation or amelioration of one or more symptoms, diminishment of extent of a condition, including a disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of a condition, including diseases, preventing spread of disease, delay or slowing of condition, including disease, progression, amelioration or palliation of the condition, including disease, state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. Preferred are compounds that are relatively potent compared to the class as a whole and can be administered at low doses, preferably but not necessarily locally, thus minimizing systemic adverse effects.</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0217">The compounds described herein are potent and selective inhibitors of JAK kinases and are particularly selective for cytokine signaling pathways containing JAK3. As a consequence of this activity, the compounds can be used in a variety of in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo contexts to regulate or inhibit JAK kinase activity, signaling cascades in which JAK kinases play a role, and the biological responses effected by such signaling cascades. For example, in one embodiment, the compounds can be used to inhibit JAK kinase, either in vitro or in vivo, in virtually any cell type expressing the JAK kinase, such as in hematopoietic cells in which, for example, JAK3 is predominantly expressed. They can also be used to regulate signal transduction cascades in which JAK kinases, particularly JAK3, play a role. Such JAK-dependent signal transduction cascades include, but are not limited to, the signaling cascades of cytokine receptors that involve the common gamma chain, such as, for example, the IL-4, IL-7, IL-5, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21, or IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 receptor signaling cascades. The compounds can also be used in vitro or in vivo to regulate, and in particular to inhibit, cellular or biological responses affected by such JAK-dependent signal transduction cascades. Such cellular or biological responses include, but are not limited to, IL-4/ramos CD23 upregulation and IL-2 mediated T-cell proliferation. Importantly, the compounds can be used to inhibit JAK kinases in vivo as a therapeutic approach towards the treatment or prevention of diseases mediated, either wholly or in part, by a JAK kinase activity (referred to herein as âJAK kinase mediated diseasesâ). Non-limiting examples of JAK kinase mediated diseases that can be treated or prevented with the presently disclosed compounds include, but are not limited to, the following: allergies; asthma; autoimmune diseases, including systemic autoimmune disorders, transplant rejection (for example, kidney, heart, lung, liver, pancreas, skin; host versus graft reaction (HVGR), and graft versus host reaction (GVHR)), rheumatoid arthritis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, and Sjogren's syndrome; Type II inflammatory diseases such as vascular inflammation (including vasculitis, arteritis, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease); diseases of the central nervous system such as stroke; pulmonary diseases such as bronchitis obliterans and primary pulmonary hypertension; solid, delayed Type IV hypersensitivity reactions; and hematologic malignancies such as leukemia and lymphomas.</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0218">In addition to the disorders listed above, the disclosed compounds are particularly useful for the treatment of obstructive, restrictive or inflammatory airways diseases of whatever type, etiology, or pathogenesis, in particular an obstructive, restrictive or inflammatory airways disease, including, as mentioned above, asthma, inparticular atopic asthma, allergic asthma, non-atopic asthma, bronchial asthma, non-allergic asthma, emphysematous asthma, exercise-induced asthma, emotion-induced asthma, extrinsic asthma caused by environmental factors, infective asthma associated with bacterial, fungal, protozoal and/or viral infection, bronchiolitis, cough variant asthma, drug induced asthma, and the like.

      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0241">In a specific embodiment, the compounds can be used to treat and/or prevent rejection in organ and/or tissue transplant recipients (i.e., treat and/or prevent allograft rejection). Allografts can be rejected through either a cell-mediated or humoral immune reaction of the recipient against transplant (histocompability) antigens present on the membranes of the donor's cells. The strongest antigens are governed by a complex of genetic loci termed human leukocyte group A (HLA) antigens. Together with the ABO blood groups antigens, they are the chief transplantation antigens detectable in humans.</p>
      <p id="p-00236-en" num="0242">Rejection following transplantation can generally be broken into three categories: hyperacute, occurring hours to days following transplantation; acute, occurring days to months following transplantation; and chronic, occurring months to years following transplantation.</p>
      <p id="p-00237-en" num="0243">Hyperacute rejection is caused mainly by the production of host antibodies that attack the graft tissue. In a hyperacute rejection reaction, antibodies are observed in the transplant vascular very soon after transplantation. Shortly thereafter, vascular clotting occurs, leading to ischemia, eventual necrosis and death. The graft infarction is unresponsive to known immunosuppressive therapies. Because HLA antigens can be identified in vitro, pre-transplant screening is used to significantly reduce hyperacute rejection. As a consequence of this screening, hyperacute rejection is relatively uncommon today.</p>
      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0244">Acute rejection is thought to be mediated by the accumulation of antigen specific cells in the graft tissue. The T-cell-mediated immune reaction against these antigens (i.e., HVGR or GVHR) is the principle mechanism of acute rejection. Accumulation of these cells leads to damage of the graft tissue. It is believed that both CD4+ helper T-cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells are involved in the process and that the antigen is presented by donor and host dendritic cells. The CD4+ helper T-cells help recruit other effector cells, such as macrophages and eosinophils, to the graft. Accessing T-cell activation signal transduction cascades (for example, CD28, CD40L, and CD2 cascades) are also involved.</p>
      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0245">The cell-mediated acute rejection can be reversed in many cases by intensifying immunotherapy. After successful reversal, severely damaged elements of the graft heal by fibrosis and the remainder of the graft appears normal. After resolution of acute rejection, dosages of immunosuppressive drugs can be reduced to very low levels.</p>
      <p id="p-00240-en" num="0246">Chronic rejection, which is a particular problem in renal transplants, often progresses insidiously despite increased immunosuppressive therapy. It is thought to be due, in large part, to cell-mediated Type IV hypersensitivity. The pathologic profile differs from that of acute rejection. The arterial endothelium is primarily involved with extensive proliferation that may gradually occlude the vessel lumen, leading to ischemia, fibrosis, a thickened intima, and atherosclerotic changes. Chronic rejection is mainly due to a progressive obliteration of graft vasculature and resembles a slow, vasculitic process.</p>
      <p id="p-00241-en" num="0247">In Type IV hypersensitivity, CD8 cytotoxic T-cells and CD4 helper T cells recognize either intracellular or extracellular synthesized antigen when it is complexed, respectively, with either Class I or Class II MHC molecules. Macrophages function as antigen-presenting cells and release IL-1, which promotes proliferation of helper T-cells. Helper T-cells release interferon gamma and IL-2, which together regulate delayed hyperactivity reactions mediated by macrophage activation and immunity mediated by T cells. In the case of organ transplant, the cytotoxic T-cells destroy the graft cells on contact.</p>
      <p id="p-00242-en" num="0248">Since JAK kinases play a critical role in the activation of T-cells, the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds described herein can be used to treat and/or prevent many aspects of transplant rejection, and are particularly useful in the treatment and/or prevention of rejection reactions that are mediated, at least in part, by T-cells, such as HVGR or GVHR. The 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds can also be used to treat and/or prevent chronic rejection in transplant recipients and, in particular, in renal transplant recipients. The compound can also be administered to a tissue or an organ prior to transplanting the tissue or organ in the transplant recipient.</p>

In certain embodiments of the methods the autoimmune disease is multiple sclerosis (MS), psoriasis, or Sjogran's syndrome.</p>
      <p id="p-00244-en" num="0250">Therapy using the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds described herein can be applied alone, or it can be applied in combination with or adjunctive to other common immunosuppressive therapies, such as, for example, the following: mercaptopurine; corticosteroids such as prednisone; methylprednisolone and prednisolone; alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide; calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus; inhibitors of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) such as mycophenolate, mycophenolate mofetil, and azathioprine; and agents designed to suppress cellular immunity while leaving the recipient's humoral immunologic response intact, including various antibodies (for example, antilymphocyte globulin (ALG), antithymocyte globulin (ATG), monoclonal anti-T-cell antibodies (OKT3)) and irradiation. These various agents can be used in accordance with their standard or common dosages, as specified in the prescribing information accompanying commercially available forms of the drugs (see also: the prescribing information in the 2006 Edition of The Physician's Desk Reference), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

      <p id="p-00245-en" num="0251">In another embodiment, the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds could be administered either in combination or adjunctively with an inhibitor of a Syk kinase. Syk kinase is a tyrosine kinase known to play a critical role in FcÎ³ receptor signaling, as well as in other signaling cascades, such as those involving B-Cell receptor signaling (Tumer et al., (2000), Immunology Today 21:148-154) and integrins beta(1), beta (2), and beta (3) in neutrophils (Mocsavi et al., (2002), Immunity 16:547-558). For example, Syk kinase plays a pivotal role in high affinity IgE receptor signaling in mast cells that leads to activation and subsequent release of multiple chemical mediators that trigger allergic attacks. However, unlike the JAK kinases, which help regulate the pathways involved in delayed or cell-mediated Type IV hypersensitivity reactions, Syk kinase helps regulate the pathways involved in immediate IgE-mediated, Type I hypersensitivity reactions. Certain compounds that affect the Syk pathway may or may not also affect the JAK pathways.</p>

In one aspect of the disclosed method for treating ocular disorders, administration of one or more of the presently disclosed 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds is effective to increase tear production volume as compared to untreated tear production volume, thereby ameliorating a symptom of dry eye syndrome. In one aspect, tear production volume is increased within five days, such as in less than four days, and in some examples in less than two days. In one embodiment, tear production volume is increased by at least about 25% over initial tear production within two days of initial treatment with a presently disclosed 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compound. In other embodiments, tear production is increased at least about 30%, such as at least about 50% over initial tear production within less than two days. Increases in tear production upon administration of the present compounds results, in some instances, in tear production volume comparable to normal tear production. Typically the disclosed compounds, when used for treating ocular disorders topically, are administered at least once daily and typically at most twice a day.</p>
      <p id="p-00257-en" num="0263">As mentioned, another embodiment provides a method of treating a disease and/or disorder of the eye, which includes administering to a subject an amount of a compound effective to treat the disease and/or disorder of the eye wherein the compound is according to formula I, as described herein. Diseases and disorders of the eye include, but are not limited to, dry eye syndrome, uveitis, allergic conjunctivitus, glaucoma and rosacea (of the eye). Dry eye syndrome (DES), otherwise known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), keratitis sicca, sicca syndrome, or xerophthalmia, is an eye disease caused by decreased tear production or increased tear film evaporation commonly found in humans and some animals. Uveitis or iridocyclitis refers to inflammation of the middle layer of the eye (the âuveaâ) and in common usage may refer to any inflammatory process involving the interior of the eye. Allergic conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva (the membrane covering the white part of the eye) due to allergy. Glaucoma refers to a group of diseases that affect the optic nerve and involves a loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern, i.e., a type of optic neuropathy. Raised intraocular pressure is a significant risk factor for developing glaucoma (above 22 mmHg or 2.9 kPa), and inflammatory processes, e.g. uveitis, can cause this rise in intraocular pressure. Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by facial erythema but it can affect the eyes. As mentioned, compounds described herein may be used to treat inflammatory responses. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that compounds described herein are effective treatments of these eye disorders due, at least in part, to their JAK inhibitory activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00258-en" num="0264">In one embodiment, for treatment of diseases and/or disorders of the eye, the compounds described herein, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms thereof, are administered either in combination or adjunctively with at least one of an antihistamine, an antibiotic, an anti-inflammatory, an antiviral and a glaucoma medication. Examples of common antibiotics used in the eye are sulfacetamide, erythromycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Corticosteroids (sometimes referred to as âsteroidsâ) are similar to a natural substance produced by the adrenal gland and are very effective anti-inflammatories for a wide variety of eye problems. Corticosteroids can be safely used in the eye, and do not carry most of the risks associated with oral steroids like prednisone. Cortisteroids used to treat the eye include, but are not limited to, prednisolone, fluorometholone and dexamethasone. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories for the eye include, but are not limited to, ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketorolac and flurbiprofen. Common antihistamines include livostin, patanol, cromolyn, alomide. There are also non-prescription antihistamines for the eye, which are less potent but can be very helpful in milder case, such as pheniramine. Common antiviral eye medications include, but are not limited to, triflurthymidine, adenine, arabinoside and idoxuridine. Glaucoma medications all attempt to reduce the eye's intraocular pressure, the fluid pressure inside the eye, to prevent damage to the optic nerve resulting in loss of vision. These medications may lower pressure by decreasing the amount of fluid produced in the eye, by increasing the amount of fluid exiting through the eye's natural drain, or by providing additional pathways for fluid to leave the eye. Often more than one glaucoma medication will be used simultaneously, as these effects can combine to lower pressure even further than possible with one medicine alone. Common glaucoma medications include, but are not limited to, betablockers such as timolol, metipranolol, carteolol, betaxolol and levobunolol; prostaglandin analogues such as latanoprost; cholinergic agonists such as pilocarpine and carbachol; alpha agonists such as bromonidine and iopidine; carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as dorzolamide; and adenergic agonists such as epinephrine and dipivefrin.</p>
      <p id="p-00259-en" num="0265">Active compounds described herein typically inhibit the JAK/Stat pathway. The activity of a specified compound as an inhibitor of a JAK kinase can be assessed in vitro or in vivo. In some embodiments, the activity of a specified compound can be tested in a cellular assay. Suitable assays include assays that determine inhibition of either the phosphorylation activity or ATPase activity of a JAK kinase. Thus, a compound is said to inhibit an activity of a JAK kinase if it inhibits the phosphorylation or ATPase activity of a JAK kinase with an IC<sub>50 </sub>of about 20 Î¼M or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00260-en" num="0266">âCell proliferative disorderâ refers to a disorder characterized by abnormal proliferation of cells. A proliferative disorder does not imply any limitation with respect to the rate of cell growth, but merely indicates loss of normal controls that affect growth and cell division. Thus, in some embodiments, cells of a proliferative disorder can have the same cell division rates as normal cells but do not respond to signals that limit such growth. Within the ambit of âcell proliferative disorderâ is neoplasm or tumor, which is an abnormal growth of tissue. Cancer refers to any of various malignant neoplasms characterized by the proliferation of cells that have the capability to invade surrounding tissue and/or metastasize to new colonization sites.</p>
      <p id="p-00261-en" num="0267">âHematopoietic neoplasmâ refers to a cell proliferative disorder arising from cells of the hematopoietic lineage. Generally, hematopoiesis is the physiological process whereby undifferentiated cells or stem cells develop into various cells found in the peripheral blood. In the initial phase of development, hematopoietic stem cells, typically found in the bone marrow, undergo a series of cell divisions to form multipotent progenitor cells that commit to two main developmental pathways: the lymphoid lineage and the myeloid lineage. The committed progenitor cells of the myeloid lineage differentiate into three major sub-branches including the erythroid, megakaryocyte, and granulocyte/monocyte developmental pathways. An additional pathway leads to formation of dendritic cells, which are involved in antigen presentation. The erythroid lineage gives rise to red blood cells while the megakaryocytic lineage gives rise to blood platelets. Committed cells of the granulocyte/monocyte lineage split into granulocyte or monocyte developmental pathways, the former pathway leading to formation of neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils and the latter pathway giving rise to blood monocytes and macrophages.</p>
      <p id="p-00262-en" num="0268">Committed progenitor cells of the lymphoid lineage develop into the B cell pathway, T cell pathway, or the non-T/B cell pathway. Similar to the myeloid lineage, an additional lymphoid pathway appears to give rise to dendritic cells involved in antigen presentation. The B cell progenitor cell develops into a precursor B cell (pre-B), which differentiates into B cells responsible for producing immunoglobulins. Progenitor cells of the T cell lineage differentiate into precursor T cells (pre-T) that, based on the influence of certain cytokines, develop into cytotoxic or helper/suppressor T cells involved in cell mediated immunity. Non-T/B cell pathway leads to generation of natural killer (NK) cells. Neoplasms of hematopoietic cells can involve cells of any phase of hematopoiesis, including hematopoietic stem cells, multipotent progenitor cells, oligopotent committed progenitor cells, precursor cells, and mature differentiated cells. The categories of hematopoietic neoplasms can generally follow the descriptions and diagnostic criteria employed by those of skill in the art (see, for example, International Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems (ICD 10), World Health Organization (2003)). Hematopoietic neoplasms can also be characterized based on the molecular features, such as cell surface markers and gene expression profiles, cell phenotype exhibited by the aberrant cells, and/or chromosomal aberrations (for example, deletions, translocations, insertions, etc.) characteristic of certain hematopoietic neoplasms, such as the Philadelphia chromosome found in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Other classifications include National Cancer Institute Working Formulation (Cancer, 1982, 49:2112-2135) and Revised European-American Lymphoma Classification (REAL).</p>
      <p id="p-00263-en" num="0269">âLymphoid neoplasmâ refers a proliferative disorder involving cells of the lymphoid lineage of hematopoiesis. Lymphoid neoplasms can arise from hematopoietic stem cells as well as lymphoid committed progenitor cells, precursor cells, and terminally differentiated cells. These neoplasms can be subdivided based on the phenotypic attributes of the aberrant cells or the differentiated state from which the abnormal cells arise. Subdivisions include, among others, B cell neoplasms, T cell neoplasms, NK cell neoplasms, and Hodgkin's lymphoma.</p>
      <p id="p-00264-en" num="0270">âMyeloid neoplasmâ refers to proliferative disorder of cells of the myeloid lineage of hematopoiesis. Neoplasms can arise from hematopoietic stem cells, myeloid committed progenitor cells, precursor cells, and terminally differentiated cells. Myeloid neoplasms can be subdivided based on the phenotypic attributes of the aberrant cells or the differentiated state from which the abnormal cells arise. Subdivisions include, among others, myeloproliferative diseases, myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases, myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute biphenotypic leukemia.</p>
      <p id="p-00265-en" num="0271">Generally cell proliferative disorders treatable with the compounds disclosed herein relate to any disorder characterized by aberrant cell proliferation.

The term âcancerous cellâ as provided herein, includes a cell afflicted by any one of the above-identified conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00266-en" num="0272">In some embodiments, the cell proliferative disorder treated is a hematopoietic neoplasm, which is aberrant growth of cells of the hematopoietic system. Hematopoietic malignancies can have its origins in pluripotent stem cells, multipotent progenitor cells, oligopotent committed progenitor cells, precursor cells, and terminally differentiated cells involved in hematopoiesis. Some hematological malignancies are believed to arise from hematopoietic stem cells, which have the ability for self renewal. For instance, cells capable of developing specific subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) upon transplantation display the cell surface markers of hematopoietic stem cells, implicating hematopoietic stem cells as the source of leukemic cells. Blast cells that do not have a cell marker characteristic of hematopoietic stem cells appear to be incapable of establishing tumors upon transplantation (Blaire et al., 1997<i>, Blood </i>89:3104-3112). The stem cell origin of certain hematological malignancies also finds support in the observation that specific chromosomal abnormalities associated with particular types of leukemia can be found in normal cells of hematopoietic lineage as well as leukemic blast cells. For instance, the reciprocal translocation t(9q34;22q11) associated with approximately 95% of chronic myelogenous leukemia appears to be present in cells of the myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid lineage, suggesting that the chromosomal aberration originates in hematopoietic stem cells. A subgroup of cells in certain types of CML displays the cell marker phenotype of hematopoietic stem cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00267-en" num="0273">Although hematopoietic neoplasms often originate from stem cells, committed progenitor cells or more terminally differentiated cells of a developmental lineage can also be the source of some leukemias. For example, forced expression of the fusion protein Bcr/Abl (associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia) in common myeloid progenitor or granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cells produces a leukemic-like condition. Moreover, some chromosomal aberrations associated with subtypes of leukemia are not found in the cell population with a marker phenotype of hematopoietic stem cells, but are found in a cell population displaying markers of a more differentiated state of the hematopoietic pathway (Turhan et al., 1995<i>, Blood </i>85:2154-2161). Thus, while committed progenitor cells and other differentiated cells may have only a limited potential for cell division, leukemic cells may have acquired the ability to grow unregulated, in some instances mimicking the self-renewal characteristics of hematopoietic stem cells (Passegue et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>2003, 100:11842-9).</p>
      <p id="p-00268-en" num="0274">In some embodiments, the hematopoietic neoplasm treated is a lymphoid neoplasm, where the abnormal cells are derived from and/or display the characteristic phenotype of cells of the lymphoid lineage. Lymphoid neoplasms can be subdivided into B-cell neoplasms, T and NK-cell neoplasms, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. B-cell neoplasms can be further subdivided into precursor B-cell neoplasm and mature/peripheral B-cell neoplasm. Exemplary B-cell neoplasms are precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) while exemplary mature/peripheral B-cell neoplasms are B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, plasma cell myelomaplasmacytoma, extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type, nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and Burkitt's lymphoma/Burkitt cell leukemia. The presently disclosed compounds are particularly useful in the treatment of T-cell and Nk-cell neoplasms, which are further subdivided into precursor T-cell neoplasm and mature (peripheral) T-cell neoplasms. An exemplary precursor T-cell neoplasm is precursor T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) while exemplary mature (peripheral) T-cell neoplasms are T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia T-cell granular lymphocytic leukemia, aggressive NK-cell leukemia, adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (HTLV-1), extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma, hepatosplenic gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, Mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome, Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, T/null cell, primary cutaneous type, Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise characterized, Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, T/null cell, primary systemic type. The third member of lymphoid neoplasms is Hodgkin's lymphoma, also referred to as Hodgkin's disease. Exemplary diagnoses of this class that can be treated with the compounds include, among others, nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma, and various classical forms of Hodgkin's disease, exemplary members of which are Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's lymphoma (grades 1 and 2), Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, Mixed cellularity Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Lymphocyte depletion Hodgkin's lymphoma. In various embodiments, any of the lymphoid neoplasms that are associated with aberrant JAK activity can be treated with the JAK inhibitory compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00269-en" num="0275">In some embodiments, the hematopoietic neoplasm treated is a myeloid neoplasm. This group includes a large class of cell proliferative disorders involving or displaying the characteristic phenotype of the cells of the myeloid lineage. Myeloid neoplasms can be subdivided into myeloproliferative diseases, myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases, myelodysplastic syndromes, and acute myeloid leukemias. Exemplary myeloproliferative diseases are chronic myelogenous leukemia (for example, Philadelphia chromosome positive (t(9;22)(qq34;q11)), chronic neutrophilic leukemia, chronic eosinophilic leukemia/hypereosinophilic syndrome, chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia. Exemplary myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases are chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Exemplary myelodysplastic syndromes are refractory anemia, with ringed sideroblasts and without ringed sideroblasts, refractory cytopenia (myelodysplastic syndrome) with multilineage dysplasia, refractory anemia (myelodysplastic syndrome) with excess blasts, 5q-syndrome, and myelodysplastic syndrome. In various embodiments, any of the myeloid neoplasms that are associated with aberrant JAK activity can be treated with the JAK inhibitory compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00270-en" num="0276">In some embodiments, the JAK inhibitory compounds can be used to treat acute myeloid leukemias (AML), which represent a large class of myeloid neoplasms having its own subdivision of disorders. These subdivisions include, among others, AMLs with recurrent cytogenetic translocations, AML with multilineage dysplasia, and other AML not otherwise categorized. Exemplary AMLs with recurrent cytogenetic translocations include, among others, AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22), AML1(CBF-alpha)/ETO, Acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML with t(15;17)(q22;q11-12) and variants, PML/RAR-alpha), AML with abnormal bone marrow eosinophils (inv(16)(p13q22) or t(16;16)(p13;q11), CBFb/MYH11X), and AML with 11q23 (MLL) abnormalities. Exemplary AML with multilineage dysplasia are those that are associated with or without prior myelodysplastic syndrome. Other acute myeloid leukemias not classified within any definable group include, AML minimally differentiated, AML without maturation, AML with maturation, Acute myelomonocytic leukemia, Acute monocytic leukemia, Acute erythroid leukemia, Acute megakaryocytic leukemia, Acute basophilic leukemia, and Acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis.</p>
      <p id="p-00271-en" num="0277">One means of assaying for such inhibition is detection of the effect of the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds on the upregulation of downstream gene products. In the Ramos/IL4 assay, B-cells are stimulated with the cytokine Interleukin-4 (IL-4) leading to the activation of the JAK/Stat pathway through phosphorylation of the JAK family kinases, JAK1 and JAK3, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor Stat-6. One of the genes upregulated by activated Stat-6 is the low affinity IgE receptor, CD23. To study the effect of inhibitors (for example, the 2,4-substituted pyrimindinediamine compounds described herein) on the JAK1 and JAK3 kinases, human Ramos B cells are stimulated with human IL-4. 20 to 24 hours post stimulation, cells are stained for upregulation of CD23 and analyzed using FACS. A reduction of the amount of CD23 present compared to control conditions indicates the test compound actively inhibits the JAK kinase pathway. An exemplary assay of this type is described in greater detail in Example 2.</p>
      <p id="p-00272-en" num="0278">The activity of the compounds described herein can further be characterized by assaying the effect of the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds described herein on the proliferative response of primary human T-cells. In this assay, primary human T-cells derived from peripheral blood and pre-activated through stimulation of the T-cell receptor and CD28, proliferate in culture in response to the cytokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2). This proliferative response is dependent on the activation of JAK1 and JAK3 tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor Stat-5. The primary human T-cells are incubated with the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds in the presence of IL-2 for 72 hours, and at the assay endpoint intracellular ATP concentrations are measured to assess cell viability. A reduction in cell proliferation compared to control conditions is indicative of inhibition of the JAK kinase pathway.</p>
      <p id="p-00273-en" num="0279">The activity of the compounds described herein can additionally be characterized by assaying the effect of the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds described herein on A549 lung epithelial cells and U937 cells. A549 lung epithelial cells and U937 cells up-regulate ICAM-1 (CD54) surface expression in response to a variety of different stimuli. Therefore, using ICAM-1 expression as readout, test compound effects on different signaling pathways can be assessed in the same cell type. Stimulation with IL-1Î² through the IL-1Î² receptor activates the TRAF6/NFÎºB pathway resulting in up-regulation of ICAM-1. IFNÎ³ induces ICAM-1 up-regulation through activation of the JAK1/JAK2 pathway. The up-regulation of ICAM-1 can be quantified by flow cytometry across a compound dose curve and EC<sub>50 </sub>values are calculated.</p>
      <p id="p-00274-en" num="0280">Active compounds as described herein generally inhibit the JAK kinase pathway with an IC<sub>50 </sub>in the range of about 1 mM or less, as measured in the assays described herein.

In instances where activity specific to a particular cell type is desired, the compound can be assayed for activity with the desired cell type and counter-screened for a lack of activity against other cell types. The desired degree of âinactivityâ in such counter screens, or the desired ratio of activity vs. inactivity, may vary for different situations and can be selected by the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00275-en" num="0281">The 2,4-pyrimidinediamine active compounds also typically inhibit IL-4 stimulated expression of CD23 in B-cells with an IC<sub>50 </sub>in the range of about 20 Î¼M or less, typically in the range of about 10 Î¼M, 1 Î¼M, 500 nM, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, or even lower. A suitable assay that can be used is the assay described in Example 2, âAssay for Ramos B-Cell Line Stimulated with IL-4.â In certain embodiments, the active 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds have an IC<sub>50 </sub>of less than or equal to 5 Î¼M, greater than 5 Î¼M but less than 20 Î¼M, greater than 20 Î¼M, or greater than 20 Î¼M but less than 50 Î¼M in the assay described in Example 2.</p>

      <p id="p-00278-en" num="0284">One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that certain crystallized, protein-ligand complexes, in particular JAK-ligand complexes, and their corresponding X-ray structure coordinates can be used to reveal new structural information useful for understanding the biological activity of kinases as described herein. As well, the key structural features of the aforementioned proteins, particularly, the shape of the ligand binding site, are useful in methods for designing or identifying selective modulators of kinases and in solving the structures of other proteins with similar features. Such protein-ligand complexes, having compounds described herein as their ligand component, are an aspect of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00279-en" num="0285">As well, one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that such suitable X-ray quality crystals can be used as part of a method of identifying a candidate agent capable of binding to and modulating the activity of kinases. Such methods can be characterized by the following aspects: a) introducing into a suitable computer program, information defining a ligand binding domain of a kinase in a conformation (for example as defined by X-ray structure coordinates obtained from suitable X-ray quality crystals as described above) where the computer program creates a model of the three dimensional structures of the ligand binding domain, b) introducing a model of the three dimensional structure of a candidate agent in the computer program, c) superimposing the model of the candidate agent on the model of the ligand binding domain, and d) assessing whether the candidate agent model fits spatially into the ligand binding domain. Aspects a-d are not necessarily carried out in the aforementioned order. Such methods can further entail: performing rational drug design with the model of the three-dimensional structure, and selecting a potential candidate agent in conjunction with computer modeling.</p>
      <p id="p-00280-en" num="0286">Additionally, one skilled in the art would appreciate that such methods can further entail: employing a candidate agent, so-determined to fit spatially into the ligand binding domain, in a biological activity assay for kinase modulation, and determining whether said candidate agent modulates kinase activity in the assay. Such methods can also include administering the candidate agent, determined to modulate kinase activity, to a mammal suffering from a condition treatable by kinase modulation, such as those described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00281-en" num="0287">Also, one skilled in the art would appreciate that compounds described herein can be used in a method of evaluating the ability of a test agent to associate with a molecule or molecular complex including a ligand binding domain of a kinase. Such a method can be characterized by the following aspects: a) creating a computer model of a kinase binding pocket using structure coordinates obtained from suitable X-ray quality crystals of the kinase, b) employing computational algorithms to perform a fitting operation between the test agent and the computer model of the binding pocket, and c) analyzing the results of the fitting operation to quantify the association between the test agent and the computer model of the binding pocket.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="2">Utility of the Compounds as Screening Agents</heading>
      <p id="p-00282-en" num="0288">To employ the compounds described herein in a method of screening for candidate agents that bind to, for example a JAK protein, the protein is bound to a support, and a compound described herein is added to the assay. Alternatively, the compound described herein is bound to the support, for example via a linker that does not prohibitively affect biological activity, and the protein is added. Classes of candidate agents among which novel binding agents can be sought include specific antibodies, non-natural binding agents identified in screens of chemical libraries, peptide analogs, etc. Of particular interest are screening assays for candidate agents that have a low toxicity for human cells. A wide variety of assays can be used for this purpose, including labeled in vitro protein-protein binding assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, immunoassays for protein binding, functional assays (phosphorylation assays, etc.) and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00283-en" num="0289">The determination of the binding of the candidate agent to, for example, a JAK protein can be done in a number of ways. In one example, the candidate agent (the compound described herein) is labeled, for example, with a fluorescent or radioactive moiety and binding determined directly. For example, this can be done by attaching all or a portion of the JAK protein to a solid support, adding a labeled agent (for example a compound described herein in which at least one atom has been replaced by a detectable isotope), washing off excess reagent, and determining whether the amount of the label is that present on the solid support. Various blocking and washing steps can be utilized as is known in the art. âLabeledâ means that the compound is either directly or indirectly labeled with something which provides a detectable signal, for example, radioisotope, fluorescent tag, enzyme, antibodies, particles such as magnetic particles, chemiluminescent tag, or specific binding molecules, etc. Specific binding molecules include pairs, such as biotin and streptavidin, digoxin and antidigoxin etc. For the specific binding members, the complementary member would normally be labeled with a molecule which provides for detection, in accordance with known procedures, as outlined above. The label can directly or indirectly provide a detectable signal.</p>
      <p id="p-00284-en" num="0290">In some embodiments, only one of the components is labeled. For example, a JAK protein can be labeled at tyrosine positions using <sup>125</sup>I, or with fluorophores. Alternatively, more than one component can be labeled with different labels; using <sup>125</sup>I for the proteins, for example, and a fluorophore for the candidate agents.</p>
      <p id="p-00285-en" num="0291">The compounds described herein can also be used as competitors to screen for additional drug candidates. âCandidate bioactive agentâ or âdrug candidateâ or grammatical equivalents as used herein describe any molecule, for example, protein, oligopeptide, small organic molecule, polysaccharide, polynucleotide, etc., to be tested for bioactivity. They may be capable of directly or indirectly altering the cellular proliferation phenotype or the expression of a cellular proliferation sequence, including both nucleic acid sequences and protein sequences. In other cases, alteration of cellular proliferation protein binding and/or activity is screened. In the case where protein binding or activity is screened, some embodiments exclude molecules already known to bind to that particular protein. Exemplary embodiments of assays described herein include candidate agents, which do not bind the target protein in its endogenous native state, termed herein as âexogenousâ agents. In one example, exogenous agents further exclude antibodies to JAK proteins.</p>
      <p id="p-00286-en" num="0292">Candidate agents can encompass numerous chemical classes, though typically they are organic molecules having a molecular weight of more than about 100 daltons and less than about 2,500 daltons. Candidate agents include functional groups necessary for structural interaction with proteins, particularly hydrogen bonding and lipophilic binding, and typically include at least an amine, carbonyl, hydroxyl, ether, or carboxyl group, for example at least two of the functional chemical groups. The candidate agents often include cyclical carbon or heterocyclyl structures and/or aromatic or polyaromatic structures substituted with one or more of the above functional groups. Candidate agents are also found among biomolecules including peptides, saccharides, fatty acids, steroids, purines, pyrimidines, derivatives, structural analogs, or combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00287-en" num="0293">Candidate agents are obtained from a wide variety of sources including libraries of synthetic or natural compounds. For example, numerous means are available for random and directed synthesis of a wide variety of organic compounds and biomolecules, including expression of randomized oligonucleotides. Alternatively, libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant and animal extracts are available or readily produced. Additionally, natural or synthetically produced libraries and compounds are readily modified through conventional chemical, physical and biochemical means. Known pharmacological agents can be subjected to directed or random chemical modifications, such as acylation, alkylation, esterification, amidification to produce structural analogs.</p>
      <p id="p-00288-en" num="0294">In one example, the binding of the candidate agent is determined through the use of competitive binding assays. In this example, the competitor is a binding moiety known to bind to a JAK protein, such as an antibody, peptide, binding partner, ligand, etc. Under certain circumstances, there may be competitive binding as between the candidate agent and the binding moiety, with the binding moiety displacing the candidate agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00289-en" num="0295">In some embodiments, the candidate agent is labeled. Either the candidate agent, or the competitor, or both, is added first to for example a JAK protein for a time sufficient to allow binding, if present. Incubations can be performed at any temperature that facilitates optimal activity, typically between 4Â° C. and 40Â° C. Incubation periods are selected for optimum activity, but can also be optimized to facilitate rapid high throughput screening. Excess reagent is generally removed or washed away. The second component is then added, and the presence or absence of the labeled component is followed, to indicate binding.</p>
      <p id="p-00290-en" num="0296">In one example, the competitor is added first, followed by the candidate agent. Displacement of the competitor is an indication the candidate agent is binding to a JAK protein and thus is capable of binding to, and potentially modulating, the activity of the JAK protein. In this embodiment, either component can be labeled. Thus, for example, if the competitor is labeled, the presence of label in the wash solution indicates displacement by the agent. Alternatively, if the candidate agent is labeled, the presence of the label on the support indicates displacement.</p>
      <p id="p-00291-en" num="0297">In an alternative embodiment, the candidate agent is added first, with incubation and washing, followed by the competitor. The absence of binding by the competitor may indicate the candidate agent is bound to a JAK protein with a higher affinity. Thus, if the candidate agent is labeled, the presence of the label on the support, coupled with a lack of competitor binding, may indicate the candidate agent is capable of binding to the JAK protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00292-en" num="0298">It may be of value to identify the binding site of a JAK protein. This can be done in a variety of ways. In one embodiment, once the JAK protein has been identified as binding to the candidate agent, the JAK protein is fragmented or modified and the assays repeated to identify the necessary components for binding.</p>
      <p id="p-00293-en" num="0299">Modulation is tested by screening for candidate agents capable of modulating the activity of a JAK protein including the steps of combining a candidate agent with the JAK protein, as above, and determining an alteration in the biological activity of the JAK protein. Thus, in this embodiment, the candidate agent should both bind to (although this may not be necessary), and alter its biological or biochemical activity as defined herein. The methods include both in vitro screening methods and in vivo screening of cells for alterations in cell viability, morphology, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00294-en" num="0300">Alternatively, differential screening can be used to identify drug candidates that bind to a native JAK protein, but cannot bind to a modified JAK protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00295-en" num="0301">A variety of other reagents can be included in the screening assays. These include reagents like salts, neutral proteins, for example, albumin, detergents, etc. which can be used to facilitate optimal protein-protein binding and/or reduce non-specific or background interactions. Also reagents that otherwise improve the efficiency of the assay, such as protease inhibitors, nuclease inhibitors, anti-microbial agents, etc., can be used. The mixture of components can be added in any order that provides for the requisite binding.</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="2">Methods of Administration</heading>
      <p id="p-00296-en" num="0302">The 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compound(s) or prodrug(s) described herein, or compositions thereof, will generally be used in an amount effective to achieve the intended result, for example, in an amount effective to treat or prevent the particular condition being treated. The compound(s) can be administered therapeutically to achieve therapeutic benefit or prophylactically to achieve prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated and/or eradication or amelioration of one or more of the symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that the patient reports an improvement in feeling or condition, notwithstanding that the patient may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For example, administration of a compound to a patient suffering from an allergy provides therapeutic benefit not only when the underlying allergic response is eradicated or ameliorated, but also when the patient reports a decrease in the severity or duration of the symptoms associated with the allergy following exposure to the allergen. As another example, therapeutic benefit in the context of asthma includes an improvement in respiration following the onset of an asthmatic attack or a reduction in the frequency or severity of asthmatic episodes. As another specific example, therapeutic benefit in the context of transplantation rejection includes the ability to alleviate an acute rejection episode, such as, for example, HVGR or GVHR, or the ability to prolong the time period between onset of acute rejection episodes and/or onset of chronic rejection. Therapeutic benefit also includes halting or slowing the progression of the disease, regardless of whether improvement is realized.</p>
      <p id="p-00297-en" num="0303">The amount of compound administered will depend upon a variety of factors, including, for example, the particular condition being treated, the mode of administration, the severity of the condition being treated, the age and weight of the patient, the bioavailability of the particular active compound. Determination of an effective dosage is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00298-en" num="0304">As known by those of skill in the art, the preferred dosage of 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds will also depend on the age, weight, general health, and severity of the condition of the individual being treated. Dosage may also need to be tailored to the sex of the individual and/or the lung capacity of the individual, where administered by inhalation. Dosage may also be tailored to individuals suffering from more than one condition or those individuals who have additional conditions which affect lung capacity and the ability to breathe normally, for example, emphysema, bronchitis, pneumonia, and respiratory infections. Dosage, and frequency of administration of the compounds or prodrugs thereof, will also depend on whether the compounds are formulated for treatment of acute episodes of a condition or for the prophylactic treatment of a disorder. For example, acute episodes of allergic conditions, including allergy-related asthma, transplant rejection, etc. A skilled practitioner will be able to determine the optimal dose for a particular individual.</p>
      <p id="p-00299-en" num="0305">For prophylactic administration, the compound can be administered to a patient at risk of developing one of the previously described conditions. For example, if it is unknown whether a patient is allergic to a particular drug, the compound can be administered prior to administration of the drug to avoid or ameliorate an allergic response to the drug. Alternatively, prophylactic administration can be applied to avoid the onset of symptoms in a patient diagnosed with the underlying disorder. For example, a compound can be administered to an allergy sufferer prior to expected exposure to the allergen. Compounds can also be administered prophylactically to healthy individuals who are repeatedly exposed to agents known to one of the above-described maladies to prevent the onset of the disorder. For example, a compound can be administered to a healthy individual who is repeatedly exposed to an allergen known to induce allergies, such as latex, in an effort to prevent the individual from developing an allergy. Alternatively, a compound can be administered to a patient suffering from asthma prior to partaking in activities which trigger asthma attacks to lessen the severity of, or avoid altogether, an asthmatic episode.</p>
      <p id="p-00300-en" num="0306">In the context of transplant rejection, the compound can be administered while the patient is not having an acute rejection reaction to avoid the onset of rejection and/or prior to the appearance of clinical indications of chronic rejection. The compound can be administered systemically to the patient as well as administered to the tissue or organ prior to transplanting the tissue or organ in the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00301-en" num="0307">The amount of compound administered will depend upon a variety of factors, including, for example, the particular indication being treated, the mode of administration, whether the desired benefit is prophylactic or therapeutic, the severity of the indication being treated and the age and weight of the patient, and the bioavailability of the particular active compound. Determination of an effective dosage is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00302-en" num="0308">Effective dosages can be estimated initially from in vitro assays. For example, an initial dosage for use in animals can be formulated to achieve a circulating blood or serum concentration of active compound that is at or above an IC<sub>50 </sub>of the particular compound as measured in an in vitro assay. Calculating dosages to achieve such circulating blood or serum concentrations taking into account the bioavailability of the particular compound is well within the capabilities of skilled artisans.

      <p id="p-00303-en" num="0309">Initial dosages can also be estimated from in vivo data, such as animal models. Animal models useful for testing the efficacy of compounds to treat or prevent the various diseases described above are well-known in the art. Suitable animal models of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions are described in Foster, (1995) Allergy 50(21Suppl):6-9, discussion 34-38 and Tumas et al., (2001), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 107(6):1025-1033. Suitable animal models of allergic rhinitis are described in Szelenyi et al., (2000), Arzneimittelforschung 50(11):1037-42; Kawaguchi et al., (1994), Clin. Exp.

Suitable animal models of systemic mastocytosis are described in O'Keefe et al., (1987), J. Vet. Intern. Med. 1(2):75-80 and Bean-Knudsen et al., (1989), Vet. Pathol. 26(1):90-92. Suitable animal models of hyper IgE syndrome are described in Claman et al., (1990), Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 56(1):46-53. Suitable animal models of B-cell lymphoma are described in Hough et al., (1998), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:13853-13858 and Hakim et al., (1996), J. Immunol. 157(12):5503-5511. Suitable animal models of atopic disorders such as atopic dermatitis, atopic eczema, and atopic asthma are described in Chan et al., (2001), J. Invest. Dermatol. 117(4):977-983 and Suto et al., (1999), Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 120(Suppl 1):70-75. Suitable animal models of transplant rejection, such as models of HVGR, are described in O'Shea et al., (2004), Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 3:555-564; Cetkovic-Curlje &amp; Tibbles, (2004), Current Pharmaceutical Design 10:1767-1784; and Chengelian et al., (2003), Science 302:875-878. Ordinarily skilled artisans can routinely adapt such information to determine dosages suitable for human administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00304-en" num="0310">Dosage amounts will typically be in the range of from about 0.0001 or 0.001 or 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 100 mg/kg/day, but can be higher or lower, depending upon, among other factors, the activity of the compound, its bioavailability, the mode of administration, and various factors discussed above. Dosage amount and interval can be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the compound(s) which are sufficient to maintain therapeutic or prophylactic effect. For example, the compounds can be administered once per week, several times per week (for example, every other day), once per day, or multiple times per day, depending upon, among other things, the mode of administration, the specific indication being treated, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. In cases of local administration or selective uptake, such as local topical administration, the effective local concentration of active compound(s) may not be related to plasma concentration. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to optimize effective local dosages without undue experimentation.</p>
      <p id="p-00305-en" num="0311">Preferably, the compound(s) will provide therapeutic or prophylactic benefit without causing substantial toxicity. Toxicity of the compound(s) can be determined using standard pharmaceutical procedures. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic (or prophylactic) effect is the therapeutic index. Compounds(s) that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred.</p>
      <p id="p-00306-en" num="0312">The foregoing disclosure pertaining to the dosage requirements for the 2,4-substituted pyrimidinediamine compounds is pertinent to dosages required for prodrugs, with the realization, apparent to the skilled artisan, that the amount of prodrug(s) administered will also depend upon a variety of factors, including, for example, the bioavailability of the particular prodrug(s) and the conversation rate and efficiency into active drug compound under the selected route of administration. Determination of an effective dosage of prodrug(s) for a particular use and mode of administration is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art.</p>

Those of skill in the art will also be able to readily adapt these examples for the synthesis of additional 2,4-substituted pyrimidinediamines as described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00318-en" num="0324">Compounds disclosed herein can be synthesized, for example, from substituted or unsubstituted uracils as illustrated in Scheme (I), below. In Scheme (I), ring A, R<sup>5</sup>, (R<sup>2</sup>)<sub>p</sub>, X, Y, Z<sup>1</sup>, and Z<sup>2 </sup>are as defined herein. According to Scheme (I), uracil A-1 is dihalogenated at the 2- and 4-positions using a standard halogenating agent such as POCl<sub>3 </sub>(or other standard halogenating agent) under standard conditions to yield 2,4-dichloropyrimidine A-2. Depending upon the R<sup>5 </sup>substituent, in pyrimidinediamine A-2, the chloride at the C4 position can be more reactive towards nucleophiles than the chloride at the C2 position. This differential reactivity can be exploited to synthesize 2,4-pyrimidinediamines I, for example when R<sup>5 </sup>is F, by first reacting 2,4-dichloropyrimidine A-2 with one equivalent of amine A-3, yielding 4N-substituted-2-chloro-4-pyrimidineamine A-4, followed by amine A-5 to yield a 2,4-pyrimidinediamine of formula A-6 (compounds of formula I, where each of R<sup>3 </sup>and R<sup>4 </sup>are H). Compounds of formula I, where either or both of R<sup>3 </sup>and R<sup>4 </sup>are non-H, can be made, for example, via alkylation of the NH groups at C2 or C4 of the pyrimidine-2,4-diamine.</p>

      <p id="p-00320-en" num="0325">Typically, the C4 halide is more reactive towards nucleophiles. However, as will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art, the identity of the R<sup>5 </sup>substituent may alter this reactivity. For example, when R<sup>5 </sup>is trifluoromethyl, a 50:50 mixture of 4N-substituted-4-pyrimidineamine A-4 and the corresponding 2N-substituted-2-pyrimidineamine (not depicted) is obtained. The regioselectivity of the reaction can also be controlled by adjusting the solvent and other synthetic conditions (such as temperature), as is well-known in the art. Alternative methods of synthesis allow for complete regioselectivity, for example, when making molecules A-6. One such method is described in relation to Scheme (II) below.</p>
      <p id="p-00321-en" num="0326">The reactions depicted in Scheme (I) to make A-4 and A-6 (and A-6 in Scheme (II) below) may proceed more quickly when the reaction mixtures are heated via microwave. When heating in this fashion, the following conditions can be used: heat to 175Â° C. in ethanol for 5-20 min. in a Smith Reactor (Personal Chemistry, Uppsala, Sweden) in a sealed tube (at 20 bar pressure).</p>
      <p id="p-00322-en" num="0327">The uracil A-1 starting materials can be purchased from commercial sources or prepared using standard techniques of organic chemistry. Commercially available uracils that can be used as starting materials in Scheme (I) include, by way of example and not limitation, uracil (Aldrich #13,078-8; CAS Registry 66-22-8); 5-bromouracil (Aldrich #85,247-3; CAS Registry 51-20-7; 5-fluorouracil (Aldrich #85,847-1; CAS Registry 51-21-8); 5-iodouracil (Aldrich #85,785-8; CAS Registry 696-07-1); 5-nitrouracil (Aldrich #85,276-7; CAS Registry 611-08-5); 5-(trifluoromethyl)-uracil (Aldrich #22,327-1; CAS Registry 54-20-6). Additional 5-substituted uracils are available from General Intermediates of Canada, Inc., Edmonton, Calif. and/or Interchim, Cedex, France, or can be prepared using standard techniques. Myriad textbook references teaching suitable synthetic methods are provided infra.</p>
      <p id="p-00323-en" num="0328">Amines A-3 and A-5 can be purchased from commercial sources or, alternatively, can be synthesized utilizing standard techniques.

      <p id="p-00324-en" num="0329">One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that in some instances, amines A-3 and A-5 and/or substituent X on uracil A-1 can include functional groups that require protection during synthesis. The exact identity of any protecting group(s) used will depend upon the identity of the functional group being protected, and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. Guidance for selecting appropriate protecting groups, as well as synthetic strategies for their attachment and removal, can be found, for example, in <i>Green </i>&amp; <i>Wuts. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00325-en" num="0330">Thus, protecting group refers to a group of atoms that, when attached to a reactive functional group in a molecule, mask, reduce or prevent the reactivity of the functional group. Typically, a protecting group can be selectively removed as desired during the course of a synthesis. Examples of protecting groups can also be found in Harrison et al., <i>Compendium of Synthetic Organic Methods</i>, Vols. 1-8, 1971-1996, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY. Representative amino protecting groups include, but are not limited to, formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (âCBZâ), tert-butoxycarbonyl (âBocâ), trimethylsilyl (âTMSâ), 2-trimethylsilyl-ethanesulfonyl (âTESâ), trityl and substituted trityl groups, allyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (âFMOCâ), nitro-veratryloxycarbonyl (âNVOCâ) and the like. Representative hydroxyl protecting groups include, but are not limited to, those where the hydroxyl group is either acylated to form acetate and benzoate esters or alkylated to form benzyl and trityl ethers, as well as alkyl ethers, tetrahydropyranyl ethers, trialkylsilyl ethers (for example, TMS or TIPPS groups) and allyl ethers.</p>

Compound A-10, a 2N,4N-disubstituted-5-fluoro-2,4-pyrimidinediamine, can be obtained by reacting 2,4-dichloro-5-fluoropyrimidine A-8 (commercially available or made from A-7 as depicted for example starting with a uracil and dehydrohalogenating with for example POCl<sub>3</sub>) with, optimally, one equivalent of amine A-3 to yield 2-chloro-N4-substituted-5-fluoro-4-pyrimidineamine A-9 followed by reaction with one or more equivalents of amine A-5, typically between about 1.1 equivalents of A-5 and about 2 equivalents of A-5. Reaction of A-9 with A-5 can be carried out, for example, via traditional heating, by microwave irradiation and by Buchwald type coupling using metal catalysts, for example, palladium coupling. The latter metal catalyzed coupling reactions are typically used when the nucleophilic partner, A-5, is poorly nucleophilic, and thus reactions where bond insertions and reductive couplings work well are used effect the transformation.</p>

Compounds disclosed herein, including those according to Formula I as described herein and including compounds of Formulas IA, IB, IC, II, III and IV can be synthesized according to Schemes I and Ia. Likewise, such compounds also can be synthesized according to Scheme II below, which describes a novel synthesis of the compounds described herein starting from ring A anilines, building the pyrimidine system onto the aniline via guanyl analogs, and then installing the 4N-heteroaryl ring system. First, amines A-5 are converted to the corresponding guanidine derivatives A-11. For example, amine A-5 is reacted with an appropriately protected guanyl electrophilic partner, for example N,N-bis-Boc-1-guanylpyrazole, for example, in the presence of a base, for example a tertiary amine base. The reaction is typically, but not necessarily, heated to between about 40Â° C. and about 60Â° C. for between about 24 h and about 48 h. After this step, any protecting groups are removed.</p>

      <p id="p-00332-en" num="0000">For example, when N,N-bis-Boc-1-guanylpyrazole is used, an acid is added to the mixture (optionally the volatiles are removed from the reaction first) to remove the Boc protecting groups and provide A-11. Guanidines A-11 are reacted with the appropriate 1,3-dielectrophile, for example Î²-aldehyde esters, A-12 (where R<sup>e </sup>is defined as in formula I), for example by heating the guanidine in an alcoholic solvent in the presence of base. In one example, sodium ethoxide in ethanol is used. The reaction heated to between about 40Â° C. and about 80Â° C. for between about 24 h and about 48 h to give the corresponding 4-hydroxy-pyrimidine-2-amine, A-13. One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that other 1,3-dielectrophiles can be used to make pyrimidine intermediates A-13, for example, 2-substituted cyanoacetaldehydes and Î±,Î²-unsaturated esters such as alkyl 2-(acetoxymethyl)acrylates (Baylis-Hillman acetates, for example as reported in <i>Bull. Korean Chemical Soc. </i>2007, Vol. 28, No. 12, 2505-2507, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes), and the like. Intermediates A-13 may be purified in some instances or used âas isâ in the next reaction, where they are converted to the corresponding 4-leaving group-pyrimidine-2-amines, A-14. For example, intermediates A-13 can be reacted with, for example, POCl<sub>3 </sub>to provide the corresponding 4-chloro-pyrimidine-2-amine, that is, amines A-14 where LG is chlorine. One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that other leaving groups would work, for example, the hydroxy group of intermediate A-13 can be converted to a mesylate and then used for the next step, for example, in lieu of a 4-halo intermediate. Compounds A-6 (compounds of formula I where R<sup>3 </sup>and R<sup>4 </sup>are H) are formed by reaction of the intermediate A-14 with amines A-3, for example, as described above in Schemes I and Ia in relation to reaction with intermediates A-2 and/or A-8, respectively. Compounds of formula I, where R<sup>3 </sup>and/or R<sup>4 </sup>are non-H, are made, for example, by alkylating compounds A-6 with the appropriate alkylating reagents, as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. Alternatively, guanidines like A-11, but where the NH bearing ring A is rather NR<sup>4 </sup>(where R<sup>4 </sup>is for example alkyl) can be used to make compounds of formula I where R<sup>4 </sup>is other than H.</p>

NBS (15.4 g, 86.6 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for two days at room temperature. Analysis by TLC and HPLC indicated that in addition to the desired product several side products had been formed (regio-isomers and di-brominated side products). Silica gel was added to the reaction mixture and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting dry crude product was loaded on a chromatography column and purified by eluting with hexanes/ethyl acetate (gradient 0% to 15% ethyl acetate).

The white suspension was heated for 3 hours at 130Â° C. After approximately 1 hour the suspension became a clear yellow solution. The reaction was then quenched by slowly pouring the reaction mixture into a baker containing crushed ice. The aqueous phase was then extracted with DCM (3Ã50 ml) and dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub>. After evaporation of solvents the reaction product was obtained as a white solid (3.72 g, 96%). The JAK inhibitors were prepared by the standard sequence of 1<sup>st </sup>S<sub>N</sub>Ar reaction with the LHS carbamate aniline and 2<sup>nd </sup>S<sub>N</sub>Ar reaction with the RHS aniline or d<sub>3</sub>-aniline (deuterated anilines were prepared the same way as the non-deuterated anilines using CD<sub>3</sub>I instead of MeI). <ul id="ul-00022-en" list-style="none"><li>I-221: 5-(2-(4-fluoro-3-methoxy-5-methylphenylamino)-6-D-5-trideuteromethylpyrimidin-4-ylamino)benzo[d]oxazol-2(3H)-one</li></ul></p>

      <p id="p-00422-en" num="0702">The following example illustrates the preparation of a xinafoate salt of a 2,4-pyrimidinediamine described herein. A suspension of a 2,4-pyrimidinediamine as described herein (1 equiv) in a ketonic solvent (about 20 ml solvent/g of 2,4-pyrimidinediamine, for example MEK), is heated to between about 50Â° C. and about 60Â° C. Water (about 1 ml water/g of 2,4-pyrimidinediamine) is added, resulting in a solution. The solution may be passed through a filter for clarification if necessary. The solution is held to between about 50Â° C. and about 60Â° C. for between about 30 minutes and about 1.5 h. A homogeneous solution of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (1.1 equiv) in a ketone solvent (about 4 ml solvent/g of naphthoic acid, for example MEK) is added which results in precipitation of a solid after between about 5 minutes and 15 minutes. The reaction is cooled to ambient temperature, stirred for between about 15 h and about 20 h, and then cooled to between about 0Â° C. and about 10Â° C. for between about 1 h and about 2 h. The precipitated xinafoic acid salt is then filtered and collected. The filtered solid is washed, for example twice with a ketonic solvent (about 2 ml/g, for example MEK) and dried under reduced pressure at between about 40Â° C. and about 60Â° C., for between about 10 h and about 20 h. The xinafoic acid salt is the processed accordingly, for example, micronized and formulated as described herein, for example, in a formulation for administration by inhalation. In a particular embodiment, compound I-217 is the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine used in this Example.</p>

      <p id="p-00423-en" num="0703">B-cells stimulated with cytokine Interleukin-4 (IL-4) activate the JAK/Stat pathway through phosphorylation of the JAK family kinases, JAK-1 and JAK-3, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor Stat-6. One of the genes upregulated by activated Stat-6 is the low affinity IgE receptor, CD23. To study the effect of inhibitors on the JAK family kinases, human Ramos B cells were stimulated with human IL-4 and the surface expression of CD23 was measured.</p>
      <p id="p-00424-en" num="0704">The Ramos B-cell line was acquired from ATCC (ATCC Catalog No. CRL-1596).

Cells were maintained at a density of 3.5Ã10<sup>5</sup>. The day before the experiment, Ramos B-cells were diluted to 3.5Ã10<sup>5 </sup>cells/mL to ensure that they were in a logarithmic growth phase.</p>

The cells were resuspended in Yssel's medium (Gemini Bio-products, Woodland, Calif., Catalog #400-103) containing 40 U/mL recombinant IL2 (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., Catalog #202-IL (20 Î¼g)) and seeded into a flask pre-coated with 1 Î¼g/mL anti-CD3 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif., Catalog #555336) and 5 Î¼g/mL anti-CD28 (Immunotech, Beckman Coulter of Brea Calif., Catalog #IM1376). The primary T-cells were stimulated for 3-4 days, then transferred to a fresh flask and maintained in RPMI with 10% FBS and 40 U/mL IL-2.</p>
      <p id="p-00428-en" num="0708">The day prior to the assay set up, primary T-cells were centrifuged and resuspended in fresh RPMI with 10% FBS but without IL-2 and starved overnight. For the assay, the primary T-cells were centrifuged and resuspended Yssel's medium at 2Ã10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL. 50 Î¼L of cell suspension containing 80 U/mL IL-2 was added to each well of a flat bottom 96 well black plate. For the unstimulated control, IL-2 was omitted from the last column on the plate. Compounds were serially diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.7% pure, cell culture tested, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., Catalog No. D2650) from 5 mM in 3-fold dilutions, and then diluted 1:250 in Yssel's medium. 50 Î¼L of 2Ã compound was added per well in duplicate and the cells were allowed to proliferate for 72 hours at 37Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00429-en" num="0709">Proliferation was measured using CellTiter-GloÂ® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega), which determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, as an indicator of metabolically active cells. The substrate was thawed and allowed to come to ambient temperature. After mixing the Cell Titer-Glo reagent and diluent together, 100 Î¼L was added to each well. The plates were mixed on an orbital shaker for two minutes to induce lysis and incubated at ambient temperature for an additional ten minutes to allow the signal to equilibrate. Detection was performed using a Wallac Victor2 1420 multilabel counter purchased from Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.</p>

      <p id="p-00430-en" num="0710">Lung epithelial cells, A549, up-regulate ICAM-1 (CD54) surface expression in response to a variety of different stimuli. Therefore, using ICAM-1 expression as readout, compound effects on different signaling pathways can be assessed in the same cell type. IFNÎ³ up-regulates ICAM-1 through activation of the JAK/Stat pathway. In this example, the up-regulation of ICAM-1 by IFNÎ³ was assessed.</p>
      <p id="p-00431-en" num="0711">The A549 lung epithelial carcinoma cell line originated from the American Type Culture Collection. Routine culturing was with F12K media (Mediatech Inc., Lenexa, Kans., Cat. No. 10-025-CV) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 I.U. penicillin and 100 ng/mL streptomycin (complete F12k media). Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37Â° C. Prior to use in the assay, A549 cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized (Mediatech Inc., Cat. No. 25-052-CI) to lift the cells. The trypsin cell suspension was neutralized with complete F12K media and centrifuged to pellet the cells. The cell pellet was resuspended in complete F12K media at a concentration of 2.0Ã10<sup>5 </sup>mL. Cells were seeded at 20,000 per well, 100 Î¼L total volume, in a flat bottom tissue culture plate and allowed to adhere overnight.</p>

The cells were then stimulated with IFNÎ³ (75 ng/mL) (Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, N.J., Cat. No. 300-02) and allowed to incubate for 24 hours. The final test compound dose range was 30 Î¼M to 14 nM in 200 Î¼L F12K media containing 5% FBS, 0.3% DMSO.</p>
      <p id="p-00433-en" num="0713">On day three, the cell media was removed and the cells were washed with 200 Î¼L PBS (phosphate buffered saline). Each well was trypsinized to dissociate the cells, then neutralized by addition of 200 Î¼L complete F12K media. Cells were pelleted and stained with an APC conjugated mouse anti-human ICAM-1 (CD54) (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif., Catalog #559771) antibody for 20 minutes at 4Â° C. Cells were washed with ice cold FACS buffer (PBS+2% FBS) and surface ICAM-1 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. Detection was performed using a BD LSR I System Flow Cytometer, purchased from BD Biosciences of San Jose, Calif. Events were gated for live scatter and the geometric mean was calculated (Becton-Dickinson CellQuest software version 3.3, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). Geometric means were plotted against the compound concentration to generate a dose response curve.</p>

      <p id="p-00446-en" num="0725">A mutation in the JH2 pseudokinase domain of JAK2 (JAK2 V617F) has been described in chronic myeloproliferative disorders as well as a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Mutation of the negative regulatory JH2 domain dysregulates the kinase enabling it to constitutively associate with the EPO receptor and become activated. UKE-1 cells, derived from an AML patient, express JAK2 V617F which drives their proliferation. The IL-3-dependent BaF3 myeloid cell line was engineered to express JAK2 V617F allowing it to proliferate in an IL-3-independent manner. The effect of JAK inhibitors on the proliferation of these cell lines can be used to assess the cellular activity of the compounds against JAK2.</p>
