    <summary>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to benzodiazepinone compounds useful as Notch inhibitors. The invention further pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound according to the invention that is useful for the treatment of conditions related to the Notch pathway, such as cancer and other proliferative diseases.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Notch signaling has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, such as cell fate specification, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. (Bray, <i>Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology, </i>7:678-689 (2006); Fortini, <i>Developmental Cell, </i>16:633-647 (2009)). The Notch proteins are single-pass heterodimeric transmembrane molecules. The Notch family includes 4 receptors, NOTCH 1-4, which become activated upon binding to ligands from the DSL family (Delta-like 1, 3, 4 and Jagged 1 and 2).</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The activation and maturation of NOTCH requires a series of processing steps, including a proteolytic cleavage step mediated by gamma secretase, a multiprotein complex containing Presenilin 1 or Presenilin 2, nicastrin, APH1, and PEN2. Once NOTCH is cleaved, NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD) is released from the membrane. The released NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it functions as a transcriptional activator in concert with CSL family members (RBPSUH, âsuppressor of hairlessâ, and LAG1). NOTCH target genes include HES family members, such as HES-1. HES-1 functions as transcriptional repressors of genes such as HERP1 (also known as HEY2), HERP2 (also known as HEY1), and HATH1 (also known as ATOH1).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The aberrant activation of the Notch pathway contributes to tumorigenesis. Activation of Notch signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various solid tumors including ovarian, pancreatic, as well as breast cancer and hematologic tumors such as leukemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. The role of Notch inhibition and its utility in the treatment of various solid and hematological tumors are described in Miele, L. et al., <i>Current Cancer Drug Targets, </i>6:313-323 (2006); Bolos, V. et al., <i>Endocrine Reviews, </i>28:339-363 (2007); Shih, I-M. et al., <i>Cancer Research, </i>67:1879-1882 (2007); Yamaguchi, N. et al., <i>Cancer Research, </i>68:1881-1888 (2008); Miele, L., <i>Expert Review Anticancer Therapy, </i>8:1197-1201 (2008); Purow, B., <i>Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, </i>10:154-160 (2009); Nefedova, Y. et al., <i>Drug Resistance Updates, </i>11:210-218 (2008); Dufraine, J. et al., <i>Oncogene, </i>27:5132-5137 (2008); and Jun, H.

The reactions are performed in solvents appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and are suitable for the transformations being effected. Also, in the description of the synthetic methods described below, it is to be understood that all proposed reaction conditions, including choice of solvent, reaction atmosphere, reaction temperature, duration of the experiment and work up procedures, are chosen to be the conditions standard for that reaction, which should be readily recognized by one skilled in the art. It is understood by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on various portions of the molecule must be compatible with the reagents and reactions proposed.

      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0148">Step 1: The first step of Scheme 5 is accomplished by converting compound (xi) to the ester (xiii), employing one of the multiple ways known to one skilled in the art, such as treatment with a substituted acetimidate such as compound (xii) in the presence of a reagent such as boron trifluoride etherate at an appropriate temperature in a solvent such as THF.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0149">Step 2: Acid (xiv) can be converted to compound (xv) in multiple ways known to one skilled in the art. For example, treatment of acid (xiv) with a reagent such as oxalyl chloride in a solvent such as DCM gives the acid chloride (xv, XâCl). Compound (xv) can be treated with an oxazolidinone (xvi) under standard conditions to give compound (xvii) (Evans, D. A. et al., <i>J. Am. Chem Soc., </i>112:4011 (1990)).</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0150">Step 3: Compound (xvii) can be converted to compound (xviii) in multiple ways (Baran, P. et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>130(34):11546 (2008)). For example, compound (xiii) is treated with a base such as LDA in a solvent such as toluene, at low temperature such as â78Â° C. under an inert atmosphere such as N<sub>2</sub>. The resulting mixture is added to a solution of compound (xvii) treated with lithium chloride and a base such as LDA in a solvent such as toluene under an inert atmosphere such as N<sub>2</sub>.

      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0151">Step 4: Conversion of compound (xviii) to (xix) may be accomplished by treating it with hydrogen peroxide and lithium hydroxide at an appropriate temperature using a mixture of solvents such as THF/water. If necessary, the diastereomers may be separated at this point via silica gel chromatography or preparative HPLC. Alternately, the mixture may be subjected to epimerization conditions, for example by treatment with LDA and diethylaluminum chloride followed by quenching with methanol or acetic acid to enrich the desired diastereomer.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0152">Step 5: If desired, the desired (R,S)-diastereomer may be obtained in pure form by a series of steps involving protection of the carboxylic acid, separation of the diastereomers and deprotection, common steps known to one skilled in the art. For example, the mixture of diastereomers (xix) can be protected as the benzyl ester by treating with a reagent such as benzyl bromide in the presence of base such as potassium carbonate in a solvent such as DMF. This diastereomeric mixture can then be subjected to purification procedures, for example Preparative HPLC or silica gel chromatography. The diastereomerically pure material obtained can then be subjected to deprotection conditions (step 5b). For example, if RâBn, the material can be treated under hydrogenation conditions using a catalyst such as palladium on carbon in a solvent such as MeOH under a hydrogen atmosphere.</p>

      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0154">Step 1: The first step of Scheme 6 is accomplished by treating compound (xvii) with a base such as sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)-amide in a solvent such as THF at low temperature such as â78Â° C. under an inert atmosphere. To the resulting enolate of (xvii) is treated with a reagent such as tert-butyl bromoacetate to provide compound (xxiii).</p>

      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0156">Step 3: Compound (xxiv) can be converted to compound (xix) by generating the enolate of (xxiv) with a base such as LDA in a solvent such as THF at low temperature such as â78Â° C. under an inert atmosphere and further treatment with a reagent (R<sub>2</sub>-LG) bearing an appropriate leaving group (e.g., LG=triflate). Compound (xix) may then be utilized, for example, in step 1 of Scheme 8. Alternately, the mixture may be subjected to epimerization conditions, for example by treatment with LDA and diethylaluminum chloride followed by quenching with methanol or acetic acid to enrich the desired diastereomer. Moreover, a preferred embodiment entails the installation of a moiety that may later be transformed to another substituent. For example, using a different reactant (R<sub>2</sub>-LG), such as allyl bromide, installs a suitable grouping for future modifications. Epimerization conditions, as noted above, may also be employed on this compound if desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0157">Step 4: The fourth step of Scheme 6 is similar to that of step 5 in Scheme 5 and may be omitted if compound (xix) will be used directly in, for example, step 1 of Scheme 8. However, if further manipulation of, for example, R<sub>2 </sub>of compound (xix) is desired, the carboxylic acid moiety of compound (xix) may be protected with a suitable protecting group, for example a benzyl group. Hence, compound (xix) may be treated with a reactant such as benzyl bromide, in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in a suitable solvent such as DMF. The resulting mixture of diastereoisomers may be separated if desired, employing suitable conditions such as preparative HPLC, preparative chiral HPLC or silica gel chromatography, and the resulting pure desired diastereoisomer compound (xxii) used in the subsequent steps.</p>

      <p id="p-00458-en" num="0476">The Notch-CBF1 (C-promoter binding factor I) cell based transactivation assay is based on the ability of the released Notch intracellular domain fragments (NICDs) to function as transcription factors in conjunction with CBF1 and other nuclear factors. Luciferase assays were used to measure the antagonism of Notch-CBF1 transcriptional activity. HeLa cervical cancer cells are transiently co-transfected with pCDNA3.1/Hygro plasmids containing truncated Notch 1, Notch 2, Notch 3, or Notch 4 receptors and a PGL3 luciferase reporter vector containing 4 copies of CBF1 binding site. The cells were then tested for Notch-CBF1 activity in the absence or presence of test compounds. HeLa cells, maintained in DMEM (high glucose with HEPES), 1Ã glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin and 10% Fetal Bovine serum, were transiently transfected in a T175 Flask (4.5Ã10<sup>6 </sup>cells/flask) using the Monster Transfection Kit (Minis #MIR2906) according to manufacturers specifications.

      <p id="p-00464-en" num="0480">Compounds administered parenterally enter the blood stream and undergo one or more passes through the liver. Compounds that are not readily metabolized by the liver can be administered at therapeutically effective plasma levels for therapeutically effective periods of time.</p>
      <p id="p-00465-en" num="0481">Orally administered compounds typically are absorbed through the intestinal walls into the blood stream and undergo a first pass through the liver. Compounds that are not readily metabolized in this first pass through the liver can be distributed to other areas of the body in therapeutically effective amounts.</p>
      <p id="p-00466-en" num="0482">The metabolic stability assay evaluated CYP-mediated metabolic stability in vitro using human, rat, mouse, dog, and/or monkey microsomes after a ten-minute incubation. Each compound was tested in duplicate.</p>
      <p id="p-00467-en" num="0483">The results of these assays were expressed as the fraction of parent compound remaining in the reaction mixture after a ten-minute incubation (Percent Remaining) In general, these results were used to evaluate only the extent of CYP-mediated, or NADPH-dependent, metabolism of the test compound. When the compound was significantly metabolized (&lt;40-50% remaining), this indicated high clearance of the compound in vivo due to CYP-mediated metabolism. However, if the compound demonstrated moderate (50-80%) or low (&gt;85%) metabolism in these in vitro assays, high clearance was still possible in vivo via other metabolism and elimination pathways.</p>
      <p id="p-00468-en" num="0484">The percent remaining results of these assays was predictive of compound clearance in vivo, assuming that CYP-mediated metabolism was a predominant elimination pathway. In different microsomal species, the ranges of results were approximately as shown in Table 3.</p>

      <p id="p-00471-en" num="0486">Test compound was received as a 3.5 mM stock solution in 100 percent DMSO. The test compound was diluted to create a 50 Î¼M acetonitrile (ACN) solution containing 1.4% DMSO, which was then used as a 100Ã stock for incubation with microsomes. Each compound was tested in duplicate separately in each of three species in the Metabolic Stability-Human, Rat, and Mouse assay suite or as individual species in the Metabolic Stability-Dog or Metabolic Stability-Monkey suites. Compound, NADPH, and liver microsome solutions were combined for incubation in three steps:</p>
      <p id="p-00472-en" num="0487">1. 152 Î¼l of liver microsome suspension, protein concentration of 1.1 mg/ml in 100 mM NaP<sub>i</sub>, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>buffer, was pre-warmed at 37Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00473-en" num="0488">2. 1.7 Î¼l of 50 Î¼M compound (98.6% ACN, 1.4% DMSO) was added to the same tube and pre-incubated at 37Â° C. for 5 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00474-en" num="0489">3. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 17 Î¼l of pre-warmed 10 mM NADPH solution in 100 mM NaP<sub>i</sub>, pH 7.4.</p>
      <p id="p-00475-en" num="0490">The reaction components were mixed well, and 75 Î¼l of the reaction mixture was immediately transferred into 150 Î¼l quench/stop solution (zero-time point, T<sub>0</sub>). Reactions were incubated at 37Â° C. for 10 minutes and then an additional 75 Î¼l aliquot was transferred into 150 Î¼l quench solution. Acetonitrile containing 100 Î¼M DMN (a UV standard for injection quality control), was used as the quench solution to terminate metabolic reactions.</p>
      <p id="p-00476-en" num="0491">Quenched mixtures were centrifuged at 1500 rpm (Ë500Ãg) in an ALLEGRAÂ® X-12 centrifuge, SX4750 rotor (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, Calif.) for fifteen minutes to pellet denatured microsomes. A volume of 90 Î¼l of supernatant extract, containing the mixture of parent compound and its metabolites, was then transferred to a separate 96-well plate for UV-LC/MS-MS analysis to determine the percent of parent compound that remained in the mixture.</p>

Compound solutions at a concentration of 20 Î¼M in 1:1 methanol:water were infused at a flow rate of 90 Î¼L/min, then combined with the mobile phase at a flow rate of 50 Î¼L/min before being introduced into the source. All compounds were optimized first using mobile phase A and B (50% A and 50% B), and if necessary, using mobile phase C and D (also with a 50:50 composition). The optimized parameters, including polarity, SRM transition and collision energy, were stored in a MICROSOFT ACCESSÂ® database.</p>
      <p id="p-00483-en" num="0496">The mass spectrometric conditions obtained from automated infusion were used to analyze incubation samples from the Metabolic Stability assay. The injection volume was 5 Î¼l and the flow rate was 0.8 ml/min. The gradient used was shown in the table below. All samples were injected with the gradient using mobile phase A and B first. If necessary (for instance, for chromatographic reasons), samples were re-injected with the same gradient, but using mobile phase C and D. All LC-MS/MS analysis parameters were captured electronically in the raw data files.</p>

      <p id="p-00488-en" num="0499">The rate of metabolism and half-life determined in vitro in human or animal liver microsomes was used to determine intrinsic clearance (CL<sub>int</sub>) and hepatic clearance (CLh,b) of a compound. These parameters were useful for predicting in vivo human clearance, which defines the level of drug exposure in vivo (Obach et al., 1997, 1999).</p>
      <p id="p-00489-en" num="0500">The metabolic stability half-life assay panel evaluates the time-course and the rate of CYP-mediated (NADPH-dependent) metabolism in vitro in human, rat, mouse, dog and monkey microsomes. The time course spans a 45 minute incubation, and includes 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 minute time-points, at each of which the amount of test compound remaining in the mixture was measured.</p>
      <heading id="h-00189-en" level="2">Result Interpretation Guideline</heading>
      <p id="p-00490-en" num="0501">The results of the metabolic stability half-life assay are expressed as a half-life (T<sub>1/2</sub>, min). In general, these results should be used to evaluate only the extent of CYP-mediated, or NADPH-dependent, metabolism of the test compound. When the compound was significantly metabolized (T<sub>1/2</sub>&lt;14 minutes), this indicated high clearance in vivo due to CYP-mediated metabolism. However, if the compound demonstrated moderate (14-70 minutes) or low (&gt;70 minutes) metabolism in these in vitro assays, high clearance was still possible in vivo via other metabolism and elimination pathways.</p>
      <p id="p-00491-en" num="0502">The results of these assays were predictive of compound clearance in vivo, assuming that CYP-mediated metabolism was a predominant elimination pathway. In human microsomes, the ranges of results were approximately as shown in the following table.</p>

      <p id="p-00506-en" num="0513">The required numbers of animals needed to detect a meaningful response were pooled at the start of the experiment and each was given a subcutaneous implant of a tumor fragment (Ë20 mg) with a 13-gauge trocar. Tumors were allowed to grow to the pre-determined size window (tumors outside the range were excluded) and animals were evenly distributed to various treatment and control groups. There were typically 8 mice per treatment and control groups, with the exception of experiments conducted in the SAL-IGF (this is not included in Table 10) tumor model, in which there were typically 5 mice per treatment and control group. Treatment of each animal was based on individual body weight. Treated animals were checked daily for treatment related toxicity/mortality. Each group of animals was weighed before the initiation of treatment (Wt<sub>1</sub>) and then again following the last treatment dose (Wt<sub>2</sub>). The difference in body weight (Wt<sub>2</sub>âWt<sub>1</sub>) provides a measure of treatment-related toxicity.</p>
      <p id="p-00507-en" num="0514">Tumor response was determined by measurement of tumors with a caliper twice a week, until the tumors reached a predetermined âtargetâ size of 0.5 gm or 1 gm depending on the tumor type. Tumor weights (mg) were estimated from the formula:</p>

Tumor growth delay is defined as the difference in time (days) required for the treated tumors (T) to reach a predetermined target size compared to those of the control group (C). For this purpose, the tumor weight of a group is expressed as medium tumor weight (MTW).</p>

      <p id="p-00517-en" num="0521">Activity is defined as the achievement of durable tumor growth inhibition of 50% or greater (i.e., TGIâ§50%) or log cell kill of 0.5 or greater (LCKâ§0.5) for a period equivalent to at least 1 tumor volume doubling time and drug treatment must be for a period equivalent to at least 2 tumor volume doubling time.</p>
      <p id="p-00518-en" num="0522">Tumor response was also expressed in terms of tumor growth delay (TGD value), defined as the difference in time (days) required for the treated tumors (T) to reach a predetermined target size compared to those of the control group (C).</p>
      <p id="p-00519-en" num="0523">Whenever possible, antitumor activity was determined at a range of dose levels up to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which is defined as the dose level immediately below which excessive toxicity (i.e., more than one death) occurred. When death occurred, the day of death was recorded. Treated mice dying prior to having their tumors reach target size were considered to have died from drug toxicity. No control mice died bearing tumors less than target size. Treatment groups with more than one death caused by drug toxicity were considered to have had excessively toxic treatments and their data were not included in the evaluation of a compound's antitumor efficacy.</p>
      <p id="p-00520-en" num="0524">Potential drug toxicity interaction affecting treatment tolerability is an important consideration in combination chemotherapy trials. Interpretation of combination therapeutic results must be based on comparison of antitumor activity of the best possible response for the single agents versus the combination at comparably tolerated doses. Therefore, therapeutic synergism was defined as a therapeutic effect achieved with a tolerated regimen of the combined agents that exceeded the optimal effect achieved at any tolerated dose of monotherapy. Statistical evaluations of data were performed using Gehan's generalized Wilcoxon test. Statistical significance was declared at P&lt;0.05.</p>

      <p id="p-00521-en" num="0525">In in vitro studies, all agents were dissolved in 100% DMSO and serially diluted in media/10% fetal bovine serum. For administration of Notch inhibitors to rodents, the following excipients were used: ETOH/TPGS/PEG300 (10:10:80). Notch inhibitors were typically administered orally on a schedule of QDÃ15, 10 day-on-2 day-off, although other schedules had also been evaluated and shown to be efficacious. For example, dosing regimen consisting of QDÃ12, 4 day-on-3 day-off was shown to be equally efficacious as QDÃ15, 10 day-on-2 day-off.</p>
