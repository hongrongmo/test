      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for personalizing prosthetic and orthotic devices. Many specific details of certain embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure are set forth in the following description and in <figref>FIGS. 1-27</figref> to provide a thorough understanding of such embodiments. One skilled in the art, however, will understand that the present invention may have additional embodiments, or that the invention may be practiced without several of the details described in the following description.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart showing a method <b>100</b> of personalizing prosthetic or orthotic devices in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. More specifically, in at least some embodiments, the method <b>100</b> may include painting carbon braid, nylon, co-poly, poly-pro, and/or other common trade specific plastics used as substrates for prosthetic sockets and orthosis (a.k.a. orthotic braces), however, in alternate embodiments, other types and compositions of prosthetic and orthosis may be personalized. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, in this embodiment, the method <b>100</b> includes: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>(a) Pre-Clean with PPG Acryi-Clean PPG product or rubbing alcohol (at <b>102</b>);</li><li>(b) Dry sand prosthetic Braided Carbon substrate with 320 grit dry sandpaper, Mirka or 3M (at <b>104</b>);</li><li>(c) 2-3 coats of High 5 filler Primer (waiting 10-20 minutes in between coats) (at <b>106</b>) Note: Braided carbon substrate would also accept a Primer base coat PPG K-36 product;</li><li>(d) Wet sand Primer with 600-800 grit wet or dry sandpaper, Mirka or 3M (at <b>108</b>)</li><li>(e) Base coat (base color) with customer chosen color, PPG Brand paintâapply 2-3 coats with DBC basecoat, waiting 5-10 minutes between coats (at <b>110</b>)</li><li>(f) Apply clear coatsâPPG 2042 high solids clear/mixed with DCX61 catalyst and 870 reducer (at <b>112</b>);</li><li>(g) Optional step: then apply an inter-coat with 1 or 2 coats of PPG DBC 500 product with catalyst (at <b>114</b>); in at least some embodiments, DCB is an additional prep hardener with catalyst that may need to be applied over the previous coat of 2042; Basically, a form of prep prior to airbrushing artwork;</li><li>(h) Wet sand after application of inter-coats (at <b>116</b>);</li><li>(i) Apply Art Work using DBC and/or House of Candy Color Dyes (at <b>118</b>); the applying at <b>118</b> may include airbrushing and/or hand-painting; and</li><li>(j) Apply clear coatsâPPG 2042 high solids clear/mixed with DCX61 catalyst and 870 reducer (at <b>120</b>).</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0027">As noted above, the applying of personalizing artwork at <b>118</b> may include airbrushing and/or hand-painting. No conventional methods of personalizing prosthetic or orthotic devices are known that include airbrushing and/or hand-painting as disclosed herein. In addition, in some embodiments, methods in accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure may use one or more of automotive dyes, paints, or concentrated colored pigments which may be mixed into an acrylic resin and installed during fabrication, and can be used on orthotic and prosthetic devices (e.g. devices shown in <figref>FIGS. 2-10</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0028">Embodiments of methods in accordance with the present disclosure may advantageously provide an option to a âwearerâ for an opportunity to personalize a prosthetic socket or orthotic âorthosisâ brace that is otherwise not available in the market. For example, in some embodiments, a wearer may provide their individual choice of personalization artwork (e.g. clip art, graphics, personal camera photos and portrait photos in JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIF etc.) for application onto a device, thus allowing a wearer to choose their own custom âtattooâ or personalization.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0029">More specifically, in some embodiments, a file containing personalization artwork provided by a wearer may be modified (e.g. using Photoshop or other suitable software) to create a collage or other specified design full prints by means of, for example, âsublimation printingâ (or other suitable sub-process) on a material (e.g. polyester or cotton fabric for prosthetics and transfer paper custom paper prints to be applied on various plastic types as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> thru <figref>FIG. 10</figref>). A particular size of the material may vary depending on the particular device (e.g. prosthetic, brace, etc.) being personalized (typically sizes ranging in 12â³ sq. up to 36â³sq. have been found to be suitable). In some embodiments, the resulting custom âtattooâ fabric and/or paper prints may be shipped to the wearer or prosthetist to apply when a new device is being fabricated.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0030">It will be appreciated that one or more of the above-referenced actions of the method <b>100</b> may be optional (even if not expressly stated above) and may be omitted without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>

      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0052">In further embodiments, a method of personalizing an orthotic or a prosthetic device may include sublimation of custom transfer paper tattoo art prints, which also may be termed a custom cosmetic treatment. In some embodiments, such a sublimation process may include applying transfer paper art to an orthotic or a prosthetic device, thereby allowing personalization and printing allowing the wearer to make a personal choice or self expression with tattoo art by furnishing a personal digital camera image, clip art, three-dimensional (3D) high graphic images, or other suitable art. In some embodiments, a user may make a selection from a library of pre-selected designs.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0053">In further embodiments, a print is pre-ordered by a wearer, prior to the fabrication process, and is applied by a third party (e.g. orthotist, prosthetist, technician, etc.). The custom transfer art print can be installed onto PolyPro, CoPoly, or other plastic types. The transfer paper print may be laid on top of the plastic substrate while the plastic is still in the oven, and may become an integral part and fused to the plastic. In at least some embodiments, the installation of the transfer paper is done prior to pulling the plastic over the cast, mold or CNC carved foam and vacuum pulled during the clinical fabrication. Such a method can be used at an assembly line in other non-custom manufactured plastic orthotics devices, including, but not limited to: Cranial Helmets, Lumbar Jackets, Arm Braces, Prosthetic limbs, both upper and lower extremity fabricated limbs, Knee Ankle Foot Orthosis (KAFO), and/or Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO). Such processes may be available directly to the consumer, or through a prosthetist who can preorder for a patient by special order through several âOandPâ (Orthotic and Prosthetic) supply distribution centers.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0054">In still further embodiments, systems and methods for personalizing prosthetic and orthotic d may include choosing a wearer choosing a preselected art design or providing an image of their choice. The image may be custom modified by a graphic designer (e.g. by means of utilizing Photoshopâ¢) to enlarge, and/or collage the image to a specific size. A proof may be provided (e.g. email) to a customer for approval prior to application. After approval, the image is printed on a transfer paper, which may be similar or the same as conventional transfer paper. In at least some embodiments, the prints may be a high quality, sublimation full color image. The print may then be shipped in a mailer tube package to the wearer, and installed by the wearer or a suitable third party (e.g. prosthetist, orthotist, OandP technician, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0055">In still further embodiments, a method in accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure may include sublimination of custom fabric tattoo art prints on OandP devices and can be applied onto upper and lower extremity prosthetic (prostheses) limbs and/or many suitable orthotic braces. Again, such methods allow personalization and printing, allowing the wearer to make a personal choice or self expression with tattoo art by furnishing a personal digital camera image, clip art, 3D high graphic images or they make a selection from a library pre-selected designs. The custom fabric prints may be installed by third-party technicians and prosthetist and orthotist, and may be laminated with 100% acrylic resin.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0056">In at least some embodiments, such custom fabric prints can be applied over several substrates of common materials used to fabricate prosthetic limbs and orthotic braces, including, for example, compositions of (or including) carbon braid, fiberglass, or nylon substrates. Similarly, in at least some embodiments, such custom fabric prints may be applied to a variety of devices, including but not limited to, orthotic braces clinical custom fabricated and other pre-manufactured braces. Again, in some embodiments, such processes may be available to the consumer, or through a prosthetist who can preorder for a patient by special order through several OandP supply distribution centers (e.g. SPS and Cascade), and may also be available for pre-manufactured plastic orthotic companies. Devices that this method can applied to include, for example, Cranial Helmets, Arm Braces, Prosthetic limbs, both upper and lower extremity fabricated limbs, Knee Ankle Foot Orthosis (KAFO), and Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO).</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0057">Methods that include sublimination of custom fabric tattoo art prints can also be supplied to OandP manufacturers who may fuse such a fabric over a silicone liner during a specialty manufacturing process. The silicone liner may then be used by the wearer or amputee donned and applied over the residual limb. Such a method may also be supplied to OandP manufacturers, who may fuse a fabric over a silicone suspension sleeve during the specialty manufacturing process. The silicone suspension sleeves used by the wearer or amputee support and attach the prosthetic limb to the residual limb.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0058">In a further embodiment, a method may include: (a) choosing an image for application onto a prosthetic or orthotic device (e.g. prosthetist, orthotist or wearer of device chooses a preselected art design or can provide an image of their choice); (b) custom modifying the image (e.g. a graphic designer modifying the image by means of utilizing Photoshop to enlarge, collage the image to a specific size); (c) determining a size of the image to be applied based on dimensions of the device (e.g. height and width of image to be applied based on the height and circumference of the device); (d) providing the final image to the customer for approval (e.g. via email); and (e) after approval, the print is printed on a suitable fabric (e.g. 97% cotton with 3% spandex, cotton/polyester blend with a 3% spandex, etc.). In at least some embodiments, the material may be permeable to allow for the 100% acrylic resin to fuse and saturate through the fabric when laminated over typical substrates. In at least some embodiments, the print may be a high quality, sublimation full color image. One or more additional prints may be supplied on each order that can be used on their next fabricated assistive device. The method may further include (e) providing the final print to the customer (e.g. the print may be shipped in a mailer package to the wearer), and (f) installing the print on an orthotic or prosthetic device (e.g. by third party prosthetist, orthotist, OandP technician, etc. or by the wearer).</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0059">In further embodiments in accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure, methods and apparatus for personalizing an orthotic or prosthetic device may include disposing a Global Positioning System (GPS) locator in or on the device. Such a GPS locator may advantageously assist in locating a prosthetic limb device in the event it is stolen or lost. In some embodiments, a GPS transmitter chip may be installed by the prosthetic limb manufacturer during the assembly. Alternately, a GPS transmitter chip may be available as an after-market add on that can be installed to existing prosthetic limbs (e.g. by the wearer or by a prosthetist or OandP technician) at the clinical level.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0060">In some embodiments, a transmitter chip is placed onto the prosthetic device and attached with epoxy or other bonding agent or method to the prosthetic limb substrate. Each transmitter may have a serial number and may be monitorable by a third party. In some embodiments, for example, a subscription with a monitoring company (e.g. LoJack) may be activated by the wearer, or by a health insurance company or the entity or provider who purchases a GPS locator for prosthetic limbs security system.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0061">In further embodiments in accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure, methods and apparatus for personalizing an orthotic or prosthetic device may include providing one or more lights on the device. For example, in some embodiments, a light assembly may have a light emitting portion (e.g. LED or the like), a protective cover (e.g. lens), a power unit (e.g. battery), and may be attached to the orthotic or prosthetic device using a bonding agent (e.g. epoxy, peel and stick contact paper, etc.). In at least some embodiments, the light may be a blinking on and off alternating flashing light which is activated only by motion.</p>
