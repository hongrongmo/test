        <u>BACKGROUND</u>
      </b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The search for immunomodulator compounds and compositions has received much attention in recent years as the mechanisms by which the immune system produces protective or adverse physiological responses becomes more well known. The biological pathways involved in stimulation of the immune system, including stimulation of either or both innate immunity and adaptive immunity, are complex and allow numerous opportunities for the development of therapeutic treatments. For example, with the recent discovery of a family of receptor proteins known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) believed to be involved in innate immunity as receptors for pathogen- associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), development of compounds suitable for therapeutic modulation of such receptors has gained in interest. A description of TLRs and their function in the immune response can be found in <patcit id="pcit-00002" dnum="WO2007024612A"><text>WO 2007/024612</text></patcit>. Modulators of TLRs are potentially suitable as therapeutic agents for the treatment of, for example, conditions involving autoimmunity, inflammation, allergy, asthma, graft rejection, graft versus host disease (GvHD), infection, cancer, and immunodeficiency.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Substituted benzazepine derivatives are a class of compounds that have been targeted as immune stimulants. In particular, 2-amino-4-carboxylate derivatives of benzazepines have been recognized for their ability to modulate TLRs and otherwise provide desirable immunotherapeutic responses.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">
      <patcit id="pcit-00003" dnum="EP0825186A1"><text>EP 0 825 186 A1</text></patcit> describes preparation of 2-aminobenzazepine derivatives. The compounds are described as useful in the treatment of immunosuppression, for example by stimulating the production of Granulocytes and Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulation Factor. 2-aminobenzazepine derivatives are described having a variety of substituents including annulated rings, functional groups, and the like. The reference also describes the use of such compounds in the treatment of myelosuppression.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">
      <patcit id="pcit-00004" dnum="WO2007024612A"><text>WO 2007/024612</text></patcit> describes preparation of 8-substituted benzazepines as TLR modulators. A procedure is disclosed for preparing (1E,4E)-ethyl-2-amino-8-(4-(pyrrolidine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)-3H-benzo[b]azepine-4-carboxylate. The procedure involves seven steps, including as the penultimate step the palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction between (1E,4E)-ethyl-8-bromo-2-(<i>tert</i>-butoxycarbonylamino)-3H-benzo[b]azepine-4-carboxylate and 4-(pyrrolidine-1-carbonyl)phenylboronic acid. The reaction product from the cross-coupling reaction is purified by preparative LC. Following purification, an N-BOC deprotection step is carried out using TFA:DCM.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The use of metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions allows the preparation of 8-substituted benzazepine derivatives such as (1E,4E)-ethyl-2-amino-8-(4-(pyrrolidine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)-3H-benzo[b]azepine-4-carboxylate and the like. However, the palladium catalyst used in such reactions presents challenging purification obstacles. For example, where the benzazepine product is to be used as a pharmaceutically active agent, residual palladium waste left after the Suzuki reaction must be removed such that the concentration of palladium metal is within levels that are acceptable for pharmaceutical compositions. An ideal method of synthesizing benzazepine derivatives would, for example, provide product compounds in high yield with low levels of metal contamination. Preferably, such methods would avoid or minimize the use of purification by chromatographic methods. The present invention is directed at providing one or more of these desirable features.</p>

        <u>SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</u>
      </b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The present disclosure describes methods for preparing substituted benzazepine compounds. In one embodiment, for example, the disclosure describes methods for preparing {2-amino-8-[4-(pyrrolidinylcarbonyl)phenyl]-(3H-benzo[f]azepin-4-yl)}-N,N-dipropylcarboxamide (herein "HG4"). It is preferred that such methods allow for preparation of HG4 having low levels of metal impurities and/or preparation of HG4 on a large-scale without the need for purification by chromatography.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In one embodiment, then, the disclosure describes an improved method for preparing {2-amino-8-[4-(pyrrolidinylcarbonyl)phenyl]-(3H-benzo[f]azepin-4-yl)}-N,N-dipropylcarboxamide. The improvement comprises purifying a solution of (<i>tert</i>-butoxy)-N-{4-(N,N-dipropylcarbamoyl)-8-[4-(pyrrolidinylcarbonyl)phenyl](3H-benzo[f]azepin-2-yl)}carboxamide by admixing the solution with a palladium scavenger.

    <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction preferably involves a Pd(O) or Pd(II) catalyst or a precursor thereof. Preferred palladium catalysts are Pd(AcO)<sub>2</sub>, Pd(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, and PdCl<sub>2</sub>(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, with Pd(AcO)<sub>2</sub> being particularly preferred.</p>

    <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The cross-coupling reaction is preferably carried out in a polar solvent such as ethanol. In one preferred embodiment, the reaction is carried out under largely anhydrous conditions.

In a preferred embodiment, the ethanol contains less than about 0.5% water, more preferably less than about 0.2% water.</p>
    <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Alternative embodiments of the cross-coupling reaction are also described by reference to the following publications: <nplcit id="ncit-00002" npl-type="s"><text>Miyaura et al.

    <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">It will be appreciated that, although a wide variety of reaction conditions are suitable to provide the cross-coupling reaction product, certain reaction conditions are most preferred because they yield the greatest amount of product and/or provide a product having the highest purity. In particular, Pd(OAc)<sub>2</sub> and 4,4'-(phenylphosphinidene)bis(benzenesulfonic acid) dipotassium salt hydrate are a preferred catalyst and ligand, respectively. The most preferred ratio of catalyst to ligand is within the range of about 1:2 to about 1:1.</p>
    <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">It will be appreciated that a deprotection reaction is required in order to complete the transformation from a compound of formula (Ia) to a compound of formula (I). In particular, the amine protecting group X<sup>2</sup> must be removed in order to obtain the free amine present in formula (I). Thus, in one embodiment, the cross-coupling reaction described above is carried out with an amine-protected benzazepine derivative having the structure of formula (Ia). Subsequently, the corresponding 2-aminobenzazepine derivative is obtained by deprotecting the product from the cross-coupling reaction.</p>
    <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The cross-coupling reaction performed according to the disclosure creates a crude product that comprises the desired product, the reaction solvent, residual palladium, and other impurities. It will be appreciated that the other impurities may comprise, for example, unreacted starting materials, salts, solvents, and the like. It will further be appreciated that the residual palladium may comprise unreacted Pd(0) or Pd(II) catalyst as well as palladium waste products (e.g., oxidized palladium, palladium salts, etc.).</p>
    <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In some embodiments, the cross-coupling reaction creates a crude product comprising the desired product as well as a lactam impurity. The lactam impurity is believed to have the structure <chemistry id="chem-00004-en" num="0004"><img id="img-00004-en" wi="66" he="33" img-content="chem" file="EP2940009A1_00005.PNG" img-format="png" original="imgb0004.tif" /></chemistry> Formation of the lactam impurity can be minimized if the reaction and work-up conditions are kept largely anhydrous, as described above. Alternatively or in addition, the lactam impurity can be removed from the product. A convenient method for removing the lactam impurity involves precipitating the lactam using a trituration in ethyl acetate at room temperature, followed by filtration to remove the lactam.</p>
    <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Removal of the residual palladium may be accomplished using a palladium scavenger. The palladium scavenger is used at any appropriate stage in the work-up of the reaction. Generally, this requires that the crude product is dissolved in a solvent. For example, the palladium scavenger may be added after the crude product has been clarified by an appropriate method such as filtration through diatomaceous earth (e.g., CELITE®), or after performing a solvent exchange to transfer the desired product from the reaction solvent to another solvent. For example, when the cross-coupling reaction is performed in anhydrous ethanol, the palladium scavenger may be added directly to the clarified crude product. Alternatively, and as a further example, the crude product is clarified and then subjected to a solvent exchange such that the ethanol reaction solvent is replaced by ethyl acetate. The palladium scavenger is then added to the resulting ethyl acetate solution.</p>
    <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Residual palladium is thus removed by adding the palladium scavenger to a solution containing the desired product and a solvent, and agitating (e.g., stirring) the resulting slurry. The palladium scavenger is preferably added in a single batch addition. Agitation is generally for a period of time sufficient to allow the concentration of palladium to equilibrate, preferably about 4 hours. The resulting slurry is clarified, for example, by filtration through diatomaceous earth (e.g., CELITE®) or another filtration agent.</p>
    <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The palladium scavenger should be effective to lower the concentration of residual palladium to about 50 ppm or less, or to about 30 ppm or less, or to about 25 ppm or less, or to about 20 ppm or less. The amount of palladium scavenger used in the purification will vary, for example, according to the degree of purification desired, and the identity of the scavenger.</p>

A material meeting these characteristics is sold under the trademark QUADRASIL™. In one preferred embodiment, the silica beads are mercaptopropyl-functionalized (e.g., QUADRASIL™ MP), and in a most preferred embodiment, the silica beads are aminopropyl-funcationalized (e.g., QUADRASIL™ AP). Another palladium scavenger suitable for purifying the clarified crude product is a composition consisting of porous, spherical, non-functional carbon particles with a high surface area (i.e., greater than 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, including, for example, about 1200 m<sup>2</sup>/g, or at least about 1200 m<sup>2</sup>/g, or about 1500-1700 m<sup>2</sup>/g), an average pore diameter of less than about 5 nm (including, for example, about 1 nm), and regular spheroid particles having a diameter of about 0.3 mm to about 0.8 mm. A suitable material meeting with these characteristics is sold under the trademark QUADRAPURE™ C. In some preferred embodiments, such scavengers will be used in an amount up to 1000 % wt/wt (with respect to the reactant in the coupling reaction such as, for example, HG1), or within the range of about 50-650 % wt/wt, or between about 100 and 650 % wt/wt, or between about 200 and 650 % wt/wt. Alternatively, the amount of scavenger used in purification can be measured as a concentration. In some embodiments, the scavenger may be used in a concentration of between about 10 mg/mL and about 100 mg/mL, or between about 25 mg/mL and about 75 mg/mL, or about 50 mg/mL.</p>

Examples of such materials are sold under the trademarks QUADRASIL™ AP, QUADRASIL™ MP, QUADRASIL™ MTU, and QUADRASIL™ TA, respectively. Another suitable palladium scavenger under these conditions is a composition consisting of functionalized macroporous polystyrene beads having an average diameter less than about 700 µm, such as, for example, in the range of about 450-600 µm. A material meeting these characteristics is sold under the trademark QUADRAPURE™. In a preferred embodiment, the polystyrene particles are benzylamine-functionalized (e.g., QUADRAPURE™ BZA), and in a most preferred embodiment, the polystyrene beads are thiourea-functionalized (e.g., QUADRAPURE™ TU). Again, in preferred embodiments, such scavengers will be used in the amounts (i.e., wt/wt ranges or concentrations) as mentioned previously.</p>
    <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Alternatively to the above-described methods, purification with a palladium scavenger may be carried out after the product of the cross-coupling reaction has been carried forward through further synthetic steps, such as removal of an amine protecting group.</p>
    <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">The method for preparing a 2-aminobenzazepine may comprise further purification steps. For example, after removal of the amine-protecting group (i.e., X<sup>2</sup>), the compound of formula (I) may be recrystallized one or more times and/or triturated one or more times. Other methods of purification include, for example, solvent switch techniques and chromatography. In preferred embodiments, however, no chromatography steps are involved in the removal of palladium impurities from the 2-aminobenzazepines as described herein.</p>

A three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with-a mechanical stirrer, condenser, thermometer, and nitrogen inlet in a heating mantle. Dimethylformamide and 4-Bromo-2-nitrotoluene were added to the flask and the contents stirred until a solution forms. Charged Pyrrolidine followed by DMF-DMA to the flask. Heated the reaction to reflux (96°C to 100°C) and maintained at reflux for approximately 4 hours. Monitored the reaction by TLC. The completed reaction mixture was concentrated on a rotary evaporator (50°C) to approximately 2 volumes with respect to the product. Product isolation was conducted by two different strategies. First, the concentrated batch was dispensed into methanol (2 volumes) under high agitation, or second, the concentrated batch mixture under a high rate of agitation was charged with methanol (2 volumes). In both instances, the resulting batch medium was a thick suspension. Filtered and dried under vacuum at 35 °C.

    <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">The Wittig coupling was performed in toluene solvent. Reactions were performed either at elevated temperatures or maintained at 20-25 °C while monitoring for the consumption of the HF4. The low temperature procedure afforded 87% yield of HF7. The purity was not determined for this batch.</p>
    <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">The general procedure is as follows. To a three-necked round-bottomed flask in a heating mantle with a mechanical stirrer, nitrogen inlet, drying tube, thermocouple probe and a reflux condenser was charged 4-Bromo-2-nitrobenzaldehyde (1.0 eq), Toluene (16 vol) and Ethyl 3-cyano-2-(triphenylylidene) propanoate (1.1 eq). Heated and stirred the dark brown clear reaction mixture for 2 hours at either elevated temperature or room temperature. Reaction is complete when no starting material is observed. Product was isolated by cooling the reaction mixture to ∼26 °C and filtering to remove un-dissolved salts; rinsed the filter twice with toluene. Evaporated the filtrate to dryness as a dark brown semi solid on a rotoevaporator at reduced pressure and water bath temperature ∼45 °C. Triturated with heptane, and stirred manually briefly. Decanted a majority of the heptane before filtering the remainder of the mixture to collect the solids. Rinsed twice with heptane and air dried for 2 hours. Suspended the crude product in methanol, stirring for 30 minutes at room temperature. Continued to stir until all clumps of solids have been broken up, leaving a thin slurry of fine solids. Let the suspension stand in the freezer overnight. Filtered to collect the off-white solids and rinsed twice with prechilled (-20 °C) MeOH. Dried the product under vacuum at 30 °C for 5 hours; continued to dry at room temperature.</p>
    <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">For the high temperature method, the starting materials HF4 and HF6 were combined in toluene and heated to 100-105 °C. The HF4 feedstock containing 6.5% w/w of water. Excess water was azeotropically removed during the initial batch heating. The reaction mass typically developed a black color upon heating to 100 °C. Reaction progress was monitored by TLC (66% EtOAc in heptanes) and HPLC. This afforded yields of about 48-53% of HF7. The isolated yields were largely attributed to low assays of the HF7 product in the crude batch mixture. Improved internal assays (&gt;95% a/a of desired HF7) were achieved when the Wittig chemistry was performed at 20-25 °C. The improved HF7 assays resulted in expedient crystallizations of the product in the final isolation solvent (MeOH) and ultimately higher isolated yields (87%). For the low temperature method, in some embodiments the HF4 feedstock should have a low water content (i.e. low KF value).

Added Iron powder (325 mesh, 6.2 eq) portion wise over 2 hours keeping the reaction temperature &lt; 90°C and stirred the off-white suspension for another 3 hours at 80 °C to 85 °C. Early additions are done at 20 to 30 minutes intervals. After the exotherm diminishes the addition rate can be increased. Monitored the reaction progression by TLC. The reaction is complete when &lt;2% of starting material remains. Isolation of the product was accomplished by cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature and filtering through a celite pad, then rinsing three times with glacial acetic acid. Evaporated the combined filtrate to an oil at reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. Diluted with cold water and adjusted pH to &gt; 8 with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. Added ethyl acetate to the off-white to light brown suspension while stirring. Filtered the ethyl acetate and water mixture through a crock filter using poly pad. Slurried and re-filtered the brown to off-white solids three times with ethyl acetate. Combined all filtrates, removed the aqueous layer, and washed the combined organic layer with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, then brine.

    <p id="p-00119-en" num="0119">A 250 mL, 3-neck round bottom flask, was equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, gas-diffusion tube, and addition funnel. The flask was charged with HG1 (7.0 g) and ethanol (70 mL, anhydrous grade). The batch was agitated (40 min) to afford a clear solution while de-gassing with nitrogen. To the batch was charged Pd(OAc)<sub>2</sub> (86 mg, 0.025 equiv), ligand (377 mg, 0.05 equiv), HG2 (3.96 g, 1.2 equiv), and Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (4.83 g, 3 equiv) while constantly degassing the batch medium for an additional 30 minutes. The yellow suspension was heated to reflux (75-78 °C) while monitoring for the consumption of HG1 by HPLC analysis (IPC 110-C, residual HG1 with respect to HG3: 1.9% after 4 hours). After 4 hours, the batch was cooled to ambient temperature and charged with Celite (1.4 g, 20% w/w with respect to HG1). The batch was further agitated (1 h, 20-25 °C) and filtered through a sintered glass funnel. The cake was washed with ethanol (2 x 7 mL, anhydrous grade). The ethanolic filtrate was reduced to 2 volumes using a rotary evaporator. The distillation residue was re-dissolved in ethyl acetate (14 ml) and reduced to 1 volume. The residue was re-dissolved in ethyl acetate (70 mL), agitated for 30 minutes (20-25 °C) and clarified by filtration to remove the lactam impurity. The cake was washed with ethyl acetate (2 x 7 mL). The collected filtrate was charged with QUADRASIL™ AP (350 mg), agitated (3 hours, 20-25 °C), and filtered through a sintered glass funnel. The collected cake was rinsed with ethyl acetate (2 x 7 mL). The filtrate was sampled to determine residual palladium (192-1). The filtrate was concentrated to 1 volume (7 mL) and re-dissolved in cyclohexane (35 mL). The batch was concentrated to 1 volume (7 mL) and re-dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL). The brown solution was cooled to -20 to -25 °C. A solution of trifluoroacetic acid (14.2 g, 10 equiv) in DCM (20 mL) was added to the batch over 30 minutes while maintaining the internal temperature in the range of -20 to -25 °C. The batch was allowed to warm to 20-25 °C overnight, without removal of the cooling bath. The batch was sampled for IPC (Residual HG3 with respect to HG4). The batch was charged into water (150 mL, 5 °C), agitated (15 min) and the phases were separated. The aqueous phase was back extracted with DCM (30 mL). The combined DCM extracts were basified with 10% NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution (4 x 60 mL, 10 min of agitation for each wash). The combined aqueous was back extracted with DCM (30 mL). The combined DCM layers were washed with brine (60 mL), dried (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 g) and concentrated to 1 volume (with respect to HG1) on a rotary evaporator. The residue (pink slurry) was triturated with ethyl acetate (28 mL, 2 hours, 20-25 °C), filtered and rinsed with ethyl acetate (2 x 4 mL) and heptanes (2 x 4 mL). The HG4 cake was dried under reduced pressure. This effort afforded 2.15 g (95.6% a/a lot# 193-1) of HG4. The HG4 sample was triturated (2 h, 20-25 °C) in DCM (5 mL) and ethyl acetate (20 mL), filtered and dried under reduced pressure to afford 1.85 g (29% yield, 97.35% a/a, lot# 193-2).</p>

Cyclohexane (30 mL) was charged (20-25 °C) and the suspension agitated for a further 1 hour. The resulting pink suspension was filtered and rinsed with cyclohexane (5 mL). The isolated cake (1.15 g, lot# 196-1) exhibited a purity of 95.9% a/a. A 20 mg sample of cake 196-1 was further triturated in EtOAc (1 mL, 1 h, 20-25 °C) and filtered. The isolated solid (196-2) exhibited a purity of 99.7% a/a. After review of the HPLC purity results from cake 196-2, the remaining 1.1 g of cake 196-1 was triturated in EtOAc (10 mL, 16 h, 20-25°C). The suspension was filtered and the isolated cake was washed with EtOAc (2 mL) and cyclohexane (2 mL). The HG4 sample was dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 40 °C to afford 0.95 g (51% yield from HG1, lot #196-3) of HG4. Analysis by HPLC revealed a final purity of 99.36% a/a.</p>
    <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">Table 13 provides a summary of the preparation of HG3 using differing reaction conditions. The main impurity in the crude reaction mixture as identified by LC MS was the hydrolysis product of the amidine (referred to herein as "the lactam" or "the lactam impurity"). The lactam (RRt 1.02, M+ 460) was present in of the crude reaction mixtures ranging from 15-25% a/a. Two methods of controlling the level of lactam impurity in the crude HG3 product are suitable. First, the lactam can be partially precipitated from the crude HG3 product using a trituration in ethyl acetate (30 min, 20-25°C) and removed by filtration. Secondly, the formation of the lactam can be controlled during the Suzuki coupling if the reaction and work-up conditions are kept largely anhydrous. Therefore, lower levels of lactam (5-10% a/a vs. 15-25% a/a) where observed if the Suzuki was performed in ethanol (10 volumes) only. <tables id="tables-00013-en" num="0013"><table frame="all"><title><b>Table 13.</b> Summary of attempted Suzuki coupling conditions of <b>HG1</b> and <b>HG2</b> to afford desired product <b>HG3.</b></title><tgroup cols="4"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="22mm" /><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="44mm" /><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="22mm" /><colspec colnum="4" colname="col4" colwidth="78mm" /><thead><row><entry align="center" valign="middle"><b>Reaction Reference</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="middle"><b>Reaction Conditions</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="middle"><b>Reaction Scale</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="middle"><b>Outcome</b></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">052-1</entry><entry valign="middle">5% Pd/C from Johnson Matthey (Type A5030232-5), K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, EtOH/H<sub>2</sub>O (20-25 to 80°C)</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">0.1 g</entry><entry valign="middle">Complex mixture (HPLC), with &lt;1% a/a of HG3.</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">052-2</entry><entry valign="middle">5% Pd/C from Johnson Matthey (Type A570129-5), K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, EtOH/H<sub>2</sub>O (20-25 to 80°C)</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">0.1 g</entry><entry valign="middle">Complex mixture (HPLC), with &lt;1% a/a of HG3.</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">052-3</entry><entry valign="middle">5% Pd/C from Johnson Matthey (Type A102023-5), K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, EtOH/H<sub>2</sub>O (20-25 to 80°C)</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">0.1 g</entry><entry valign="middle">Complex mixture (HPLC), with &lt;1% a/a of HG3.</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">052-4</entry><entry valign="middle">5% Pd/C from Johnson Matthey (lot# C-7712), K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, EtOH/H<sub>2</sub>O (20-25 to 80°C)</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">0.1 g</entry><entry valign="middle">Complex mixture (HPLC), with &lt;1% a/a of HG3.</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">052-5</entry><entry valign="middle">5% Pd/C from Johnson Matthey (Type A50308-5), K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, EtOH/H<sub>2</sub>O (20-25 to 80°C)</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">0.1 g</entry><entry valign="middle">Complex mixture (HPLC), with &lt;1% a/a of HG3.</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">054</entry><entry valign="middle">Pd(OAc)<sub>2</sub>, ligand<sup>A</sup>, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, EtOH, H<sub>2</sub>O,80- 85°C</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">0.1 g</entry><entry valign="middle">Complete reaction conversion after 1 hour at reflux.

A solution of TFA was prepared in an equal volume of DCM and added to a cold (-25 °C) solution of HG3 over a period of 1 hour, while maintaining the batch temperature &lt; 20 °C. Upon completion of the addition, the temperature of the batch was allowed to rise to 20-25 °C. The completed reaction mixture was diluted into cold (0-5 °C) water. After a phase separation and back extraction of the aqueous layer, the pH of the batch was adjusted with 10% NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution to remove the excess TFA. The organic phase was further washed with brine, dried (MgSO<sub>4</sub>), filtered and concentrated to a light yellow slurry. The slurry was triturated in EtOAc (11.6 volumes, 2 hours, 20-25°C) and filtered to afford a light pink solid. The cake was washed with EtOAc (2 portions of 1.5 volume each) and final wash with heptanes (2 portions of 1.5 volume each). The final compound was dried in a vacuum oven (40 °C, 48 hours).</p>

The Suzuki coupling was performed under the following anhydrous conditions: 1 equiv HG1, 1.2 equiv HG2, 0.025 equiv Pd(OAc)<sub>2</sub>, 0.05 equiv ligand (4,4'-(Phenylphosphinidene)bis(benzenesulfonic acid) dipotassium salt hydrate), 3 equiv Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 10 volumes EtOH, 75-78 °C, 4 hours. The residual HG1 with respect to HG3 after 4 hours of heating at reflux was 1.9%. The cooled Suzuki batch mixture was charged with Celite (20% w/w with respect to HG1), agitated and filtered. The ethanolic solution of HG3 was subjected to a solvent exchange from ethanol to ethyl acetate (final volume: 70 mL). This process precipitated the lactam impurity derived from HG3. The batch was filtered to remove the lactam impurity.</p>
    <p id="p-00132-en" num="0132">The ethyl acetate filtrate containing HG3 was treated with QUADRASIL™ AP (350 mg, 3 h, 20-25 °C) and filtered. The filtrate volume was reduced to about 1 volume with respect to HG1, and the concentrate diluted in cyclohexane (5 volumes) and reduced again to about 1 volume with respect to HG1. The outcome of this process was a solution of HG3 (55.6% a/a) in approximately 1 volume of cyclohexane, which had not been subjected to an aqueous work-up or semi-purification by column chromatography. This HG3 solution was taken forward into the deprotection step as outlined in Example 11. Following the basification and aqueous work-up, the volume of the batch was reduced to about 1 volume of DCM with respect to HG1. The HG4 product was precipitated with EtOAc (4 volumes, 2 hours, 20-25°C). The product was collected by filtration and washed with EtOAc (8 mL) and heptanes (8 mL). This process afforded 2.15 g (34% yield) of HG4, which exhibited an HPLC purity of 95.6% a/a. This sample was further triturated with DCM/EtOAc (1:4, 25 mL, 2 h). Re-isolation afforded 1.85 g (29% yield) of HG4, which exhibited an HPLC purity of 97.3% a/a.</p>
    <p id="p-00133-en" num="0133">In order to obtain HG4 with a purity of &gt;98%, further crystallizations were performed (Table 16). Four different solvent systems were assayed with particular emphasis on examining the filtrate for impurity content and product losses. The best results were obtained using cyclohexane as the anti-solvent, because this filtrate contained the lowest observed levels of HG4 and highest levels of combined impurities. This purification method was assessed on a 10 mL DCM solution of crude HG4 (derived from 2.5 g of HG1, 74.9% a/a), which had been processed through a typical aqueous work-up. Cyclohexane (30 mL) was charged (20-25 °C) and the suspension agitated for a further 1 hour. The resulting pink suspension was filtered and rinsed with cyclohexane (5 mL). The isolated cake (1.15 g) exhibited a purity of 95.9% a/a. A 20 mg sample of cake 196-1 was further triturated in EtOAc (1 mL, 1 h, 20-25 °C) and filtered. The isolated solid exhibited a purity of 99.7% a/a by HPLC. After review of the HPLC purity results from cake 196-2, the remaining 1.1 g of cake 196-1 was triturated in EtOAc (10 mL, 16 h, 20-25 °C). The suspension was filtered and the isolated cake was washed with EtOAc (2 mL) and cyclohexane (2 mL). The HG4 sample was dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 40 °C to afford 0.95 g (51% yield from HG1) of HG4. Analysis by HPLC revealed a final purity of 99.36% a/a. <tables id="tables-00016-en" num="0016"><table frame="all"><title><b>Table 16.</b> HGR crystallization study on lot# 193-2 (97.3% a/a).<sup>A</sup></title><tgroup cols="4"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="44mm" /><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="35mm" /><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="24mm" /><colspec colnum="4" colname="col4" colwidth="65mm" /><thead><row><entry align="center" valign="top"><b>Solvent mixtures screened</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="top"><b>Solvent composition</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="top"><b>Observation</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="top"><b>Observed HG4 in mother liquor</b> (% a/a)<sup>B, C</sup></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry align="center">DCM / EtOAc</entry><entry align="center">1 : 8</entry><entry align="center">Crystallization</entry><entry align="center">82.44</entry></row><row><entry align="center">DCM / MTBE</entry><entry align="center">1 : 4</entry><entry align="center">Crystallization</entry><entry align="center">68.66</entry></row><row><entry align="center">DCM / Cyclohexane</entry><entry align="center">1 : 2.5</entry><entry align="center">Crystallization</entry><entry align="center">28.73</entry></row><row><entry align="center">DCM / Heptane</entry><entry align="center">1 : 2</entry><entry align="center">Oiled out</entry><entry align="center">36.33</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup cols="4" rowsep="0"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="44mm" /><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="35mm" /><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="24mm" /><colspec colnum="4" colname="col4" colwidth="65mm" /><tbody><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col4" align="justify">Notes: <sup>A</sup> 50 mg of HG4 was dissolved in DCM (200 µL) and then the anti-solvent was added into the trial with agitation.

    <p id="p-00136-en" num="0136">Before running the deprotection step a <sup>1</sup>H NMR (DMSO-d<sub>6</sub>) assay of HG3 using an internal standard revealed 1.94 g of HG3 in the treated process stream (lot# 127-2). This solution was subjected to a solvent exchange into DCM by first concentrating (rotovap) down to about 1 volume. The batch was charged with cyclohexane (50 mL) and agitated. The resulting solution was reconcentrated to about 1 volume. The batch was re-slurried in a second portion of cyclohexane (50 mL) and reconcentrated to a residue (3.7 g). This material was redissolved in DCM (37 mL) and treated with TFA. The final IPC chromatogram (HPLC) revealed that the residual HG3 (1.2% a/a) with respect to HG4 (87.1% a/a) was 1.4%. The batch was subjected to a typical aqueous work-up, and clarification through Whatman paper. The collected filtrate was concentrated to a final volume of 10 mL. The crude HG4 product was precipitated using cyclohexane (36 mL) and the batch was further agitated for 1 hour. The HG4 product was collected by filtration and the cake was washed with cyclohexane (12 mL). This effort afforded 1.65 g (106% yield, wet) of HG4 (98.2% a/a by HPLC, lot# 133-1). The entire cake was triturated in ethyl acetate (10 volumes, 16 h, 20-25°C) and collected by filtration.</p>
    <p id="p-00137-en" num="0137">The cake was washed with ethyl acetate (12 mL), cyclohexane (12 mL) and heptanes (16 mL). This effort afforded 1.31 g of HG4 (lot# 135-1). A sample (200 mg) of this material was removed for preliminary testing and the remainder subjected to oven drying. The HPLC purity of lot# 135-1 was 96.7% a/a and the level of residual palladium was determined to be 44 ppm. Therefore, we observed no attrition of palladium during the deprotection step. The final HG4 sample was dried in a vacuum oven (-28 to -29 inches Hg) while incorporating a nitrogen bleed through the oven. The drying progress was followed by 'H NMR. The sample was dried for an initial 48 hours at 40 °C. The temperature was ramped up to 50 °C for a further 48 hours and a further analysis revealed that the sample contained 3.3% w/w of ethyl acetate. The oven temperature was increased to 60-62 °C and the sample was dried for a further 72 hours. A final analysis (NMR) revealed that the residual ethyl acetate level had fallen to 0.46% w/w. Thus, the dried HG4 sample (0.99 g, 64% yield, lot# 140-1) was submitted for final product testing (HPLC purity, residual TFA, residual solvents, see Table 18). An HPLC purity of 98.7% a/a was obtained with only one impurity (RRt 1.13) greater than &lt;0.5% a/a.</p>
    <p id="p-00138-en" num="0138">Final product testing was performed on HG4 in parallel with a sample manufactured using Si-Thiol (i.e., silica 1-propanethiol, 2% w/w, DCM, 20-25 °C) as a palladium scavenger. The Si-Thiol was added in three portions, with a 6 hour period of agitation after each addition. A final charge of charcoal (10% w/w, 10 min agitation) and filtration completed the process. The Si-Thiol purified sample (378-15) was tested in parallel and exhibited a purity of 98.0% a/a. Both samples exhibited a very similar impurity profile and contained the RRt 1.13 impurity at the same level (0.6% a/a). The residual TFA limit was determined to be trace (&lt;500 ppm) in the 140-1 material and all residual solvents were found to be below ICH guideline values. There was insufficient quantity of lot#378-15 to perform testing for residual TFA and residual solvents. Overall, by this method, a 1 g sample of HG4 (lot# 140-1) was prepared in an approximate 23% yield from HG1. The final HG4 sample exhibited an HPLC purity of 98.7% a/a with only one impurity resting outside of &lt;0.5% a/a. This impurity is hypothesized to be the lactam impurity derived from HG3. Analytical testing showed that both the residual TFA and residual solvent limits were satisfied. The residual palladium level rested at 44 ppm.
