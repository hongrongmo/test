      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present application relates to the technical field of medical apparatus, and in particular to a lower limb rehabilitation training robot.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">
      <b>BACKGROUND</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A rehabilitation therapy is a new therapy discipline promoting patients and the disabled to restore physical and psychological functions, and is also a new technique specialty. The rehabilitation therapy aims to help patients to restore the abilities of daily life, study, working, labor and social life as soon as possible, thus the patients can integrate into the society and improve the living quality.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In recent years, gait disturbances caused by factors such as traffic accidents, industrial accidents and stroke occur frequently, and the number of patients suffering from the stroke and the spinal cord injuries is continuously increased. These patients not only need to receive an operative treatment or a drug therapy, but also need to receive a scientific rehabilitation training to help restoring the motor function of limbs.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In the traditional rehabilitation training, a doctor and a therapist assist manually the patient with standing and walking trainings, however such passive training pattern has a large working strength and it is not convenient for the patients to perform training at any time. In view of the above issues, a robot is provided presently to perform rehabilitation training on a lower limb of the patients. When the robot is used, a patient can rely on the robot to stand and to perform the movement training of legs through motions of the robot, thus the robot helps the patient to restore the motor function of the lower limb.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">However, the existing lower limb rehabilitation training robot can only ensure upright standing of the patients, thus for patients at different rehabilitation stages, especially for the patients at an initial stage of rehabilitation, keeping standing upright is apt to cause discomfort to the patients.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Therefore, a technical issue to be addressed presently by those skilled in the field is to provide a lower limb rehabilitation training robot applicable for patients at different rehabilitation stages, thereby increasing the application scope.</p>

    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">By using the above lower limb rehabilitation training robot, patients at an early stage of rehabilitation may lie flat on the bed board to perform rehabilitation training, thus preventing problems caused by no exercise in long time, such as the amyotrophia, and facilitating the later rehabilitation training.</p>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Referring to <figref>Figure 2</figref>, in an embodiment, the linear motion device 3 includes a sliding bracket 31 and a rod 33. An upper surface of the sliding bracket 31 is hinged to the rising bedstead 2, and a lower surface of the sliding bracket 31 is provided with a linear sliding block 32. The rod 33 is mounted on the bedstead support 1, and the linear sliding block 32 is slidably sleeved on the rod 33. During the operation, the linear sliding block 32 slides on the rod 33, to realize the relative sliding between the rising bedstead 2 and the bedstead support 1, and further realize the object of adjusting a working position of the lower limb rehabilitation training robot, and meanwhile, the center of gravity of the whole robot can be adjusted to prevent the robot from inclining, which may ensure the safety of patients.</p>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">It can be understood by those skilled in the field that, the linear motion device 3 may be embodied as a ball screw structure in actual production. Specifically, a screw rod type guide rail is fixed on the bedstead support 1, a screw nut for cooperating with the screw rod type guide rail is fixed on the rising bedstead 2, and the screw nut is sleeved on the screw rod type guide rail. In using, an electric machine is used to drive the screw rod type guide rail to rotate, thereby enabling the screw nut to move linearly along the screw rod type guide rail, that is, the relative movement between the rising bedstead 2 and the bedstead support 1 is realized. Embodiments of the present application are not limited to the above two connecting ways, and other ways allowing the rising bedstead 2 to move on the bedstead support 1 also fall into the scope of the present application.</p>
    <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In a preferable embodiment, the sliding bracket 31 is embodied as a quadrate bracket, and the linear sliding blocks 32 are arranged on opposite sides of the sliding bracket 31, and two rods 33 are provided and are arranged at two sides of the bedstead support 1 respectively. In the present application, the sliding bracket 31 is embodied as the quadrate bracket, to ensure the cooperation between the sliding bracket 31 and the bedstead support 1. In order to improve the stability of the relative movement between the rising bedstead 2 and the bedstead support 1, the linear sliding blocks 32 are arranged at the opposite sides of the sliding bracket 31, and accordingly, the number of the rods 33 is two, and the number of the linear sliding blocks 32 is four, and the four linear sliding blocks are respectively arranged on the two rods 33, thereby forming two sliding rails. Preferably, the four linear sliding blocks 32 are respectively arranged at four corners of the sliding bracket 31. In specific embodiments, the shape, size, and material of the sliding bracket 31 are not limited and may be selected by a designer according to different requirements and these structures all fall into the scope of the present application.</p>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">As shown in <figref>Figure 3</figref>, in an embodiment, the push rod device 4 is embodied as two oblique push rods 42, and the two oblique push rods 42 are arranged at two sides of the rising bedstead 2. Each of the oblique push rods 42 has one end hinged to the bedstead support 1 and another end hinged to the rising bedstead 2. Based on the above arrangements, the length of the oblique push rod 42 is constant, thus when the rising bedstead 2 is driven by the linear motion device 3 to move, the oblique push rods 42 may drive the rising bedstead 2 to rotate around the hinge point where the rising bedstead 2 is hinged to the linear motion device 3, thereby realizing the rising process of the rising bedstead 2. During this process, as long as the rising bedstead 2 can be driven by the linear motion device 3 to move, the rising of the rising bedstead 2 can be realized. Further, for ensuring that the rising bedstead 2 can be raised to an upright position, a connecting line between the hinge point of an end portion of the linear motion device 3 and the rising bedstead 2 and the hinge point of the oblique push rod 42 and the rising bedstead 2 is arranged to be perpendicular to a moving direction of the linear motion device 3 in actual arrangement.</p>
    <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In a preferable embodiment, each of the oblique push rods 42 is hinged to a fixing block 41 which is in parallel with the rising bedstead 2. A groove is provided at one side of the fixing block 41 close to the hinge point where the rising bedstead 2 is hinged to the linear motion device 3. A rotation shaft is provided in the groove, and the oblique push rod 42 is hinged to the fixing block 41 via the rotation shaft. Another side of the fixing block 41 is a solid structure, which can limit a moving direction of the oblique push rod 42, thereby preventing the oblique push rod 42 from moving in an opposite direction.</p>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In another embodiment, each of the oblique push rods 42 may be embodied as a stretchable telescopic rod. The telescopic rod has one end fixedly connected to the bedstead support 1 and another end hinged to the rising bedstead 2. In the process of the linear motion device 3 driving the rising bedstead 2 to move along the bedstead support 1, the length of the telescopic rod does not change at the beginning, to allow the rising bedstead 2 to rotate around the hinge point where the rising bedstead 2 is hinged to the bedstead support 1, thereby realizing the rising of the rising bedstead 2. When the linear motion device 3 moves to a predetermined position, that is the rising bedstead 2 moves horizontally on the bedstead support 1 to a predetermined position, the linear motion device 3 stops driving the rising bedstead 2 to rotate around the hinge point, and then an extending end of the telescopic rod extends outward to increase the length of the telescopic rod, to allow the rising bedstead 2 to continue rotating around the hinge point until reaches the upright position, thereby completing the process of reaching the upright position of the rising bedstead 2. During this process, on one hand, the linear motion device 3 is used to realize the object of adjusting the center of gravity of the robot, and on the other hand, the extending process of the oblique telescopic rods is used to realize the rising process of the rising bedstead 2. In actual production, the above two structures of the oblique push rods may be selected by the designer according to different requirements.</p>
    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Referring to <figref>Figure 3</figref>, the rising bedstead 2 in the present application includes a bedstead base plate 22 hinged to the linear motion device 3, two standing plates 23 and a connecting plate 26. The bedstead base plate 22 is preferably hinged to the linear motion device 3 via a supporting rod 21 arranged on the bedstead base plate 22, and the bedstead base plate 22 is hinged to the push rod device 4. The two standing plates 23 are arranged on the bedstead base plate 23 and are opposite to each other. The connecting plate 26 is mounted on the two standing plates 23 and is movable in a direction perpendicular to the bedstead base plate 22. A horizontal rod 24 configured to mount the bionic leg 5 is provided on the connecting plate 26, and the horizontal rod 24 is arranged in parallel with the connecting plate 26. Rails perpendicular to the bedstead base plate 22 may be respectively arranged on the standing plates 23, and accordingly sliding blocks for cooperating with the rails are provided at lateral sides of the connecting plate 26, and the sliding blocks may move inside the rails, to allow the connecting plate 26 to move in the direction perpendicular to the bedstead base plate 22.</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Two bionic legs 5 may be installed on the horizontal rod 24, the operator may adjust the relative positions of the two bionic legs 5 on the horizontal rod 24 according to the size of the pelvis of the patient by the left-right movements of the bionic legs 5 on the horizontal rod 24. For example, if the pelvis of the patient is large, a distance between the two bionic legs 5 is increased to ensure that the pelvis of the patient can be supported by the connecting plate 26; and if the pelvis of the patient is small, the distance between the two bionic legs 5 can be reduced.</p>
    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">When the bionic legs 5 are not needed, for protecting the bionic legs 5, the operator may adjust the connecting plate 26 to move the bionic legs 5 in the direction perpendicular to the bedstead base plate, to hide the bionic legs 5 below a lower surface of the bed board 6, or expose the bionic legs 5 on an upper surface of the bed board 6. When the bionic legs 5 are required, the connecting plate 26 is moved in a direction away from the bedstead base plate 22, to expose the bionic legs 5 on the upper surface of the bed board 6, thus when the patient lies flat, an upper body of the patient can be supported by the bed board 6, and central axis of each leg just coincides with a central axis of the respective bionic leg 5. In the case that the patient needs to get out of bed or does not use the bionic legs 5, an adjustment opposite to the above adjusting process may be performed. According to the above adjusting processes, adjustments according to the depth of the pelvis of different patients may also be realized by adjusting the movement of the connecting pipe 26 in the direction perpendicular to the bedstead base plate 22. When the depth of the pelvis of a patient is great, the connecting plate 26 is adjusted to move in the direction away from the bedstead base plate 22; and when the depth of the pelvis of the patient is small, the connecting plate 26 is adjusted to move in the direction close to the bedstead base plate 22.</p>
    <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">For allowing the connecting plate 26 to move in the direction perpendicular to the bedstead base plate 22, a driving connecting way is provided in the present application. Specifically, a telescopic connecting rod 25 is provided, and has one end hinged to the connecting plate 26 and another end hinged to the bedstead base plate 22.

The accessory of the hip joint and the first rod 52 together form a thigh portion of the bionic leg 5. In using, the rehabilitation training to the hip portion of a patient may be realized via the rotation of the hip joint 50 around the horizontal rod 52; and the rehabilitation training to the thigh portion of the patient may be realized via the rotation of the accessory of the hip joint around the knee joint 54.</p>
    <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The knee joint 54 is connected to the knee joint electric machine and is hinged to the second connecting member 55.

    <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As shown in <figref>Figures 6 and 7</figref>, a gas spring 582 is further provided in this embodiment, to prevent adverse cases, such as foot drop, from occurring to the patients in training, and to provide muscle strength against the foot drop to the patients through the lower limb rehabilitation training robot, to help patients train the ankle joint 58. The gas spring 582 has one end hinged to the ankle joint 58, and another end eccentrically hinged, via a connecting sheet 581, to a hinge point where the ankle joint 58 is hinged to the foot treadle 59. One side, close to the foot treadle 59, of the ankle joint 58 is a semicircular structure, and the ankle joint 58 is hinged to the foot treadle 59 via one end of the semicircular structure.
