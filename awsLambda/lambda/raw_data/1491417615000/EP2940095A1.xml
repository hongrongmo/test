    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to personal care compositions comprising aqueous viscoelastic compositions comprising at least one viscoelastic surfactant, and at least one hydrophobically modified polymer.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">It is noted that <patcit id="pcit-00001" dnum="WO2003056130A"><text>WO 2003/056130</text></patcit> proposes an improvement on such existing systems and proposes to use a combination of viscoelastic surfactants and a hydrophobically modified polymer, wherein the concentration of the hydrophobically modified polymer is comprised between its overlap concentration c* and its entanglement concentration c<sub>e</sub>. Although the viscoelastic fluids of <patcit id="pcit-00002" dnum="WO2003056130A"><text>WO 2003/056130</text></patcit> have certain commercial value, they contain high amounts of both surfactant and hydrophobically modified polymer in order to achieve aqueous compositions with the desired viscosity. Further, in the polymer, the hydrophobes are connected to the polymer backbone via a degradable group.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">It is noted that also in <patcit id="pcit-00003" dnum="US4432881A"><text>US 4,432,881</text></patcit> liquids are used wherein a water-soluble polymer with hydrophobic groups is used. The polymers that are taught to be used have a weight averaged molecular weight of 200,000 to 5 million Dalton.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The high molecular weight polymers are difficult to dissolve and difficult to distribute homogeneously in aqueous formulations.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Personal cleansing products, such as shampoos, liquid hand soaps and body washes, not only must be able to clean the desired surfaces of the body, but they should also be aesthetically pleasing throughout all aspects of the consumer experience. For example, it is desirable that such cleansers should also provide pleasing experiences when dispensing the product, applying it, creating lather, cleansing, and rinsing the product.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">It is desirable that liquid cleansing products to have a rich and luxurious aesthetic upon dispensing and application. Furthermore, consumers often equate a rich and luxurious lather to the cleansing efficacy of the product. Additionally, consumers have grown to expect additional benefits from their liquid cleansing products beyond cleansing. Such additional benefits include moisturization, conditioning, exfoliation, protection, and delivery of beneficial active ingredients to the hair and skin. Often times, these additional benefits are provided to the consumer by suspension or dispersion of active ingredients throughout the liquid cleansing product that are effectively deposited upon application.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Only low levels of surfactant are typically required to effectively clean the desired surfaces and that the level of surfactants in conventional liquid cleansing products vastly exceeds the required level. These high levels of surfactants are included in order to achieve several desirable attributes including: 1) rheological characteristics that are consistent with the rich and luxurious application aesthetic, 2) the rich and luxurious lather that consumers equate to product efficacy, and 3) rheological characteristics that enable shelf stable suspensions/dispersions of active ingredients.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In some cases, however, it is not possible to achieve the desired characteristics solely through increasing the quantity of surfactant. In these cases, the characteristics can be improved by addition of salt. Addition of salt to certain surfactant solutions induces a structural transition from spherical micelles to worm-like micelles. However, not all surfactant systems are sensitive to addition of salt in this way. Where salt is not effective, a variety of other types of components can be added to the surfactant systems to achieve the desired characteristics. Examples of such components include water soluble/dispersible thickeners that effectively thicken the system and chemicals that can crystallize to form complex three dimensional structures, such as PEG150 distearate,</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The above thickeners tend to be high molecular weight species that effectively thicken aqueous systems. Some drawbacks to these thickeners are that they can be difficult to handle due to their high viscosity, poor dissolution speed, their relatively high level usage requirement and their negatively impact the clarity.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">It is therefore desirable to provide chemicals that can more easily be incorporated into liquid cleansing products that enable rheological characteristics of surfactant systems, that enable suspension of benefit agents and that are consistent with the rich and luxurious aesthetic that consumers demand, while reducing the overall level of surfactant required to achieve these benefits.</p>
    <heading id="h-00003-en">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">High molecular weight polymers are generally difficult to dissolve and difficult to distribute homogeneously in aqueous formulations. Therefore, another solution is desired. More specifically, there is a need in the art for aqueous surfactant based systems with reduced amount of chemicals to obtain a certain viscosity or compositions with a higher viscosity when the same amount of chemicals are used, the amounts being based on the weight of the chemicals in the final composition, thereby further reducing the costs involved in the use of said fluid and/or expanding the applications wherein the compositions can be used. Also there is a need to be able to use polymers that are more easily dispersible in aqueous formulations.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">It has been found that satisfactory aqueous viscoelastic compositions can be produced that do not suffer from the drawbacks of the conventional compositions of the art. More specifically, in an aspect, the invention provides a personal care composition comprising an aqueous viscoelastic composition comprising one or more viscoelastic surfactants in combination with one or more hydrophobically-modified polymers and a personal care active ingredient.</p>

    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The invention generally provides a personal care composition comprising an aqueous viscoelastic composition and a personal care active ingredient. The viscoelastic composition comprises one or more viscoelastic surfactants in combination with one or more hydrophobically-modified polymers.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In an embodiment, the viscoelastic surfactant is of the conventional type and can be selected from amine oxide surfactants including amidoamine oxide surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, zwitterionic surfactants, anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants and mixtures of two or more thereof.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The property of viscoelasticity in general is well known and reference is made to <nplcit id="ncit-00001" npl-type="s"><text>Hoffmann et al., "Influence of Ionic Surfactants on the Viscoelastic Properties of Zwitterionic Surfactant Solutions", Langmuir, 8, 2140-2146, (1992</text></nplcit>). A useful test method for viscoelasticity is to apply sinusoidal shear deformation to the composition and to measure the storage shear modulus (G') and the loss shear modulus (G") at a given temperature. If the elastic component (storage shear modulus G') is at least as large as the viscous component (loss shear modulus G"), that is G' â¥ G", at some point or over some range of points below a frequency of about 10 rad/sec, typically between about 0.001 to about 10 rad/sec, more typically between 0.1 to 10 rad/sec, at a given temperature and if G' &gt; 10<sup>-2</sup> Pascal, preferably more than 10<sup>-1</sup> Pascal, the fluid is considered viscoelastic at that temperature. The definition and rheological measurement of G' and G" are generally described in<nplcit id="ncit-00002" npl-type="b"><text> Barnes H. A. et al., "An Introduction to Rheology", pp.45-54, Elsevier, Amsterdam (1997</text></nplcit>).</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The viscoelastic surfactant is of the conventional type. It is well known that viscoelastic surfactants provide viscoelasticity by forming a different type of micelle than the usual spherical micelles formed by most surfactants. Viscoelastic surfactants form elongated, often cylindrical, micelles which can be described as worm-like, thread-like, or rod-like micelles. Typically it is said that the shape and size of a micelle is a function of the molecular geometry of its surfactant molecules and solution conditions such as surfactant concentration, temperature, pH, and ionic strength. The formation of long, cylindrical micelles creates useful rheological properties. Viscoelastic surfactant exhibits shear-thinning behavior, and remain stable despite repeated high shear applications. By comparison, a typical polymeric thickener will irreversibly degrade when subjected to high shear applications. In an embodiment, a viscoelastic surfactant is a surfactant that forms a visocelastic fluid in an aqueous media.</p>

    <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Other suitable anionic surfactants include olefin sulfonates having about 10 to about 24 carbon atoms. In this context the term "olefin sulfonates" refers to compounds produced by sulfonation of Î±-olefins by means of uncomplexed sulfur trioxide, followed by neutralization of the acid reaction mixture in conditions such that any sulfones formed in the reaction are hydrolyzed to give the corresponding hydroxy alkane sulfonates. The sulfur trioxide can be liquid or gaseous, and is usually, but not necessarily, diluted by inert diluents (e.g., by liquid SO<sub>2</sub>, chlorinated hydrocarbons, etc.) when used in the liquid form, or by air, nitrogen, gaseous SO<sub>2</sub>, etc., when used in the gaseous form. Those Î±-olefins from which the olefin sulfonates are derived are monoolefins having from about 10 to about 24 carbon atoms, and preferably from about 12 to about 16 carbon atoms. Preferably, they are straight chain olefins. In addition to true alkene sulfonates and a proportion of hydroxy alkane sulfonates, the olefin sulfonates can contain minor amounts of other materials, such as alkene disulfonates, depending upon reaction conditions, proportion of reactants, nature of the starting olefins and impurities in the olefin stock, and side reactions during the sulfonation process. Combinations of Î±-olefins are also contemplated for use in the present invention.

As a result, an aqueous viscoelastic structure that satisfies the required rheology profile is obtained using less amount of chemicals than previously possible.

If too many hydrophobic groups are present, the water-solubility decreases. If it is too low, the interaction with the viscoelastic surfactant will become impaired. In an embodiment of the invention the amount of hydrophobic monomer-derived units is about 0.1 mole% or more.

    <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">Because of the exceptional properties observed for the compositions of the invention with the viscoelastic surfactant and the specific polymer, it is possible to reduce the amount of surfactant and/or polymer. It was also surprisingly found that the increased viscosity can be achieved at a polymer concentration that is lower than the overlap concentration c*. The polymer overlap concentration c* is a threshold concentration when polymer coils begin to densely pack in a solvent. In a dilute polymer solution where polymer concentration is below c*, the polymer coils are separated. In a polymer solution where the polymer concentration is above c*, the polymer coils are densely packed. The detailed definition of c* is described by <nplcit id="ncit-00004" npl-type="b"><text>Pierre-Gilles de Gennes in "Scaling Concept on Polymer Physics", pp. 76-77, Cornell University Press, Ithaca and London (1979</text></nplcit>). c* is measured by the plot of viscosity versus concentration. At low concentrations, the plot will follow a linear path and once the c* is reached, the slope of the line drastically increases. For the purposes herein, the polymer overlap concentration c* is measured at 25Â°C at atmospheric pressure in the solvent. Accordingly, in an embodiment it may be desired for economic and environmental reasons to use the polymers of the invention at a polymer concentration that is below the overlap concentration c*. Further, it is noted that the polymers of the invention were found to interact with viscoelastic surfactants in such a way that the combined use leads to increased viscosities at high temperature (tested up to 100Â°C) and pressures (tested up to 25 bara.)</p>
    <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">If the combination of viscoelastic surfactant and polymer of the invention is supplied in a concentrated form, it is preferably in an aqueous, essentially salt-free form. Such an aqueous concentrate has the advantage of having a low viscosity and related easy dilution. Typical aqueous concentrates comprise one or more glycols, such as propylene glycol, so that the viscoelastic surfactant is more easily dissolved in the concentrate. Typically, the amount of viscoelastic surfactant in such a concentrate is within the range of greater than 10 %w/w, preferably 10-60 %w/w, whereas the amount of polymer ranges from about 5-30 %w/w, based on the weight of the concentrate. By the term essentially salt-free it is meant that the salt concentration is less than 0.01 %w/w, otherwise the viscosity becomes unacceptably high.</p>

Particularly when the aqueous formulations or the area where the compositions are used has a lot of hardness ions, the use of chelating agents for such ions was found to be beneficial. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought that these hardness ions tend to precipitate the hydrophobically modified polymer in the aqueous solution. The addition of chelating agents, according to said theory, prevents the precipitation of these hydrophobically modified polymers and preserves the performance of the mixture of these polymers and viscoelastic surfactants in high hardness aqueous solutions.</p>

An initiator feed consisting of Esperox 28 in isopropyl alcohol (16.4 g in a total volume of 100 mL) was prepared. The reaction was maintained in the range of 83 to 87 Â°C, to allow for reflux of IPA, while the initiator solution was added over a period of 2 hr. Following the initiator slow addition, the reaction was maintained at 83 Â°C (refluxing IPA) for 2.5 hours. The reaction was cooled below the reflux temperature, and the reactor was then fitted with a Dean-Stark trap to allow for collection and removal of distillate. IPA/water was removed from 81 to 86 Â°C while the reaction volume was replenished with water from an addition funnel to maintain an acceptable viscosity. Total distillate collection up to this point was 194 g, while the added water was 350 g. Because of intense foaming, 195 g additional water was added to the reaction, and the reaction mixture was then transferred to a Roto-Vap apparatus, where an additional 110 g of distillate was removed under vacuum at 55 Â°C. The weight of the final material after being subjected to distillation was 690 g. This was a pink-tinted, lightly cloudy liquid with a pH of 4 and consisting of 23 % active polymer by weight. <tables id="tables-00002-en" num="0002"><table frame="all"><title><b>Table 1: Analysis of the hydrophobically modified polymers compared with the conventional POLYFLOS<sup>Â®</sup> HM 21.</b></title><tgroup cols="7"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="21mm" /><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="23mm" /><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="23mm" /><colspec colnum="4" colname="col4" colwidth="23mm" /><colspec colnum="5" colname="col5" colwidth="23mm" /><colspec colnum="6" colname="col6" colwidth="25mm" /><colspec colnum="7" colname="col7" colwidth="29mm" /><thead><row><entry valign="top" /><entry valign="top"><b>R7-33-43</b></entry><entry valign="top"><b>R7-33-61</b></entry><entry valign="top"><b>R7-36-72</b></entry><entry valign="top"><b>R7-33-28</b></entry><entry valign="top"><b>R7-33-158</b></entry><entry valign="top"><b>POLYFLOS</b><sup>Â®</sup><b>HM 21</b></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry><b>M<sub>w</sub> (Da)</b></entry><entry>16131</entry><entry>19775</entry><entry>8459</entry><entry>29956</entry><entry>19528</entry><entry>537550</entry></row><row><entry><b>M<sub>n</sub> (Da)</b></entry><entry>2735</entry><entry>3199</entry><entry>1488</entry><entry>4095</entry><entry>2750</entry><entry>13641</entry></row><row><entry><b>Dispersity = M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n</sub></b></entry><entry>5.9</entry><entry>6.2</entry><entry>5.7</entry><entry>7.3</entry><entry>7.1</entry><entry>39.4</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p>

    <p id="p-00144-en" num="0144">These data demonstrate that R7-36-72 can effectively increase the zero shear viscosity for the sodium lauryl ether sulfate/cocamidopropyl betaine mixture over all surfactant levels to levels higher than can be achieved without polymer.

Furthermore, it can be observed that the zero shear viscosity of a high surfactant containing system can be achieved at substantially lower surfactant content by the addition of the polymer of the present invention with the appropriate level of salt.</p>
