      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a method and kit for improving skin health and appearance, and more particularly relates to a skin care method and kit including a dietary supplement, cleansing cream, cleansing soap, and instructions for a dietary regimen.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Skin disorders, diseases, and conditions affect millions of individuals of all ages. Besides being physically uncomfortable and/or painful, such skin disorders/conditions can greatly impact an individual's quality and enjoyment of life. Individuals who suffer from skin disorders can also, as a result, suffer from social rejection, low self-esteem, depression, and withdrawal of social or physical contact. These can, and often do, affect other areas of an individual's life, such as his or her personal relationships and career. Some careers are even directly dependent on physical appearance.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Yet, treatment for skin conditions is very difficult to apply with any certain success. It often involves a trial and error process of attempting various topical treatments, ingestion of various drug therapies, and/or other costly alternative treatments, such as artificial light therapies. This process can be very expensive, consume a great deal of time and effort, and still result in only partial to no success. Treatments that work with one individual may not work with another individual, and an individual can become immune to a treatment that previously produced some successful results. Moreover, for any one particular skin condition, there can be offered a countless variety of treatments, which can confuse consumers.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">It has been put forth that skin conditions and disorders are largely affected by the skin's relationship to internal bodily functions and internal organs, which are largely affected by an individual's dietary and personal habits. Yet, traditional physician prescribed treatments for skin disorders typically focus on either drug therapies, or externally applied topical treatments. They do not typically focus on a particular dietary regimen, or lifestyle practices. One reason is that promoting a dietary, or other lifestyle change as a treatment for a skin disorder is not as profitable. Traditional western medicine is not focused on holistic treatments to health problems. Also, implementing and tracking dietary and other lifestyle changes is difficult. Many individuals find it very difficult to change their diets and are unsure as to exactly what type of diet could be effective to produce positive results with regards to their skin health.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Accordingly, many prior-art solutions treat skin disorders using only one or two types of treatments, which do not address other areas of an individual's life that are likely to affect the effectiveness of the treatment(s). For example, using a topical medication on a skin disorder may only address a superficial expression of an underlying internal dysfunction, which if the internal dysfunction is not addressed, the topical medication will only meet with partial, temporary, or no success. Also, many prior-art solutions do not address use of daily skin care items, such as facial washes, soaps, and the like that may be irritating, or otherwise distressing the individual's skin.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Some prior-art treatments have severe side effects. For example, one treatment for the skin disorder, psoriasis, which is marked by red, itchy, scaly patches of skin, can involve ingestion of drugs that cause liver damage and kidney damage, requiring regular physician-monitoring of blood cells and organ function during use. Other medications can cause severe birth defects if the individual is pregnant during use. Many drug treatments are only effective during use and individuals become immune after a prolonged period of use.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Therefore, a need exists to overcome the problems with the prior art as discussed above and that provides a low cost, holistic solution to treat skin conditions internally, as well as externally, in a singular package and that does not have severe side effects.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

The container <b>102</b> can be a box, package, bag, and the like, sufficient to enclose and transport all tangible elements of the kit <b>100</b> in a single parcel. The exemplary elements included in the skin care kit <b>100</b> are depicted in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> and will be described in more detail herein below.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In step <b>206</b>, the user reads and follows instructions for following the dietary regimen <b>110</b>. The instructions for the dietary regimen <b>110</b> can be provided in the form of a booklet, pamphlet, card, sheet, website page, software application, and the like. The instructions <b>110</b> can include a list of prohibited food items, which the user is advised not to consume, as well as a list of allowed food items, which the user is advised to consume. The list of prohibited food items preferably includes: red meat; chocolate; eggs; desserts, cakes, sweets, and other confections; alcoholic beverages; shellfish; a tomato; and a fried food. The user is advised not to consume any foods listed in the list of prohibited food items, including food items that may include merely a small portion of the prohibited food or include the prohibited food in a processed form. For example, the user is advised not to consume chocolate in any form, even as a single ingredient in a recipe including multiple ingredients. The user can be advised to refrain from consuming any food that contains eggs. The user is preferably advised to refrain from consuming tomato in any form, including a raw tomato, tomato juice, tomato sauce, ketchup, and the like. The user is also advised not to consume any food item that has been fried. In step <b>208</b>, the user follows these dietary prohibitions by not consuming the food items listed in the list of prohibited food items.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The user is also advised to consume foods listed in the list of allowed food items. The list of allowed food items can include chicken; turkey; fish; vegetables; and fruit other than a tomato. The chicken and turkey meat is preferably from a low fat member, such as a chicken breast and a turkey breast, i.e., white meat. The instructions for allowed food items can also include instructions to consume salads, using only a light sprinkling of olive oil as salad dressing. In step <b>210</b>, the user follows the dietary instructions <b>110</b> by consuming food items listed in the list of allowed food items. The inventor of the present invention has found that instructing users to refrain from consuming foods in the prohibited food items list, discussed above, as well as instructing users to consume from the allowed food items list provides a significant and relatively quick improvement in many troublesome skin conditions. In one embodiment, the dietary instructions <b>110</b> include instructions to only consume foods from the list of allowed food items. In another embodiment, the dietary instructions <b>110</b> include instructions to primarily consume food items from the list of allowed food items.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In step <b>212</b>, the user reads and follows instructions for the skin care lifestyle regimen <b>114</b>, which includes a plurality of lifestyle activities. The instructions for following the lifestyle regimen <b>114</b> include instructions for following lifestyle activities, which may be required to be performed each day or other period. These lifestyle activities include: 1) drinking a predetermined amount of water each day; 2) engaging in a predetermined number of bowel movements each day; 3) using a mild skin cleanser each day, such as the cleansing cream <b>130</b> and/or the soap bar <b>140</b>; 4) consuming a single serving of the dietary supplement <b>120</b> each day; 5) sleeping a predetermined amount of hours per day; 6) exercising a predetermined amount of time per day, and 7) consuming meals prior to a predetermined time of day. In a preferred embodiment, the instructions <b>114</b> include advising users to drink eight eight-ounce glasses of water per day and engaging in at least one bowel movement per day. In another embodiment, the instructions <b>114</b> include sleeping at least eight hours per day. In yet another embodiment, the instructions <b>114</b> include exercising 30 minutes per day. In another embodiment, the instructions <b>114</b> include consuming meals prior to 8 P.M. The instructions for following the lifestyle regimen <b>114</b> further include instructions for lifestyle activities that the user is advised not to engage in. The list of prohibited activities can include: smoking and eating late in the evening (e.g., after 8 P.M.).</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In step <b>214</b>, the user consumes a single serving of the dietary supplement <b>120</b> provided in the skin care kit <b>100</b>. The dietary supplement <b>120</b> includes a composition of ingredients that promote skin care health internally (as opposed to, for example, external topical medications), through consumption and ingestion of beneficial vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other ingredients, the ingredients preferably included in an amount that does not cause harmful side effects. Vitamins and minerals that can be provided in the supplement <b>120</b> include vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium, which promotes healthy skin. The dietary supplement <b>120</b> can further include complex B vitamins, which are needed for healthy skin, as well as, proper liver function. Complex B vitamins are: thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), niacin (vitamin B3), vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and pantothenic acid (vitamin B5). The dietary supplement <b>120</b> preferably includes ingredients that promote liver health, as well. The dietary supplement <b>120</b> can further include choline bitartrate, di-methionine, desiccated liver-promoting concentrate, and inositol. Inositol is a naturally occurring carbocylic polyol that aids in preventing the collection of fats in the liver.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The dietary supplement <b>120</b> can be provided in a container, such as a bottle. The supplement <b>120</b> is of a consumable composition comprising one or more of the ingredients described above. The consumable composition can be provided in the form of, for example, a pill, a tablet, a capsule, and/or a powder or granules, with each serving of the consumable composition effective to promote skin health. The consumable composition is preferably provided in individual separate servings such that a single serving of the composition can be easily consumed daily by the user. One exemplary embodiment of the dietary supplement <b>120</b> in accordance with the present invention is a bottle of capsules, each capsule containing an effective amount of complex B vitamins, choline bitartrate, di-methionine, desiccated liver concentrate and inositol, with instructions to consume a single capsule each day.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The skin care kit <b>100</b> also includes an externally applied component regimen. Even if the user is provided with instructions for an internal component regimen that includes a dietary program <b>110</b> of prohibited foods and supplements that promote skin health, the user may still yet continue to use externally applied skin products that irritate or are otherwise harmful to the user's skin. Accordingly, the skin care kit <b>100</b> includes gentle, nourishing face and body skin cleansers, such as the exemplary cleansing cream <b>130</b> and soap bar <b>140</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In step <b>216</b>, the user cleanses his or her skin with the cleansing cream <b>130</b>. The cleansing cream <b>130</b> is preferably used by the user once in the morning and once in the evening, instead of the user's normal daily facial cleanser. The cleansing cream <b>130</b> can be applied to the user's face, massaged into the skin, and removed with a wash cloth and water. The cleansing cream <b>130</b> is preferably of a moisturizing cream that prevents dry skin conditions, such as, for example, dry scaly skin patches from psoriasis. The cleansing cream <b>130</b> is preferably devoid of skin irritants, such as irritating fragrances, dyes, and preservatives. The cleansing cream <b>130</b> can include a plurality of moisturizing oils, such as for example, coconut oil, sunflower oil, and sweet almond oil. Coconut oil prevents dry, flaking skin by improving the moisture and lipid content of the skin, nourishing skin tissue, eliminating dead skin cells, providing antibacterial properties, and soothing irritated skin. Sunflower oil includes a very high content of vitamins E, A, C and D, all of which have skin protective qualities. Almond oil is also moisturizing, having high vitamin E content, without being pore clogging. The cleansing cream <b>130</b> can be made in accordance with methods and apparatuses known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In step <b>218</b>, the user cleanses his or her skin with the soap bar <b>140</b>. The soap bar <b>140</b> is preferably used by the user at least once per day to cleanse the user's body, instead of the user's normal daily body cleanser. The soap bar <b>140</b> can be applied to the user's body, massaged into the skin, and rinsed with water. The soap bar <b>140</b> is preferably devoid of skin irritants, such as irritating fragrances, dyes, and preservatives. The soap bar <b>140</b> can include a plurality of moisturizing oils, such as for example, coconut oil, palm oil, canola oil, olive oil, and castor seed oil. The soap bar <b>140</b> preferably includes chamomile and aloe vera extract. Chamomile is soothing to the skin. Chamomile includes flavonoid and essential oils that possess significant anti-inflammatory properties. Aloe vera possesses healing and anti-bacterial properties. Aloe vera has amino acids, enzymes, proteins, vitamins, and minerals that nourish the skin. The soap bar <b>140</b> can be made in accordance with methods and apparatuses known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In step <b>220</b>, the user reads and follows instructions for completing the skin care regimen compliance report <b>150</b>. The user is preferably instructed to complete a single compliance report <b>150</b> each day. This provides the psychological benefit of reinforcing daily compliance and provides a measure of accountability to increase the likelihood of daily compliance by the user. It also allows the user to more accurately assess his or her compliance with the regimen using objective data. The term âcompliance report,â as used herein, is intended to indicate a printed document or software application that displays a list of features of the dietary and lifestyle regimen <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> of the present invention to the user, with corresponding fields in which the user can input data regarding the user's compliance with each of the dietary and lifestyle regimen features <b>110</b>, <b>114</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The compliance report <b>150</b> can be provided in the form of a booklet, pamphlet, card, sheet, website page, other software application interface, and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the compliance report <b>150</b> is provided as a single sheet of paper. The kit <b>100</b> preferably includes a multitude of compliance reports <b>150</b> that can be completed by the user each day. The sheet can include a pre-printed list of each of the features of the dietary and lifestyle regimen <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> of the present invention and a corresponding compliance data field, such as fill-in bubbles, for each feature. One embodiment of the compliance report <b>150</b> can include an identification area in which the user can enter his or her name, the date of the report, and any other identifying information, such as a subject number, if the user is participating in a study.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The compliance report <b>150</b> can also include a list of each of the prohibited foods, a list of the allowed foods, and a list of required lifestyle activities. A plurality of fill-in bubbles can be provided beside each prohibited and allowed food item, wherein each successive fill-in bubble represents an increasing number of portions, or servings of the food item consumed by the user on the reporting day. In one embodiment, there can be provided five bubbles. The first bubble represents zero servings of the food item consumed. The second bubble represents one serving of the food item consumed. The third bubble represents two servings of the food item consumed. The fourth bubble represents three servings of the food item consumed. And the fifth bubble represents four or more servings of the food item consumed. The user is instructed to mark the bubble that indicates the number of servings of the prohibited or allowed food item consumed on the reporting day.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In a like manner, a plurality of fill-in-bubbles can be provided beside each lifestyle activity, wherein each successive fill-in bubble represents an increasing number of predetermined measurable increments of the lifestyle activity performed by the user on the reporting day. For example, the lifestyle activities can include: hours slept by the user, minutes of exercise, number of dietary supplement <b>120</b> servings consumed, and number of times the cleansing cream <b>130</b> is used.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In one embodiment of the present invention, a compliance rating feature is included to provide the user with objective criteria for assessing his or her compliance. The compliance rating feature can include instructions for determining a level of compliance with the dietary and lifestyle skin care regimen <b>110</b>, <b>114</b>. More specifically, a total number of serving of prohibited and allowed food items consumed by the user and a total amount of time in which the user performs the plurality of lifestyle activities determines the user's level of compliance. The compliance report <b>150</b> can include a compliance rating chart or table that provides a rating scheme for determining a high level of compliance, a moderate level of compliance, and non-compliance by the user. For example, if 0 to 6 servings of prohibited food items are consumed on the reporting day, the chart can indicate a high level of compliance. If 7 to 10 servings of prohibited food items are consumed on the reporting day, the chart can indicate a moderate compliance level. If more than 10 servings of prohibited food items are consumed on the reporting day, the chart can indicate non-compliance of the regimen by the user for the reporting day. In a similar manner, for allowed foods, the chart can indicate high, moderate, and no compliance ranges of servings of allowed foods consumed. For example, if 13 to 17 servings of allowed foods are consumed on the reporting day, the chart can indicate a high level of compliance. If 12 to 10 servings of allowed foods are consumed on the reporting day, the chart can indicate a moderate level of compliance. If less than 10 servings of allowed foods are consumed on the reporting day, the chart can indicate non-compliance of the regimen by the user for the reporting day. In a similar manner, for lifestyle activities, the chart can indicate high, moderate, and no compliance ranges of measurable increments of lifestyle activities performed by the user on the reporting day. For example, if the user's activities fall in the range of 32 to 51, the chart can indicate a high level of compliance. If the user's activities fall in the range of 31 to 26, the chart can indicate a moderate level of compliance. If the user's activities are less than 31, the chart can indicate non-compliance of the regimen by the user for the reporting day.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Instructions for completing the compliance report <b>150</b> can be provided in the form of a booklet, pamphlet, card, sheet, website page, software application, and the like. The instructions can provide a detailed explanation of how the user can complete the compliance report <b>150</b>, what the compliance report <b>150</b> indicates or means, and how to determine the user's level of compliance in accordance with the compliance rating chart.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Although the compliance report <b>150</b> and the instructions for following the dietary and lifestyle regimens <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> of the present invention have been described herein primarily as printed paper documents, the report and instructions can be implemented by a software application. The software application can include computer code stored in a memory and processed by a processor of a computer to be displayed on a computer display. In a software embodiment, for example, the instructions for following the dietary and lifestyle regimens <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> can be displayed on a webpage, presented by a browser, on a display of the computer, such as a mobile electronic device or smartphone. Similarly, the compliance report <b>150</b> can be displayed on a computer display. The user can input compliance report data for a particular report day via a user computer input device, such as a keyboard, touchpad, mouse, and the like. The user input data is then stored in a memory, or in a database located at a server. In this manner, i.e., storing in a digital format accessible by a computer (as opposed to a paper format), compliance report data collected over a period of time can be more readily tracked and analyzed by the computer processor. The software may include instructions for analyzing collected compliance report data and displaying the analyzed data as a chart or graph on the display, showing, for example, changing levels of compliance over a period of time.</p>

      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0056">In one embodiment of the present invention, a coaching subscription form <b>116</b> is included in the skin care kit <b>100</b>. The coaching subscription form <b>116</b> can be provided in the form of a booklet, pamphlet, card, sheet, website page, software application, and the like. In <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the coaching subscription form <b>116</b> is formed as a sheet that the user can fill-in with information, such as a user name, a password, and user contact information. The user can submit the filled-out form in order to obtain a subscription that gives the user access to a care center for a period of time. The user may pay a predetermined amount in order to subscribe to care center access for the period of time. The care center can be a location within a physical building that houses a plurality of care center operators that are trained to answer questions regarding the dietary and lifestyle regimen. One of the drawbacks of following a dietary program that restricts the type of foods that may be consumed by the dieter is that the dieter may not be certain whether a particular food item is prohibited or allowed at any given moment. Accordingly, it is advantageous to provide a subscription to a care center service, in which users may call in at any time and receive advice about the dietary and lifestyle regimen, such as, whether a particular food item is allowed or prohibited. In another embodiment, the care center can be a website in which users can log-in and receive online advice by email correspondence or online, real-time advice from a care center operator through the website by, for example, a text-based and/or video-based chat room.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0057">The skin care kit <b>100</b> provides several advantages over the current art. The ingredients and dietary and lifestyle regimens <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> provided by the kit <b>100</b> include gentle, yet effective treatments for even the more severe skin conditions. In many cases, results are seen within 10 days of compliance and substantial improvements in the appearance of the troublesome skin condition can occur within a few months of compliance, without the need for costly and time consuming medical treatment. The compliance report <b>150</b>, including the compliance rating chart, provides a tool for accountability and self-assessment to encourage and reinforce compliance with the dietary and lifestyle changes required to improve the user's skin health and appearance, which may be difficult to adhere to for some individuals. By providing a compliance rating system, users receive a psychological reinforcement to continue the beneficial skin improvement behaviors. Importantly, the skin care kit <b>100</b> provides both internal and external components within a singular package, container, or unit, which provides convenience for users that are bombarded with a myriad of potential skin care choices. By providing all of the internal and external components in the form of a kit <b>100</b> users can receive the psychological relief that everything they need is in one location.</p>
