      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">Phototherapy has recently been recognized as having wide range of applications in both the medical, cosmetic and dental fields for use in surgeries, therapies and examinations. For example, phototherapy has been developed to treat cancers and tumors, to treat skin conditions, to disinfect target sites as an antimicrobial treatment, and to promote wound healing.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Known phototherapy techniques include photodynamic therapy which involves systemic administration or uptake of a photosensitive agent or chromophore into the diseased or injured tissue, followed by site-specific application of activating light. Other types of phototherapy include the use of light alone at specific wavelengths to target tissue using light-emitting diode (LED) or fluorescent lamps, or lasers.</p>

      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">(3) Biophotonic Compositions</heading>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The present disclosure provides biophotonic compositions. Biophotonic compositions are compositions that, in a broad sense, comprise chromophore(s) which are activated by light and accelerate the dispersion of light energy, which leads to light carrying on a therapeutic effect on its own, and/or to the photochemical activation of other agents contained in the composition (e.g., the break-down of an oxygen-releasing agent when such agent is present in the composition or at the treatment site, leading to the formation of oxygen radicals, such as singlet oxygen). The biophotonic compositions of the present disclosure comprise at least two xanthene dyes as chromophores.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">When a chromophore absorbs a photon of a certain wavelength, it becomes excited. This is an unstable condition and the molecule tries to return to the ground state, giving away the excess energy. For some chromophores, it is favorable to emit the excess energy as light when transforming back to the ground state. This process is called fluorescence. The peak wavelength of the emitted fluorescence is shifted towards longer wavelengths compared to the absorption wavelengths due to loss of energy in the conversion process. This is called the Stokes' shift and is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. In the proper environment (e.g., in a biophotonic composition) much of this energy is transferred to the other components of the composition or to the treatment site directly.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Without being bound to theory, it is thought that fluorescent light emitted by photoactivated chromophores may have therapeutic properties due to its femto-, pico- or nano-second emission properties which may be recognized by biological cells and tissues, leading to favorable biomodulation. Furthermore, the emitted fluorescent light has a longer wavelength and hence a deeper penetration into the tissue than the activating light. Irradiating tissue with such a broad range of wavelengths, including in some embodiments the activating light which passes through the composition, may have different and complementary effects on the cells and tissues. Moreover, the generation of oxygen species (e.g. singlet oxygen) by photoactivated chromophores has been observed by the inventors to cause micro-bubbling within the composition which can have a physical impact on the tissue to which it is applied, for example by dislodging biofilm and debridement of necrotic tissue or providing a pressure stimulation. The biofilm can also be pre-treated with an oxygen-releasing agent to weaken the biofilm before treating with the composition of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Furthermore, it is thought that use of chromophores in a composition to emit fluorescent light provides the ability to fine-tune the emitted light to a far greater degree than using a light source such as an LED or a laser. For example, according to the therapy or treatment required, chromophores may be chosen according to their emitted light wavelength, and appropriate concentrations used to control the power density of the emitted light.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The biophotonic compositions of the present disclosure are substantially transparent/translucent and/or have high light transmittance in order to permit light dissipation into and through the composition. In this way, the area of tissue under the composition can be treated both with the fluorescent light emitted by the composition and the light irradiating the composition to activate it. The % transmittance of the biophotonic composition can be measured in the range of wavelengths from 250 nm to 800 nm using, for example, a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 9500 series UV-visible spectrophotometer. In some embodiments, transmittance of the compositions disclosed herein is measured at 460 nm.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">As transmittance is dependent upon thickness, the thickness of each sample can be measured with calipers prior to loading in the spectrophotometer. Transmittance values can be normalized to a thickness of 100 Î¼m (or any thickness) according to:</p>

Additionally or alternatively, the compositions of the present disclosure have functional and structural properties and these properties may also be used to define and describe the compositions. Individual components of the composition of the present disclosure are detailed as below.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0069">(a) Chromophores</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0070">The biophotonic topical compositions of the present disclosure comprise at least two xanthene dyes as the chromophores. Combining xanthene dyes may increase photo-absorption by the combined dye molecules and enhance absorption and photobiomodulation selectivity. This creates multiple possibilities of generating new photosensitive, and/or selective xanthene dye mixtures.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0071">When such multi-xanthene dye compositions are illuminated with light of an appropriate wavelength to activate at least one of the xanthene dyes, energy transfer can occur between the xanthene dyes. This process, known as resonance energy transfer, is a photophysical process through which an excited âdonorâ xanthene dye (also referred to herein as first xanthene dye) transfers its excitation energy to an âacceptorâ xanthene dye (also referred to herein as second xanthene dye). The efficiency and directedness of resonance energy transfer depends on the spectral features of donor and acceptor xanthene dyes. In particular, the flow of energy between xanthene dyes is dependent on a spectral overlap reflecting the relative positioning and shapes of the absorption and emission spectra. For energy transfer to occur the emission spectrum of the donor xanthene dye must preferably overlap with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor xanthene dye (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0072">Energy transfer manifests itself through decrease or quenching of the donor emission and a reduction of excited state lifetime accompanied also by an increase in acceptor emission intensity. <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is a Jablonski diagram that illustrates the coupled transitions involved between a donor emission and acceptor absorbance.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0073">To enhance the energy transfer efficiency, the donor xanthene dye should have good abilities to absorb photons and emit photons. Furthermore, it is thought that the more overlap there is between the donor xanthene dye's emission spectra and the acceptor xanthene dye's absorption spectra, the better a donor xanthene dye can transfer energy to the acceptor xanthene dye.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0074">In some embodiments, the first xanthene dye has an emission spectrum that overlaps at least about 80%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10% with an absorption spectrum of the xanthene dye chromophore. In one embodiment, the first xanthene dye has an emission spectrum that overlaps at least about 20% with an absorption spectrum of the second xanthene dye. In some embodiments, the first xanthene dye has an emission spectrum that overlaps at least 1-10%, 5-15%, 10-20%, 15-25%, 20-30%, 25-35%, 30-40%, 35-45%, 50-60%, 55-65% or 60-70% with an absorption spectrum of the second xanthene dye.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0075">% spectral overlap, as used herein, means the % overlap of a donor xanthene dye's emission wavelength range with an acceptor xanthene dye's absorption wavelength rage, measured at spectral full width quarter maximum (FWQM). For example, <figref>FIG. 3</figref> shows the normalized absorption and emission spectra of donor and acceptor xanthene dyes. The spectral FWQM of the acceptor xanthene dye's absorption spectrum is from about 60 nm (515 nm to about 575 nm). The overlap of the donor xanthene dye's spectrum with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor xanthene dye is about 40 nm (from 515 nm to about 555 nm). Thus, the % overlap can be calculated as 40 nm/60 nmÃ100=66.6%.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0076">In some embodiments, the second xanthene dye absorbs at a wavelength in the range of the visible spectrum.

      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0077">As discussed above, the application of light to the compositions of the present disclosure can result in a cascade of energy transfer between the xanthene dyes. In certain embodiments, such a cascade of energy transfer provides photons that penetrate the epidermis, dermis and/or mucosa at the target tissue, including, such as, a site of wound, or a tissue afflicted with acne or another skin disorder. In some embodiments, such a cascade of energy transfer is not accompanied by concomitant generation of heat. In some other embodiments, the cascade of energy transfer does not result in tissue damage.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0078">In some embodiments, the first xanthene dye absorbs at a wavelength in the range of the visible spectrum, such as at a wavelength of about 380-800 nm, 380-700, or 380-600 nm. In other embodiments, the first xanthene dye absorbs at a wavelength of about 200-800 nm, 200-700 nm, 200-600 nm or 200-500 nm. In one embodiment, the first xanthene dye absorbs at a wavelength of about 200-600 nm. In some embodiments, the first xanthene dye absorbs light at a wavelength of about 200-300 nm, 250-350 nm, 300-400 nm, 350-450 nm, 400-500 nm, 400-600 nm, 450-650 nm, 600-700 nm, 650-750 nm or 700-800 nm.</p>

In certain embodiments, the total weight per weight of xanthene dyes is in the amount of about 0.01-40.001% per weight of the composition. In certain embodiments, the first xanthene dye is present in an amount of about 0.01-1%, 0.01-2%, 0.05-1%, 0.05-2%, 1-5%, 2.5-7.5%, 5-10%, 7.5-12.5%, 10-15%, 12.5-17.5%, 15-20%, 17.5-22.5%, 20-25%, 22.5-27.5%, 25-30%, 27.5-32.5%, 30-35%, 32.5-37.5%, or 35-40% per weight of the composition. In certain embodiments, the second xanthene dye is present in an amount of about 0.001-1%, 0.001-2%, 0.001-0.01%, 0.01-0.1%, 0.1-1.0%, 1-2%, 1-5%, 2.5-7.5%, 5-10%, 7.5-12.5%, 10-15%, 12.5-17.5%, 15-20%, 17.5-22.5%, 20-25%, 22.5-27.5%, 25-30%, 27.5-32.5%, 30-35%, 32.5-37.5%, or 35-40% per weight of the composition.

All amounts are given as weight percentages per weight of the total concentration, and the equivalent weight or volume amounts.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0082">In certain embodiments, the ratio of the concentrations of the first and second xanthene dyes in the composition range from 1:1 to 1:1000. In certain embodiments, the relative concentration of Eosin Y: Fluorescein may be such that there is less Eosin Y than Fluorescein such as 1000:1 or 100:1 or 10:1 or 60-80%: 20-40%. In certain embodiments, the ratio of Eosin Y to Rose Bengal is 1:1 or 70-90%:10-30%. In certain embodiments, the ratio of Fluorescein to Eosin Y to Rose Bengal can be 20-40%: 30-60%: 10-20%. The ratio can be tailored according to the emitted light spectrum desired for a given treatment or therapy.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0083">In some embodiments, the xanthene dye combinations are selected such that their emitted fluorescent light, on photoactivation, is within one or more of the green, yellow, orange, red and infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, for example having a peak wavelength within the range of about 490 nm to about 800 nm. In certain embodiments, the emitted fluorescent light has a power density of between 0.005 to about 10 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, about 0.5 to about 5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, or about 0.05 to about 2 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0084">Particularly useful combinations of xanthene dyes include but are not limited to: Fluorescein+Eosin Y; Fluorescein+Eosin Y+Rose Bengal; Fluorescein+Eosin Y+Phloxine B; Eosin Y+Rose Bengal; Eosin Y+Phloxine B; Eosin Y+Erythrosine; Fluorescein+Erythrosine B+Eosin Y; Eosin Y+Erythrosine B+Rose Bengal; Eosin Y+Erythrosine B+Phloxine B; Fluorescein+Eosin Y+Erythrosine B+Rose Bengal; and Fluorescein+Eosin Y+Erythrosine B+Phloxine B.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0085">It is thought that at least some of these combinations have a synergistic effect at certain concentration ratios within the composition. For example, at certain concentration ratios and with an appropriate activating light, Eosin Y can transfer energy to Rose Bengal, Erythrosin B or Phloxine B when activated. This transferred energy is then emitted as fluorescence and/or by production of reactive oxygen species (such as singlet oxygen).</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0086">The synergistic effect may be apparent by the composition having a light absorption spectrum which spans a broader range of wavelengths compared to an individual light absorption spectrum of one of the individual chromophores in the composition, when the individual chromophores and the composition are activated by the same activating light (light having substantially the same emission spectra). This may confer on the composition the ability to be activated by a broader range of activating light wavelengths, for example by white light avoiding the need for a precise wavelength of activating light.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0087">The synergistic effect may also be evident through the composition having a light emission spectrum which spans a broader range of wavelengths compared to an individual light absorption spectrum of one of the individual chromophores in the composition, when the individual chromophores and the composition are activated by the same activating light. This absorbed and re-emitted light spectrum is thought to be transmitted throughout the composition, and also to be transmitted into the site of treatment. This emitted spectrum will then illuminate the target tissue with different penetration depths (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>), which may confer on the target tissue beneficial therapeutic effects. For example green light has been reported to have wound healing properties. By emitting a broader range of wavelengths, a broader range of therapeutic effects can be achieved. The emitted wavelength can be fine-tuned using different chromophore combinations and concentrations.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0088">The synergistic effect may also be evident through the composition having a higher light absorption or emission peak compared to an individual light absorption/emission peak of one of the individual chromophores in the composition, when the individual chromophores and the composition are activated by the same activating light. The ability to absorb and emit higher levels of photons may have a therapeutic effect in certain applications. Furthermore, less concentration of an individual chromophore may be required to achieve a certain power density. Higher power densities can equate to shorter treatment times.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0089">The synergistic effect may also be evident through the composition producing more oxygen species, in the presence of an oxygen-releasing agent, compared to oxygen species produced by an individual chromophores in the composition, when the individual chromophores and the composition are activated by the same activating light. The ability to produce higher levels of oxygen species without the need to extend treatment time or increase the power density of the activating light may be advantageous in certain situations.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0090">By means of synergistic effects of the xanthene dye combinations in the composition, xanthene dyes which cannot normally be activated by an activating light (such as a blue light) can be activated through energy transfer from xanthene dyes which are activated by the activating light. In this way, the different properties of photoactivated xanthene dyes can be harnessed and tailored according to the cosmetic or the medical therapy required.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0091">For example, Rose Bengal can generate a high yield of singlet oxygen when photoactivated in the presence of molecular oxygen, however it has a low quantum yield in terms of emitted fluorescent light. Rose Bengal has a peak absorption around 540 nm and so is normally activated by green light. Eosin Y has a high fluorescence quantum yield and can be activated by blue light. By combining Rose Bengal with Eosin Y, one obtains a composition which can emit therapeutic fluorescent light and generate singlet oxygen when activated by blue light. In this case, the blue light is thought to photoactivate Eosin Y which transfers some of its energy to Rose Bengal as well as emitting some energy as fluorescence.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0092">One or more of the chromophores may photobleach during illumination. This can be a visible confirmation of âdoseâ delivery. As the chromophores photobleach, they emit less fluorescence over time. At the same time, they also absorb less of the activating light over time and so the tissues receive increasingly higher amounts of the activating light. In this way, the chromophores modulate exposure of the tissue to the light which may provide a somewhat protective effect.</p>

      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0102">In certain embodiments, the composition of the present disclosure includes any of the additional chromophores listed above in addition to the xanthene dyes, or a combination thereof, so as to provide a biophotonic impact at the application site. This is a distinct application of these agents and differs from the use of chromophores as simple stains or as a catalyst for photo-polymerization.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0103">Chromophores can be selected, for example, on their emission wavelength properties in the case of fluorophores, on the basis of their energy transfer potential, their ability to generate reactive oxygen species, or their antimicrobial effect. These needs may vary depending on the condition requiring treatment. For example, chlorophylls may have an antimicrobial effect on bacteria found on the face.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0104">(c) Gelling Agent</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0105">The composition may optionally comprise a gelling agent. A gelling agent for use according to the present disclosure may comprise any ingredient suitable for use in a topical biophotonic formulation as described herein. The gelling agent may be an agent capable of forming a cross-linked matrix, including physical and/or chemical cross-links. The gelling agent is preferably biocompatible, and may be biodegradable. In some embodiments, the gelling agent is able to form a hydrogel or a hydrocolloid. An appropriate gelling agent is one that can form a viscous liquid or a semisolid. In preferred embodiments, the gelling agent and/or the composition has appropriate light transmission properties. It is also important to select a gelling agent which will allow biophotonic activity of the chromophores. For example, some chromophores require a hydrated environment in order to fluoresce. The gelling agent may be able to form a gel by itself or in combination with other ingredients such as water or another gelling agent, or when applied to a treatment site, or when illuminated with light.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0106">In some embodiments the composition is in the form of a gel, cream, ointment, lotion, paste, spray or foam.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0107">The gelling agent according to various embodiments of the present disclosure may comprise polyalkylene oxides, particularly polyethylene glycol and poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide) copolymers, including block and random copolymers; polyols such as glycerol, polyglycerol (particularly highly branched polyglycerol), propylene glycol and trimethylene glycol substituted with one or more polyalkylene oxides, e.g., mono-, di- and tri-polyoxyethylated glycerol, mono- and di-polyoxy-ethylated propylene glycol, and mono- and di-polyoxyethylated trimethylene glycol; polyoxyethylated sorbitol, polyoxyethylated glucose; acrylic acid polymers and analogs and copolymers thereof, such as polyacrylic acid per se, polymethacrylic acid, poly(hydroxyethylmethacrylate), poly(hydroxyethylacrylate), poly(methylalkylsulfoxide methacrylate), poly(methylalkylsulfoxide acrylate) and copolymers of any of the foregoing, and/or with additional acrylate species such as aminoethyl acrylate and mono-2-(acryloxy)-ethyl succinate; polymaleic acid; poly(acrylamides) such as polyacrylamide per se, poly(methacrylamide), poly(dimethylacrylamide), and poly(N-isopropyl-acrylamide); poly(olefinic alcohol)s such as poly(vinyl alcohol); poly(N-vinyl lactams) such as poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(N-vinyl caprolactam), and copolymers thereof, polyoxazolines, including poly(methyloxazoline) and poly(ethyloxazoline); and polyvinylamines.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0108">The gelling agent according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure may comprise a polymer selected from any of synthetic or semi-synthetic polymeric materials, polyacrylate copolymers, cellulose derivatives and polymethyl vinyl ether/maleic anhydride copolymers. In some embodiments, the hydrophilic polymer comprises a polymer that is a high molecular weight (i.e., molar masses of more than about 5,000, and in some instances, more than about 10,000, or 100,000, or 1,000,000) and/or cross-linked polyacrylic acid polymer. In some embodiments, the polymer is a polyacrylic acid polymer and has a viscosity in the range of about 15,000-100,000, 15,000-90,000, 15,000-80,000, 20,000-80,000, 20,000-70,000, 20,000-40,000 cP. In certain embodiment, the polymer is a high molecular weight, and/or cross-linked polyacrylic acid polymer, where the polyacrylic acid polymer has a viscosity in the range of about 15,000-80,000 cP.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0109">Carbomers may be used. Carbomers are synthetic high molecular weight polymer of acrylic acid that are crosslinked with either allylsucrose or allylethers of pentaerythritol having a molecular weight of about 3Ã10<sup>6</sup>. The gelation mechanism depends on neutralization of the carboxylic acid moiety to form a soluble salt. The polymer is hydrophilic and produces sparkling clear gels when neutralized. Carbomer gels possess good thermal stability in that gel viscosity and yield value are essentially unaffected by temperature. As a topical product, carbomer gels possess optimum rheological properties. The inherent pseudoplastic flow permits immediate recovery of viscosity when shear is terminated and the high yield value and quick break make it ideal for dispensing. Aqueous solution of CarbopolÂ® is acidic in nature due to the presence of free carboxylic acid residues. Neutralization of this solution cross-links and gelatinizes the polymer to form a viscous integral structure of desired viscosity.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0110">Carbomers are available as fine white powders which disperse in water to form acidic colloidal suspensions (a 1% dispersion has approx. pH 3) of low viscosity. Neutralization of these suspensions using a base, for example sodium, potassium or ammonium hydroxides, low molecular weight amines and alkanolamines, results in the formation of translucent gels. Nicotine salts such as nicotine chloride form stable water-soluble complexes with carbomers at about pH 3.5 and are stabilized at an optimal pH of about 5.6.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0111">In some embodiments of the disclosure, the carbomer is Carbopol. Such polymers are commercially available from B.F. Goodrich or Lubrizol under the designation CarbopolÂ® 71G NF, 420, 430, 475, 488, 493, 910, 934, 934P, 940, 971PNF, 974P NF, 980 NF, 981 NF and the like. Carbopols are versatile controlled-release polymers, as described by Brock (Pharmacotherapy, 14:430-7 (1994)) and Durrani (Pharmaceutical Res. (Supp.) 8:S-135 (1991)), and belong to a family of carbomers which are synthetic, high molecular weight, non-linear polymers of acrylic acid, crosslinked with polyalkenyl polyether. In some embodiments, the carbomer is CarbopolÂ® 974P NF, 980 NF, 5984 EP, ETD 2020NF, Ultrez 10 NF, 934 NF, 934P NF or 940 NF. In certain embodiments, the carbomer is CarbopolÂ® 980 NF, ETD 2020 NF, Ultrez 10 NF, Ultrez 21 or 1382 Polymer, 1342 NF, 940 NF.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0112">In certain embodiments, the gelling agent comprises a hygroscopic material. By hygroscopic material is meant a substance capable of taking up water, for example, by absorption or adsorption even at relative humidity as low as 50%, at room temperature (e.g. about 25Â° C.). The hygroscopic material may include, but is not limited to, glucosamine, glycosaminoglycan, poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(2-hydroxyethylmethylacrylate), polyethylene oxide, collagen, chitosan, alginate, a poly(acrylonitrile)-based hydrogel, poly(ethylene glycol)/poly(acrylic acid) interpenetrating polymer network hydrogel, polyethylene oxide-polybutylene terephthalate, hyaluronic acid, high-molecular-weight polyacrylic acid, poly(hydroxy ethylmethacrylate), poly(ethylene glycol), tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, polyethylene glycol methacrylate, and poly(methyl acrylate-co-hydroxyethyl acrylate).</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0113">The biophotonic composition of the present disclosure may be further encapsulated, e.g, in a membrane. Such a membrane may be transparent, and/or substantially, or fully impermeable. The membrane may be impermeable to liquid but permeable to gases such as air. In certain embodiments, the composition may form a membrane that encapsulates the chromophore(s) of the biophotonic topical composition, where the membrane may be substantially impermeable to liquid and/or gas.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0114">The composition may include any other carrier.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0115">(d) Oxygen-Releasing Agents</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0116">According to certain embodiments, the compositions of the present disclosure may optionally further comprise an oxygen-releasing agent, for example, as a source of oxygen.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0117">When a biophotonic composition of the present disclosure comprising an oxygen-releasing agent is illuminated with light, the xanthene dyes are excited to a higher energy state. When the xanthene dyes' electrons return to a lower energy state, they emit photons with a lower energy level, thus causing the emission of light of a longer wavelength (Stokes' shift). In the proper environment, some of this energy release is transferred to oxygen or the reactive hydrogen peroxide and causes the formation of oxygen radicals, such as singlet oxygen. The singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species generated by the activation of the biophotonic composition are thought to operate in a hormetic fashion. That is, a health beneficial effect that is brought about by the low exposure to a normally toxic stimuli (e.g. reactive oxygen), by stimulating and modulating stress response pathways in cells of the targeted tissues. Endogenous response to exogenous generated free radicals (reactive oxygen species) is modulated in increased defense capacity against the exogenous free radicals and induces acceleration of healing and regenerative processes. Furthermore, activation of the composition can also produce an antibacterial effect. The extreme sensitivity of bacteria to exposure to free radicals makes the composition of the present disclosure a de facto bactericidal composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0118">As stated above, the generation of oxygen species by the composition in some embodiments is accompanied by the micro-bubbling which can contribute to debridement or dislodging of biofilm at the site of application. This can allow for the improved penetration of the activating and/or fluorescence light to the treatment site for example to deactivate bacterial colonies leading to their reduction in number.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0119">Suitable oxygen-releasing agents that may be included in the composition include, but are not limited to peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide, urea hydrogen peroxide and benzoyl peroxide. Peroxide compounds are oxygen-releasing agents that contain the peroxy group (RâOâOâR), which is a chainlike structure containing two oxygen atoms, each of which is bonded to the other and a radical or some element.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0120">Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is the starting material to prepare organic peroxides. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is a powerful oxygen-releasing agent, and the unique property of hydrogen peroxide is that it breaks down into water and oxygen and does not form any persistent, toxic residual compound. Hydrogen peroxide for use in this composition can be used in a gel, for example with 6% hydrogen peroxide. A suitable range of concentration over which hydrogen peroxide can be used in the present composition is from about 0.1% to about 6%.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0121">Urea hydrogen peroxide (also known as urea peroxide, carbamide peroxide or percarbamide) is soluble in water and contains approximately 35% hydrogen peroxide. Carbamide peroxide for use in this composition can be used as a gel, for example with 16% carbamide peroxide that represents 5.6% hydrogen peroxide, or 12% carbamide peroxide. A suitable range of concentration over which urea peroxide can be used in the present composition is from about 0.3% to about 16%. Urea peroxide breaks down to urea and hydrogen peroxide in a slow-release fashion that can be accelerated with heat or photochemical reactions. The released urea [carbamide, (NH<sub>2</sub>)CO<sub>2</sub>)], is highly soluble in water and is a powerful protein denaturant. It increases solubility of some proteins and enhances rehydration of the skin and/or mucosa.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0122">Benzoyl peroxide consists of two benzoyl groups (benzoic acid with the H of the carboxylic acid removed) joined by a peroxide group. It is found in treatments for acne, in concentrations varying from 2.5% to 10%. The released peroxide groups are effective at killing bacteria. Benzoyl peroxide also promotes skin turnover and clearing of pores, which further contributes to decreasing bacterial counts and reduce acne. Benzoyl peroxide breaks down to benzoic acid and oxygen upon contact with skin, neither of which is toxic. A suitable range of concentration over which benzoyl peroxide can be used in the present composition is from about 2.5% to about 5%.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0123">Other oxygen-releasing agents include molecular oxygen, water, perbonates and carbonates. Oxygen-releasing agents can be provided in powder, liquid or gel form within the composition. The composition may include an amount of oxygen-releasing agent, which is augmented by the separate application of oxygen-releasing agents to the treatment site.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0124">Alternatively, oxygen-releasing agents may also be applied to the tissue site separately to the composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0125">(e) Healing Factors</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0126">The composition of the present disclosure may comprise healing factors. Healing factors comprise compounds that promote or enhance the healing or regenerative process of the tissues on the application site of the composition. During the photoactivation of the composition of the present disclosure, there is an increase of the absorption of molecules at the treatment site by the skin, wound or the mucosa. An augmentation in the blood flow at the site of treatment is observed for an extent period of time. An increase in the lymphatic drainage and a possible change in the osmotic equilibrium due to the dynamic interaction of the free radical cascades can be enhanced or even fortified with the inclusion of healing factors. Suitable healing factors include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0127">Hyaluronic acid (Hyaluronan, hyaluronate): is a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan, distributed widely throughout connective, epithelial and neural tissues. It is one of the primary components of the extracellular matrix, and contributes significantly to cell proliferation and migration. Hyaluronan is a major component of the skin, where it is involved in tissue repair. While it is abundant in extracellular matrices, it contributes to tissues hydrodynamics, movement and proliferation of cells and participates in a wide number of cell surface receptor interactions, notably those including primary receptor CD44. The hyaluronidases enzymes degrade hyaluronan. There are at least seven types of hyaluronidase-like enzymes in humans, several of which are tumor suppressors. The degradation products of hyaluronic acid, the oligosaccharides and the very-low molecular weight hyaluronic acid, exhibit pro-angiogenic properties. In addition, recent studies show that hyaluronan fragments, but not the native high molecular mass of hyaluronan, can induce inflammatory responses in macrophages and dendritic cells in tissue injury. Hyaluronic acid is well suited to biological applications targeting the skin. Due to its high biocompatibility, it is used to stimulate tissue regeneration. Studies have shown hyaluronic acid appearing in the early stages of healing to physically create room for white blood cells that mediate the immune response. It is used in the synthesis of biological scaffolds for wound healing applications and in wrinkle treatment. A suitable range of concentration over which hyaluronic acid can be used in the present composition is from about 0.001% to about 3%.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0128">Glucosamine: is one of the most abundant monosaccharides in human tissues and a precursor in the biological synthesis of glycosilated proteins and lipids. It is commonly used in the treatment of osteoarthritis. The common form of glucosamine used is its sulfate salt. Glucosamine shows a number of effects including an anti-inflammatory activity, stimulation of the synthesis of proteoglycans and the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes. A suitable range of concentration over which glucosamine can be used in the present composition is from about 0.01% to about 3%.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0129">Allantoin: is a diureide of glyosilic acid. It has keratolytic effect, increases the water content of the extracellular matrix, enhances the desquamation of the upper layers of dead (apoptotic) skin cells, and promotes skin proliferation and wound healing.</p>

      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0145">(g) Collagens and Agents that Promote Collagen Synthesis</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0146">The compositions of the present disclosure may include collagens and agents that promote collagen synthesis. Collagen is a fibrous protein produced in dermal fibroblast cells and forming 70% of the dermis. Collagen is responsible for the smoothing and firming of the skin. Therefore, when the synthesis of collagen is reduced, skin aging will occur, and so the firming and smoothing of the skin will be rapidly reduced. As a result, the skin will be flaccid and wrinkled. On the other hand, when metabolism of collagen is activated by the stimulation of collagen synthesis in the skin, the components of dermal matrices will be increased, leading to effects, such as wrinkle improvement, firmness improvement and skin strengthening. Thus, collagens and agents that promote collagen synthesis may also be useful in the present disclosure. Agents that promote collagen synthesis (i.e., pro-collagen synthesis agents) include amino acids, peptides, proteins, lipids, small chemical molecules, natural products and extracts from natural products.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0147">For instance, it was discovered that intake of vitamin C, iron, and collagen can effectively increase the amount of collagen in skin or bone. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication 20090069217. Examples of the vitamin C include an ascorbic acid derivative such as L-ascorbic acid or sodium L-ascorbate, an ascorbic acid preparation obtained by coating ascorbic acid with an emulsifier or the like, and a mixture containing two or more of those vitamin Cs at an arbitrary rate. In addition, natural products containing vitamin C such as acerola and lemon may also be used. Examples of the iron preparation include: an inorganic iron such as ferrous sulfate, sodium ferrous citrate, or ferric pyrophosphate; an organic iron such as heme iron, ferritin iron, or lactoferrin iron; and a mixture containing two or more of those irons at an arbitrary rate. In addition, natural products containing iron such as spinach or liver may also be used. Moreover, examples of the collagen include: an extract obtained by treating bone, skin, or the like of a mammal such as bovine or swine with an acid or alkaline; a peptide obtained by hydrolyzing the extract with a protease such as pepsine, trypsin, or chymotrypsin; and a mixture containing two or more of those collagens at an arbitrary rate.

      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="2">(5) Wounds and Wound Healing</heading>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0166">The biophotonic compositions and methods of the present disclosure may be used to treat wounds and promote wound healing. Wounds that may be treated by the biophotonic compositions and methods of the present disclosure include, for example, injuries to the skin and subcutaneous tissue initiated in different ways (e.g., pressure ulcers from extended bed rest, wounds induced by trauma, wounds induced by conditions such as periodontitis) and with varying characteristics. In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides biophotonic compositions and methods for treating and/or promoting the healing of, for example, burns, incisions, excisions, lacerations, abrasions, puncture or penetrating wounds, surgical wounds, contusions, hematomas, crushing injuries, gun shots, sores and ulcers.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0167">Biophotonic compositions and methods of the present disclosure may be used to treat and/or promote the healing of chronic cutaneous ulcers or wounds, which are wounds that have failed to proceed through an orderly and timely series of events to produce a durable structural, functional, and cosmetic closure. The vast majority of chronic wounds can be classified into three categories based on their etiology: pressure ulcers, neuropathic (diabetic foot) ulcers and vascular (venous or arterial) ulcers.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0168">In certain other embodiments, the present disclosure provides biophotonic compositions and methods for treating and/or promoting healing, Grade I-IV ulcers. In certain embodiments, the application provides compositions suitable for use with Grade II ulcers in particular. Ulcers may be classified into one of four grades depending on the depth of the wound: i) Grade I: wounds limited to the epithelium; ii) Grade II: wounds extending into the dermis; iii) Grade III: wounds extending into the subcutaneous tissue; and iv) Grade IV (or full-thickness wounds): wounds wherein bones are exposed (e.g., a bony pressure point such as the greater trochanter or the sacrum).</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0169">For example, the present disclosure provides biophotonic compositions and methods for treating and/or promoting healing of a diabetic ulcer. Diabetic patients are prone to foot and other ulcerations due to both neurologic and vascular complications. Peripheral neuropathy can cause altered or complete loss of sensation in the foot and/or leg. Diabetic patients with advanced neuropathy lose all ability for sharp-dull discrimination. Any cuts or trauma to the foot may go completely unnoticed for days or weeks in a patient with neuropathy. A patient with advanced neuropathy loses the ability to sense a sustained pressure insult, as a result, tissue ischemia and necrosis may occur leading to for example, plantar ulcerations. Microvascular disease is one of the significant complications for diabetics which may also lead to ulcerations. In certain embodiments, compositions and methods of treating a chronic wound are provided here in, where the chronic wound is characterized by diabetic foot ulcers and/or ulcerations due to neurologic and/or vascular complications of diabetes.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0170">In other examples, the present disclosure provides biophotonic compositions and methods for treating and/or promoting healing of a pressure ulcer. Pressure ulcer includes bed sores, decubitus ulcers and ischial tuberosity ulcers and can cause considerable pain and discomfort to a patient. A pressure ulcer can occur as a result of a prolonged pressure applied to the skin. Thus, pressure can be exerted on the skin of a patient due to the weight or mass of an individual. A pressure ulcer can develop when blood supply to an area of the skin is obstructed or cut off for more than two or three hours. The affected skin area can turns red, becomes painful and can become necrotic. If untreated, the skin breaks open and can become infected. An ulcer sore is therefore a skin ulcer that occurs in an area of the skin that is under pressure from e.g. lying in bed, sitting in a wheelchair, and/or wearing a cast for a prolonged period of time. Pressure ulcer can occur when a person is bedridden, unconscious, unable to sense pain, or immobile. Pressure ulcer often occur in boney prominences of the body such as the buttocks area (on the sacrum or iliac crest), or on the heels of a foot.</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0171">In other examples, the present disclosure provides biophotonic compositions and methods for treating and/or promoting healing of acute wounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0172">Additional types of wound that can be treated by the biophotonic compositions and methods of the present disclosure include those disclosed by U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. 20090220450, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0173">Wound healing in adult tissues is a complicated reparative process. For example, the healing process for skin involves the recruitment of a variety of specialized cells to the site of the wound, extracellular matrix and basement membrane deposition, angiogenesis, selective protease activity and re-epithelialization.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0174">There are three distinct phases in the wound healing process. First, in the inflammatory phase, which typically occurs from the moment a wound occurs until the first two to five days, platelets aggregate to deposit granules, promoting the deposit of fibrin and stimulating the release of growth factors. Leukocytes migrate to the wound site and begin to digest and transport debris away from the wound. During this inflammatory phase, monocytes are also converted to macrophages, which release growth factors for stimulating angiogenesis and the production of fibroblasts.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0175">Second, in the proliferative phase, which typically occurs from two days to three weeks, granulation tissue forms, and epithelialization and contraction begin. Fibroblasts, which are key cell types in this phase, proliferate and synthesize collagen to fill the wound and provide a strong matrix on which epithelial cells grow. As fibroblasts produce collagen, vascularization extends from nearby vessels, resulting in granulation tissue. Granulation tissue typically grows from the base of the wound. Epithelialization involves the migration of epithelial cells from the wound surfaces to seal the wound. Epithelial cells are driven by the need to contact cells of like type and are guided by a network of fibrin strands that function as a grid over which these cells migrate. Contractile cells called myofibroblasts appear in wounds, and aid in wound closure. These cells exhibit collagen synthesis and contractility, and are common in granulating wounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0176">Third, in the remodeling phase, the final phase of wound healing which can take place from three weeks up to several years, collagen in the scar undergoes repeated degradation and re-synthesis. During this phase, the tensile strength of the newly formed skin increases.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0177">However, as the rate of wound healing increases, there is often an associated increase in scar formation. Scarring is a consequence of the healing process in most adult animal and human tissues. Scar tissue is not identical to the tissue which it replaces, as it is usually of inferior functional quality. The types of scars include, but are not limited to, atrophic, hypertrophic and keloidal scars, as well as scar contractures. Atrophic scars are flat and depressed below the surrounding skin as a valley or hole. Hypertrophic scars are elevated scars that remain within the boundaries of the original lesion, and often contain excessive collagen arranged in an abnormal pattern. Keloidal scars are elevated scars that spread beyond the margins of the original wound and invade the surrounding normal skin in a way that is site specific, and often contain whorls of collagen arranged in an abnormal fashion.</p>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0178">In contrast, normal skin consists of collagen fibers arranged in a basket-weave pattern, which contributes to both the strength and elasticity of the dermis. Thus, to achieve a smoother wound healing process, an approach is needed that not only stimulates collagen production, but also does so in a way that reduces scar formation.</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0179">The biophotonic compositions and methods of the present disclosure promote the wound healing by promoting the formation of substantially uniform epithelialization; promoting collagen synthesis; promoting controlled contraction; and/or by reducing the formation of scar tissue. In certain embodiments, the biophotonic compositions and methods of the present disclosure may promote wound healing by promoting the formation of substantially uniform epithelialization. In some embodiments, the biophotonic compositions and methods of the present disclosure promote collagen synthesis. In some other embodiments, the biophotonic compositions and methods of the present disclosure promote controlled contraction. In certain embodiments, the biophotonic compositions and methods of the present disclosure promote wound healing, for example, by reducing the formation of scar tissue or by speeding up the wound closure process. In certain embodiments, the biophotonic compositions and methods of the present disclosure promote wound healing, for example, by reducing inflammation. In certain embodiments, the biophotonic composition can be used following wound closure to optimize scar revision. In this case, the biophotonic composition may be applied at regular intervals such as once a week, or at an interval deemed appropriate by the physician.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0180">The biophotonic composition may be soaked into a woven or non-woven material or a sponge and applied as a wound dressing. A light source, such as LEDs or waveguides, may be provided within or adjacent the wound dressing or the composition to illuminate the composition. The waveguides can be optical fibres which can transmit light, not only from their ends, but also from their body. For example, made of polycarbonate or polymethylmethacrylate.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0181">Adjunct therapies which may be topical or systemic such as antibiotic treatment may also be used. Negative pressure assisted wound closure can also be used to assist wound closure and/or to remove the composition.</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="2">(6) Acne and Acne Scars</heading>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0182">The biophotonic compositions and methods of the present disclosure may be used to treat acne. As used herein, âacneâ means a disorder of the skin caused by inflammation of skin glands or hair follicles. The biophotonic compositions and methods of the disclosure can be used to treat acne at early pre-emergent stages or later stages where lesions from acne are visible. Mild, moderate and severe acne can be treated with embodiments of the biophotonic compositions and methods. Early pre-emergent stages of acne usually begin with an excessive secretion of sebum or dermal oil from the sebaceous glands located in the pilosebaceous apparatus. Sebum reaches the skin surface through the duct of the hair follicle. The presence of excessive amounts of sebum in the duct and on the skin tends to obstruct or stagnate the normal flow of sebum from the follicular duct, thus producing a thickening and solidification of the sebum to create a solid plug known as a comedone. In the normal sequence of developing acne, hyperkeratinazation of the follicular opening is stimulated, thus completing blocking of the duct. The usual results are papules, pustules, or cysts, often contaminated with bacteria, which cause secondary infections. Acne is characterized particularly by the presence of comedones, inflammatory papules, or cysts. The appearance of acne may range from slight skin irritation to pitting and even the development of disfiguring scars. Accordingly, the biophotonic compositions and methods of the present disclosure can be used to treat one or more of skin irritation, pitting, development of scars, comedones, inflammatory papules, cysts, hyperkeratinazation, and thickening and hardening of sebum associated with acne.</p>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0183">The composition may be soaked into or applied to a woven or non-woven material or a sponge and applied as a mask to body parts such as the face, body, arms, legs etc. A light source, such as LEDs or waveguides, may be provided within or adjacent the mask or the composition to illuminate the composition. The waveguides can be optical fibres which can transmit light, not only from their ends, but also from their body. For example, made of polycarbonate or polymethylmethacrylate.</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0184">The biophotonic compositions and methods of the present disclosure may be used to treat various types of acne.

      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="2">(7) Skin Aging and Rejuvenation</heading>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0185">The dermis is the second layer of skin, containing the structural elements of the skin, the connective tissue. There are various types of connective tissue with different functions. Elastin fibers give the skin its elasticity, and collagen gives the skin its strength.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0186">The junction between the dermis and the epidermis is an important structure. The dermal-epidermal junction interlocks forming finger-like epidermal ridges. The cells of the epidermis receive their nutrients from the blood vessels in the dermis. The epidermal ridges increase the surface area of the epidermis that is exposed to these blood vessels and the needed nutrients.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0187">The aging of skin comes with significant physiological changes to the skin. The generation of new skin cells slows down, and the epidermal ridges of the dermal-epidermal junction flatten out. While the number of elastin fibers increases, their structure and coherence decrease. Also the amount of collagen and the thickness of the dermis decrease with the ageing of the skin.</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0188">Collagen is a major component of the skin's extracellular matrix, providing a structural framework. During the aging process, the decrease of collagen synthesis and insolubilization of collagen fibers contribute to a thinning of the dermis and loss of the skin's biomechanical properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0189">The physiological changes to the skin result in noticeable aging symptoms often referred to as chronological-, intrinsic- and photo-ageing. The skin becomes drier, roughness and scaling increase, the appearance becomes duller, and most obviously fine lines and wrinkles appear. Other symptoms or signs of skin aging include, but are not limited to, thinning and transparent skin, loss of underlying fat (leading to hollowed cheeks and eye sockets as well as noticeable loss of firmness on the hands and neck), bone loss (such that bones shrink away from the skin due to bone loss, which causes sagging skin), dry skin (which might itch), inability to sweat sufficiently to cool the skin, unwanted facial hair, freckles, age spots, spider veins, rough and leathery skin, fine wrinkles that disappear when stretched, loose skin, a blotchy complexion.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0190">The dermal-epidermal junction is a basement membrane that separates the keratinocytes in the epidermis from the extracellular matrix, which lies below in the dermis. This membrane consists of two layers: the basal lamina in contact with the keratinocytes, and the underlying reticular lamina in contact with the extracellular matrix. The basal lamina is rich in collagen type IV and laminin, molecules that play a role in providing a structural network and bioadhesive properties for cell attachment.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0191">Laminin is a glycoprotein that only exists in basement membranes. It is composed of three polypeptide chains (alpha, beta and gamma) arranged in the shape of an asymmetric cross and held together by disulfide bonds. The three chains exist as different subtypes which result in twelve different isoforms for laminin, including Laminin-1 and Laminin-5.</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0192">The dermis is anchored to hemidesmosomes, specific junction points located on the keratinocytes, which consist of Î±-integrins and other proteins, at the basal membrane keratinocytes by type VII collagen fibrils. Laminins, and particularly Laminin-5, constitute the real anchor point between hemidesmosomal transmembrane proteins in basal keratinocytes and type VII collagen.</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0193">Laminin-5 synthesis and type VII collagen expression have been proven to decrease in aged skin. This causes a loss of contact between dermis and epidermis, and results in the skin losing elasticity and becoming saggy.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0194">Recently another type of wrinkles generally referred to as expression wrinkles, got general recognition. These wrinkles require loss of resilience, particularly in the dermis, because of which the skin is no longer able to resume its original state when facial muscles which produce facial expressions exert stress on the skin, resulting in expression wrinkles.</p>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0195">The compositions and methods of the present disclosure promote skin rejuvenation. In certain embodiments, the compositions and methods of the present disclosure promote collagen synthesis. In certain other embodiments, the compositions and methods of the present disclosure may reduce, diminish, retard or even reverse one or more signs of skin aging including, but not limited to, appearance of fine lines or wrinkles, thin and transparent skin, loss of underlying fat (leading to hollowed cheeks and eye sockets as well as noticeable loss of firmness on the hands and neck), bone loss (such that bones shrink away from the skin due to bone loss, which causes sagging skin), dry skin (which might itch), inability to sweat sufficiently to cool the skin, unwanted facial hair, freckles, age spots, spider veins, rough and leathery skin, fine wrinkles that disappear when stretched, loose skin, or a blotchy complexion. In certain embodiments, the compositions and methods of the present disclosure may induce a reduction in pore size, enhance sculpturing of skin subsections, and/or enhance skin translucence.</p>

      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0210">The photodynamic properties of (i) Fluorescein sodium salt at about 0.09 mg/mL, (ii) Eosin Y at about 0.305 mg/mL, and (iii) a mixture of Fluorescein sodium salt at about 0.09 mg/mL and Eosin Y at about 0.305 mg/mL, all in a gel (comprising about 12% carbamide peroxide), were evaluated. A flexstation 384 II spectrophotometer was used to measure emitted fluorescence with the following parameters: mode fluorescence, excitation 460 nm, emission spectra 465-750 nm. The absorbance was read using a synergy HT microplate reader: mode absorbance; spectra between 300-650 nm.</p>
      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0211">The absorption and emission spectra are shown in <figref>FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> which indicate an energy transfer between the chromophores in the combination. In particular a broader absorption and emission spectra was achieved with the Eosin Y and chromophore combination, compared with the individual chromophores. This means that the multiple chromophore composition can be activated with a broader bandwidth of light, and that the multiple chromophore light can emit a broader bandwidth of light after illumination. In other words, emission from the multi-chromophore composition occurred in a broader range of wavelengths compared to the individual chromophores. In this example, the composition emitted light in the green, yellow and orange wavelengths of the visible spectra. Photobleaching of Eosin Y was observed during illumination. Furthermore, results (not shown) indicate that the presence of peroxide in the gel does not affect the absorbance and emission spectra. Peroxide is optional in compositions and methods of the present disclosure.</p>

The composition emitted light in the green, yellow and orange wavelengths of the visible spectra. The difference in the absorption and emission spectra between Examples 1 and 2 may be explained by the optical difference in the media (gel in Example 1 and aqueous solution in this example) as well as possibly the effect of doubling the fluorescein concentration. It can be seen that adding Fluorescein to Eosin Y, broadens the bandwidth of the absorption and emission peaks of Eosin Y. This confers on the multiple chromophore combination, the ability to absorb a broader range of wavelengths for photoactivation and to emit a wider range of wavelengths which may confer different therapeutic effects at the same time. Photobleaching of Eosin Y was observed during illumination.</p>

      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0224">The synergy between two chromophores according to various embodiments of the present disclosure was investigated by preparing the following:</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0000">1âEosin Y (0.035%)+Rose Bengal (0.085%) in a 12% carbamide gel. <br /> 2âRose Bengal (0.085%) in a 12% carbamide gel. </p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0225">Rose Bengal is known to have a high quantum yield in terms of singlet oxygen production in the presence of oxygen-releasing agents when photoactivated by green light (a singlet oxygen quantum yield of approximately 75% in water [Murasecco-Suardi et al, <i>Helvetica Chimica Acta</i>, Vol. 70, pp. 1760-73, 1987]). Eosin Y is known to have a high quantum yield in terms of emitted fluorescent light when photoactivated and can be at least partially activated by blue light when in a gel. Photoactivated Eosin Y has a much lower quantum yield in terms of singlet oxygen production in the presence of oxygen-releasing agents (a singlet oxygen quantum yield when fully activated of approximately 4% [Gandin et al, <i>Photochemistry and Photobiology</i>, Vol. 37, pp. 271-8, 1983]).</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0226">When Eosin Y and Rose Bengal are combined, it appears that both chromophores are activated by the same blue light as evidenced by <figref>FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0227">
        <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, left panel, shows a photograph of the composition when viewed under a light microscope (Ã250) before exposure to an activating blue light. Very few bubbles were seen in both compositions. Following illumination with blue light a dramatic increase in bubbles was seen with the composition comprising a combination of Eosin Y and Rose Bengal, but not with the composition comprising Rose Bengal alone or Eosin Y alone (not shown). This suggests that there is a transfer of energy from Eosin Y to Rose Bengal leading to the formation oxygen species. Eosin Y alone in a carbamide gel presented similar properties to Rose Bengal. A similar effect was observed with Fluorescein and Rose Bengal.</p>

      <heading id="h-00032-en" level="1">Variation of the Chromophore Concentration Ratios</heading>
      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0228">The effect of varying the concentrations of the individual chromophores in multiple chromophore compositions, according to embodiments of the present disclosure, were investigated. The fluorescence emission over time of compositions comprising (i) FluoresceinâEosin Y, and (ii) Eosin YâRose Bengal, are presented in <figref>FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref> respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0229">As can be seen in <figref>FIG. 13A</figref>, the emission properties of the following were investigated: (i) 109 Î¼g/g of Eosin Y+10 Î¼g/g of fluorescein, (ii) 109 Î¼g/g of Eosin Y+100 Î¼g/g of fluorescein, (iii) 109 Î¼g/g of Eosin Y, (iv) 10 Î¼g/g of fluorescein, (v) 100 Î¼g/g of fluorescein, all in a carbamide peroxide gel. An SP-100 spectroradiometer was used to measure the power density spectra (mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>versus wavelength) of a photonic signal detected from the various compositions when illuminated with blue light (wavelength of about 440 to 480 nm at a power density of less than 150 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>for about 5 minutes). Fluorescence is measured as light within the 519-700 nm range.</p>
      <p id="p-00233-en" num="0230">As can be seen, the emitted fluorescence of all concentrations decay over time. This decay is often accompanied by a photobleaching of one or more of the chromophores in the composition. A higher concentration of fluorescein in a multiple chromophore composition provides a higher initial emitted fluorescence which also lasts longer, i.e. has a longer lifetime. For the Eosin Y (109 Î¼g/g) and Fluorescein (100 Î¼g/g) composition, the initial emitted fluorescence is slightly lower than that of a composition comprising 100 Î¼g/g fluorescein alone. This may be attributed to use of energy to form oxygen species (as described in Example 6 above). Therefore, the relative concentrations of the chromophores within a multiple chromophore composition can be varied to tailor the resultant fluorescence and oxygen species properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00234-en" num="0231">In <figref>FIG. 13B</figref>, the following compositions were evaluated (i) 109 Î¼g/g of Eosin Y+1 Î¼g/g of rose bengal (ratio of about 10:1), (ii) 109 Î¼g/g of Eosin Y+100 Î¼g/g of rose bengal (ratio of about 1:1), (iii) 109 Î¼g/g of Eosin Y, (iv) 1 Î¼g/g of rose bengal, (v) 100 Î¼g/g of rose bengal, all in a carbamide peroxide gel. The same decay trend observed in <figref>FIG. 13A</figref> was also observed for eosin Y alone, eosin Y-1 Î¼g/g rose bengal, as well as eosin Y-10 Î¼g/g rose Bengal (not shown). The very low fluorescence levels for both concentrations of rose bengal alone when activated by blue light can also be observed. Surprisingly, for the composition of 109 Î¼g/g of Eosin Y+100 Î¼g/g of rose bengal a sustained fluorescence was observed, albeit at a lower level than that of Eosin Y alone, and Eosin Y+1 Î¼g/g of rose bengal. In this composition, no photobleaching of Eosin Y was observed. Without wishing to be limited by theory, it is believed that Eosin Y is not photobleaching as at this ratio of Eosin Y/rose Bengal, Eosin Y is able to transfer all of its absorbed energy to rose bengal which then emits the energy and thus prevents the photodegradation of the eosin Y molecules. The peak emission wavelength of the 109 Î¼g/g Eosin Y+100 Î¼g/g rose bengal composition is closer to that of rose bengal's peak emission wavelength than that of eosin y.</p>
      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0232">A similar sustained fluorescence effect was observed for a composition comprising fluorescein, eosin Y and rose bengal at relative concentration ratios of about 1:10:10 (not shown).</p>

      <p id="p-00241-en" num="0238">A human skin model was developed to assess the angiogenic potential of compositions of the present disclosure. Briefly, a composition comprising Eosin Y and Erythrosine was placed on top of a human skin model containing fibroblasts and keratinocytes. The skin model and the composition were separated by a nylon mesh of 20 micron pore size. The composition was then irradiated with blue light (âactivating lightâ) for 5 minutes at a distance of 5 cm from the light source. The activating light consisted of light emitted from an LED lamp having an average peak wavelength of about 400-470 nm, and a power intensity measured at 10 cm of 7.7 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 11.5 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. Upon illumination with the activating light, the composition emitted fluorescent light. Since the composition was in limited contact with the cells, the fibroblasts and keratinocytes were exposed mainly to the activating light and the fluorescent light emitted from the composition. Conditioned media from the treated human 3D skin model were then applied to human aortic endothelial cells previously plated in MatrigelÂ®. The formation of tubes by endothelial cells was observed and monitored by microscopy and image analysis after 24 hours. The conditioned media from 3D skin models treated with light illumination induced endothelial tube formation in vitro, suggesting an indirect effect of the light treatment (blue light and fluorescence) on angiogenesis via the production of factors by fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Plain media and conditioned media from untreated skin samples were used as a control, and did not induce endothelial tube formation.</p>

As can be seen from <figref>FIG. 16</figref>, the emitted fluorescence light had a wavelength of about 520-620 nm with a peak at around 560 nm.

      <heading id="h-00040-en" level="1">Protein Secretion and Gene Expression Profiles</heading>
      <p id="p-00243-en" num="0240">Wounded and unwounded 3D human skin models (EpiDermFT, MatTek Corporation) were used to assess the potential of a composition of the present disclosure to trigger distinct protein secretion and gene expression profiles. Briefly, a composition comprising Eosin and Erythrosine were placed on top of wounded and unwounded 3D human skin models cultured under different conditions (with growth factors (1Ã), 50% growth factors (0.5Ã) and no growth factors (0Ã)). The different conditions mimicked non-compromised healing, semi-starvation conditions and starvations conditions, respectively. The skin models and the composition were separated by a nylon mesh of 20 micron pore size. Each skin model-composition combination was then irradiated with blue light (âactivating lightâ) for 5 minutes at a distance of 5 cm from the light source. The activating light consisted of light emitted from an LED lamp having an average peak wavelength of about 440-470 nm, a power density of 60-150 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>at 5 cm, and a total energy density after 5 minutes of about 18-39 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. The controls consisted of 3D skin models not illuminated with light.</p>
      <p id="p-00244-en" num="0241">Gene expression and protein secretion profiles were measured 24 hours post-light exposure. Cytokine secretion was analyzed by antibody arrays (RayBio Human Cytokine antibody array), gene expression was analyzed by PCR array (PAHS-013A, SABioscience) and cytotoxicity was determined by GAPDH and LDH release. Results (Tables 1 and 2) showed that the light treatment is capable of increasing the level of protein secreted and gene expression involved in the early inflammatory phase of wound healing in wounded skin inserts and in non-starvation conditions. In starvation conditions mimicking chronic wounds, there was no increase in the level of inflammatory protein secreted when compared to the control. Interestingly, the effect of the light treatment on unwounded skin models has a much lower impact at the cellular level than on wounded skin insert, which suggests an effect at the cellular effect level of the light treatment. It seems to accelerate the inflammatory phase of the wound healing process. Due to the lack of other cell types such as macrophages in the 3D skin model, the anti-inflammatory feed-back is absent and may explain the delay in wound closure. Cytotoxicity was not observed in the light treatments. The eosin y and erythrosine b composition had the same emission properties as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 16</figref>. As stated above, it can be reasonably inferred that other chromophore combinations exhibiting a comparable emission spectra would also induce secretion of proteins or gene expression as seen in this Example.</p>

      <p id="p-00247-en" num="0242">A composition according to an embodiment of the present invention, comprising 0.01% Eosin Y and 0.01% Fluorescein in a carrier matrix (1.8% carbopol gel) was evaluated for its potential to induce collagen formation. Dermal human fibroblasts were plated in glass-bottomed dishes with wells (MatTekÂ®). There were approximately 4000 cells per well. After 48 hours, the glass-bottomed dishes were inverted and the cells were treated through the glass bottom with (i) a no light (control), (ii) sunlight exposure for about 13 minutes at noon (control), (iii) the composition applied to the glass well bottom on the other side of the cells (no light exposure), (iv) the composition applied to the glass well bottom on the other side of the cells (sun light exposure for about 13 minutes at noon), and (v) the composition applied to the glass well bottom on the other side of the cells (blue light exposure for about 5 minutes). In the case of (iii), (iv) and (v), there was no direct contact between the cells and the composition. In the case of (iv) and (v), the cells were exposed to emitted light from and through the Eosin Y and Fluorescein composition when exposed to sunlight and blue light respectively. An at least partial photobleaching was observed in (iv) and (v). After the treatment, the cells were washed and incubated in regular medium for 48 hours. A collagen assay was then performed on the supernatant using the Picro-Sirius red method. This involved adding Sirius red dye solution in picric acid to the supernatant, incubating with gentle agitation for 30 minutes followed by centrifugation to form a pellet. The pellet was washed first with 0.1N HCl and then 0.5 N NaOH to remove free dye. After centrifugation, the suspension was read at 540 nm for collagen type I. The results are shown in Table 1.</p>

      <p id="p-00249-en" num="0243">There was a statistical difference between the collagen levels induced by the Eosin Y and Fluorescein composition exposed to sunlight and blue light compared to the no light and sunlight alone controls.</p>
      <p id="p-00250-en" num="0244">Collagen generation is indicative of a potential for tissue repair including stabilization of granulation tissue and decreasing of wound size. It is also linked to reduction of fine lines, a decrease in pore size, improvement of texture and improvement of tensile strength of intact skin. The emission spectra of the Eosin Y and Fluorescein composition of this example had a single peak emission with a wavelength that ranged from about 480-620 nm. Following illumination with sunlight, the power density of the peak was reduced indicating an at least partial photobleaching in 13 minutes, which was also observed by a change in colour of the composition. The rate of fluorescence emission/photobleaching was slower when illuminated by sunlight (white light) compared to Eosin Y and Fluorescein compositions (e.g. compositions of Examples 5 and 6) when activated by blue light.</p>

      <heading id="h-00044-en" level="1">Selecting the Concentration of Chromophore in the Biophotonic Composition</heading>
      <p id="p-00251-en" num="0245">The fluorescence spectra of compositions with different concentrations of chromophores were investigated using a spectroradiometer and an activating blue light (as in Example 9). Exemplary fluorescence spectra of Eosin Y and Fluorescein are presented in <figref>FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>. It was found that emitted fluorescence from the chromophore increases rapidly with increasing concentration but slows down to a plateau with further concentration increase. Activating light passing through the composition decreases with increasing chromophore composition as more is absorbed by the chromophores. Therefore, the concentration of chromophores in compositions of the present disclosure can be selected according to a required ratio and level of activating light and fluorescence treating the tissue based on this example. In some embodiments, it will be after the zone of rapid increase, i.e. between 0.5 and 1 mg/mL for Eosin Y (<figref>FIG. 17A</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00252-en" num="0246">Therefore, concentration can be selected according to required activating light and fluorescence. In some embodiments, it will be after zone of rapid increase, i.e. between 0.5 and 1 mg/mL for Eosin Y (<figref>FIG. 17A</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00253-en" num="0247">Compositions with rose bengal behave slightly differently and become more opaque with increasing concentration which may be due to bubble formation.</p>
      <p id="p-00254-en" num="0248">Similarly, the relationship between the power density of light received by the tissues with illuminating time was investigated. It was found that the power density of the activating light was low initially and increased with time. This correlates with the light absorbing chromophores photobleaching and more of the activating light passing through the composition to reach tissues. In parallel, the fluorescent light emitted by the composition decreased with time as one or more of the chromophores photobleached. Overall, the total power density of the light treating the tissues increased gradually over illumination time.</p>
