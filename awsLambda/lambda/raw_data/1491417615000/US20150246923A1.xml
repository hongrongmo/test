      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present disclosure provides BET bromodomain inhibitors and therapeutic methods of treating conditions and diseases wherein inhibition of one or more BET bromodomains provides a benefit.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The genomes of eukaryotic organisms are highly organized within the nucleus of the cell. The long strands of duplex DNA are wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins (usually comprising two copies of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) to form a nucleosome, which then is further compressed to form a highly condensed chromatin structure. A range of different condensation states are possible, and the tightness of this structure varies during the cell cycle. The chromatin structure plays a critical role in regulating gene transcription, which cannot occur efficiently from highly condensed chromatin. The chromatin structure is controlled by a series of post translational modifications to histone proteins, notably histones H3 and H4. These modifications include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitinylation, and SUMOylation.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Histone acetylation usually is associated with the activation of gene transcription, as the modification loosens the interaction of the DNA and the histone octamer by changing the electrostatics. In addition to this physical change, specific proteins bind to acetylated lysine residues within histones to read the epigenetic code. Bromodomains are small (about 110 amino acids) distinct domains within proteins that bind to acetylated lysine resides commonly, but not exclusively, in the context of histones. There is a family of about 50 proteins known to contain bromodomains, which have a range of functions within the cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The BET family of bromodomain-containing proteins (âBET bromodomainsâ) includes four proteins, i.e., BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRD-t, which contain tandem bromodomains capable of binding to two acetylated lysine residues in close proximity, thereby increasing the specificity of the interaction. BRD2 and BRD3 associate with histones along actively transcribed genes and may be involved in facilitating transcriptional elongation, while BRD4 may be involved in the recruitment of the pTEF-Î² complex to inducible genes, resulting in phosphorylation of RNA polymerase and increased transcriptional output. BRD4 or BRD3 also may fuse with NUT (nuclear protein in testis) forming novel fusion oncogenes, BRD4-NUT or BRD3-NUT, in a highly malignant form of epithelial neoplasia. Data suggests that BRD-NUT fusion proteins contribute to carcinogenesis. BRD-t is uniquely expressed in the testes and ovary. All family members have been reported to have some function in controlling or executing aspects of the cell cycle, and have been shown to remain in complex with chromosomes during cell division, which suggests a role in the maintenance of epigenetic memory. In addition, some viruses make use of these proteins to tether their genomes to the host cell chromatin as part of the process of viral replication.</p>

      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Men who develop metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) invariably succumb to the disease. The development and progression to CRPC following androgen ablation therapy is predominantly driven by unregulated androgen receptor (AR) signaling (Taylor, B. S. et al., <i>Cancer Cell </i>18:11-22 (2010); Chen, C. D. et al., <i>Nat Med </i>10:33-39 (2004); Visakorpi, T. et al., <i>Nat Genet </i>9:401-406 (1995)). Despite the success of recently approved therapies targeting AR signaling such as abiraterone (Stein, M. N., Goodin, S. and Dipaola, R. S., <i>Clin Cancer Res </i>18:1848-1854 (2012); Reid, A. H. et al. <i>J Clin Oncol </i>28: 1489-1495 (2010); de Bono, J. S. et al., <i>N Engl J Med </i>364: 1995-2005 (2011)) and second generation anti-androgens MDV3100 (enzalutamide) (Mukherji, D. et al. <i>Expert Opin Investig Drugs </i>21:227-233 (2012); Scher, H. I. et al., <i>N Engl J Med </i>367:1187-1197 (2012)), durable responses are limited, presumably due to acquired resistance. Recently JQ1 and I-BET, two selective small molecule inhibitors that target the amino-terminal bromodomains of BRD4, have been shown to exhibit antiproliferative effects in a range of malignancies (Lockwood, W. W. et al., <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>109:19 408-19413 (2012); Dawson, M. A. et al., <i>Nature </i>478: 529-533 (2011); Delmore, J. E. et al. <i>Cell </i>146: 904-917 (2011); Puissant, A. et al. <i>Cancer Discov </i>3:308-323 (2013)). BRD4 physically interacts with the N-terminal domain of AR and can be disrupted by JQ1 (Delmore, J. E. et al. <i>Cell </i>146: 904-917 (2011); Puissant, A. et al. <i>Cancer Discov </i>3:308-323 (2013); Filippakopoulos, P. et al. <i>Nature </i>468:1067-1073 (2010)).</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The identification and therapeutic targeting of co-activators or mediators of AR transcriptional signaling should be considered as alternate strategies to treat CRPC (Attard, G. et al., <i>Clin Cancer Res </i>17:1649-1657 (2011)). BRD4 is a conserved member of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of chromatin readers that include BRD2/3 and BRDT. BRD4 plays a critical role in transcription by RNA PolII, by facilitating recruitment of the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb (Jang, M. K. et al., <i>Mol Cell </i>19:523-534 (2005); Yang, Z. et al., <i>Mol Cell </i>19: 535-545 (2005). Similar to other BET-family proteins, BRD4 contains two conserved bromodomains, BD1 and BD2. Competitive binding of JQ1 or I-BET to the bromodomain pocket results in the displacement BRD4 from active chromatin and subsequent removal of RNA PolII from target genes (Dawson, M. A. et al., <i>Nature </i>478: 529-533 (2011); Delmore, J. E. et al., <i>Cell </i>146: 904-917 (2011); Puissant, A. et al., <i>Cancer Discov </i>3:308-323 (2013); Filippakopoulos, P. et al., <i>Nature </i>468:1067-1073 (2010); Loven, J. et al., 153:320-334 (2013)) Although most cancer cells express BET-family proteins, it is not clear why only a subset of cell lines from diverse cancers respond to BET-inhibitors (Lockwood, W. W. et al. <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>109:19408-19413 (2012); Mertz, J. A. et al., <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>108:16669-16674 (2011)). Recently, BRD4 was shown to interact with sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors in a gene-specific manner (Wu, S. Y. et al., <i>Mol Cell </i>49:843-857 (2013)). As the genetic and epigenetic landscape differs between tumor types, it is possible that distinct transcriptional regulators that associate with BRD4 might influence the action of BET-inhibitors.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Breast cancer accounts for more than 20% of all cancers in women worldwide. The expression of androgen receptor (AR) is widespread both in ER (estrogen receptor)-positive and ER-negative breast cancers. In ER positive breast cancer adjuvant therapy with ER antagonist tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (AIs)âwhich block conversion of androgen to estrogens, has shown to be effective in inhibiting disease progression. Moreover, direct AR antagonist Enzalutamide (MDV3100) has recently been proposed as a therapeutic modality for AR positive breast cancers.</p>

In particular, Compounds of the Disclosure are useful in methods of treating a disease or condition wherein inhibition of BET bromodomains provides a benefit, for example, cancers and proliferative diseases. Methods of the disclosure comprise administering a therapeutically effective amount of a Compound of the Disclosure to an individual in need thereof. The present methods also encompass administering a second therapeutic agent to the individual in addition to the Compound of the Disclosure. The second therapeutic agent is selected from drugs known as useful in treating the disease or condition afflicting the individual in need thereof, e.g., a chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation known as useful in treating a particular cancer.</p>
      <p id="p-00357-en" num="0291">Salts, hydrates, and solvates of the Compounds of the Disclosure can also be used in the methods disclosed herein. The present disclosure further includes all possible stereoisomers and geometric isomers of Compounds of the Disclosure to include both racemic compounds and optically active isomers. When a Compound of the Disclosure is desired as a single enantiomer, it can be obtained either by resolution of the final product or by stereospecific synthesis from either isomerically pure starting material or use of a chiral auxiliary reagent, for example, see Z. Ma et al., <i>Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, </i>8(6), pages 883-888 (1997). Resolution of the final product, an intermediate, or a starting material can be achieved by any suitable method known in the art. Additionally, in situations where tautomers of the Compounds of the Disclosure are possible, the present disclosure is intended to include all tautomeric forms of the compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00358-en" num="0292">The present disclosure encompasses the preparation and use of salts of Compounds of the Disclosure. As used herein, the pharmaceutical âpharmaceutically acceptable saltâ refers to salts or zwitterionic forms of Compounds of the Disclosure. Salts of Compounds of the Disclosure can be prepared during the final isolation and purification of the compounds or separately by reacting the compound with an acid having a suitable cation. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of Compounds of the Disclosure can be acid addition salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable acids. Examples of acids which can be employed to form pharmaceutically acceptable salts include inorganic acids such as nitric, boric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, and phosphoric, and organic acids such as oxalic, maleic, succinic, and citric. Nonlimiting examples of salts of compounds of the disclosure include, but are not limited to, the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulfate, bisulfate, 2-hydroxyethansulfonate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, digluconate, glycerolphsphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, formate, succinate, fumarate, maleate, ascorbate, isethionate, salicylate, methanesulfonate, mesitylenesulfonate, naphthylenesulfonate, nicotinate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylproprionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, trichloroacetate, trifluoroacetate, phosphate, glutamate, bicarbonate, paratoluenesulfonate, undecanoate, lactate, citrate, tartrate, gluconate, methanesulfonate, ethanedisulfonate, benzene sulfonate, and p-toluenesulfonate salts. In addition, available amino groups present in the compounds of the disclosure can be quaternized with methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides; dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates; decyl, lauryl, myristyl, and steryl chlorides, bromides, and iodides; and benzyl and phenethyl bromides. In light of the foregoing, any reference Compounds of the Disclosure appearing herein is intended to include compounds of Compounds of the Disclosure as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, or solvates thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00359-en" num="0293">The present disclosure encompasses the preparation and use of solvates of Compounds of the Disclosure. Solvates typically do not significantly alter the physiological activity or toxicity of the compounds, and as such may function as pharmacological equivalents. The term âsolvateâ as used herein is a combination, physical association and/or solvation of a compound of the present disclosure with a solvent molecule such as, e.g. a disolvate, monosolvate or hemisolvate, where the ratio of solvent molecule to compound of the present disclosure is about 2:1, about 1:1 or about 1:2, respectively. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances, the solvate can be isolated, such as when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated into the crystal lattice of a crystalline solid. Thus, âsolvateâ encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. Compounds of the Disclosure can be present as solvated forms with a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as water, methanol, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the disclosure includes both solvated and unsolvated forms of Compounds of the Disclosure. One type of solvate is a hydrate. A âhydrateâ relates to a particular subgroup of solvates where the solvent molecule is water. Solvates typically can function as pharmacological equivalents. Preparation of solvates is known in the art. See, for example, M. Caira et al, <i>J. Pharmaceut. Sci., </i>93(3):601-611 (2004), which describes the preparation of solvates of fluconazole with ethyl acetate and with water. Similar preparation of solvates, hemisolvates, hydrates, and the like are described by E. C. van Tonder et al., <i>AAPS Pharm. Sci. Tech., </i>5(1):Article 12 (2004), and A. L. Bingham et al., <i>Chem. Commun. </i>603-604 (2001). A typical, non-limiting, process of preparing a solvate would involve dissolving a Compound of the Disclosure in a desired solvent (organic, water, or a mixture thereof) at temperatures above 20Â° C. to about 25Â° C., then cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals, and isolating the crystals by known methods, e.g., filtration. Analytical techniques such as infrared spectroscopy can be used to confirm the presence of the solvent in a crystal of the solvate.</p>
      <p id="p-00360-en" num="0294">The present disclosure provides Compounds of the Disclosure as BET bromodomain inhibitors for the treatment of a variety of diseases and conditions wherein inhibition of BET bromodomains has a beneficial effect. Compounds of the Disclosure typically have a binding affinity (IC<sub>50</sub>) to BET bromodomains of less than 100 Î¼M, e.g., less than 50 Î¼M, less than 25 Î¼M, and less than 5 Î¼M, less than about 1 Î¼M, less than about 0.5 Î¼M, or less than about 0.1 Î¼M. In one embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a method of treating an individual suffering from a disease or condition wherein inhibition of the BET bromodomains provides a benefit comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a Compound of the Disclosure to an individual in need thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00361-en" num="0295">Since Compounds of the Disclosure are inhibitors of one or more BET bromodomains, a number of diseases and conditions mediated by BET bromodomain proteins can be treated by employing these compounds. The present disclosure is thus directed generally to a method for treating a condition or disorder responsive to inhibition of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, BRD-t, or an isoform or mutant thereof, in an animal, e.g., a human, suffering from, or at risk of suffering from, the condition or disorder, the method comprising administering to the animal an effective amount of one or more Compounds of the Disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00362-en" num="0296">The present disclosure is further directed to a method of inhibiting BET bromodomains in an animal in need thereof, said method comprising administering to the animal an effective amount of at least one Compound of the Disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00363-en" num="0297">The methods of the present disclosure can be accomplished by administering a Compound of the Disclosure as the neat compound or as a pharmaceutical composition. Administration of a pharmaceutical composition, or neat compound of a Compound of the Disclosure, can be performed during or after the onset of the disease or condition of interest. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions are sterile, and contain no toxic, carcinogenic, or mutagenic compounds that would cause an adverse reaction when administered. Further provided are kits comprising a Compound of the Disclosure and, optionally, a second therapeutic agent useful in the treatment of diseases and conditions wherein inhibition of BET bromodomains provides a benefit, packaged separately or together, and an insert having instructions for using these active agents.</p>
      <p id="p-00364-en" num="0298">In one embodiment, a Compound of the Disclosure is administered in conjunction with a second therapeutic agent useful in the treatment of a disease or condition wherein inhibition of BET bromodomains provides a benefit.

      <p id="p-01190-en" num="1109">Fluorescence Polarization (FP) competitive binding studies were carried out using a FAM labeled fluorescent probe (ZBA248 or BRD-1F) to determine binding affinities of representative Compounds of the Disclosure for recombinant BRD4 BD1 and BRD4 BD2 proteins. For example, equilibrium dissociation constants (K<sub>d</sub>) values of ZBA248 to these six proteins were determined from protein saturation experiments by monitoring the total fluorescence polarization of mixtures composed with the fluorescent probe at a fixed concentration and proteins with increasing concentrations up to full saturation. Serial dilutions of testing protein were mixed with ZBA248 to a final volume of 200 Î¼l in the assay buffer. In order to achieve large dynamic rages, particularly for BD1 bromodomains, 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH=6.5, 0.01% Triton X-100 (Sigma, 282103) being added right before assays) was used as the assay buffer. Final ZBA248 concentration was 1.5 nM for all proteins. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with gentle shaking to assure equilibrium. FP values in millipolarization units (mP) were measured using the Infinite M-1000 plate reader (Tecan U.S., Research Triangle Park, NC) in Microfluor 1 96-well, black, round-bottom plates (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Mass.) at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. K<sub>d </sub>values of ZBA248 were calculated by fitting the sigmoidal dose-dependent FP increases as a function of protein concentrations using Graphpad Prism 6.0 software (Graphpad Software, San Diego, Calif.).</p>
      <p id="p-01191-en" num="1110">The IC<sub>50 </sub>and K<sub>i </sub>values of representative Compounds of the Disclosure were determined in a competitive binding experiment as described above. Mixtures of 10 Î¼l of the tested compounds in assay buffer with 40% Ethylene Glycol and 190 Î¼l of preincubated protein/probe complex solution in the assay buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.01% Triton X-100) were added into assay plates which were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with gentle shaking. Final concentrations of proteins were 10 and 6 nM in assays for BD1 and BD2 of BRD4, respectively. Final probe concentration is 1.5 nM in all assays. Negative controls containing protein/probe complex only (equivalent to 0% inhibition), and positive controls containing only free probes (equivalent to 100% inhibition), were included in each assay plate. FP values were measured as described above. IC<sub>50 </sub>values were determined by nonlinear regression fitting of the competition curves. Instead of being calculated from IC<sub>50 </sub>values as described before, K<sub>i </sub>values of competitive inhibitors were obtained directly by nonlinear regression fitting as well, based upon the K<sub>d </sub>values of the probe to different proteins, and concentrations of the proteins and probes in the competitive assays (Wang, <i>FEBS Lett. </i>360; 111 (1995); Zhang et al., <i>Analytical Biochemistry, </i>331; 138 (2004)).</p>

      <p id="p-01195-en" num="1113">Cell growth inhibitory activity of representative Compounds of the Disclosure was determined using CellTiter-GloÂ® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. For leukemia cell lines MV-4-11 (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) and MOLM-13 (DSMZ, Germany), cells were seeded in 96-well white opaque cell culture plates at a density of 10,000 cells/well with serially diluted compounds and incubated at 37Â° C. in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 for 4 days. Cell viability was determined using the CellTiter-GloÂ® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, Wis.) according to the manufacture's instruction. Briefly, a volume of CellTiter-GloÂ® Reagent equal to the volume of cell culture medium was added to each well, and then the plates were incubated at room temperature for 10-20 minutes. The luminescent signal was measured using a Tecan Infinite M1000 multimode microplate reader (Tecan, Morrisville, N.C.). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated using the GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, Calif.).</p>

All the breast cancer cell lines were obtained from the ATCC. Cell viability was determined using the WST-8 (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt) based Cell Counting-8 Kit (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Rockville, Md.) according to the manufacture's instruction. Briefly, WST-8 was added to each well at a final concentration of 10% (v/v), and then the plates were incubated at 37Â° C. for 1-2 hours for color development. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a SPECTRAmax PLUS plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). The IC<sub>50 </sub>was calculated using the GraphPad Prism 5 software.</p>
      <p id="p-01197-en" num="1115">For prostate cancer cell lines, VCaP prostate cancer cells were grown in DMEM with Glutamax (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2 cell culture incubator. All cell lines were tested and found to be free of mycoplasma contamination. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 2,000-10,000 cells per well (optimum density for growth) in a total volume of 100 ml media containing 10% FBS. Serially diluted compounds in 100 ml media were added to the cells 12 h later. After 96 h incubation, cell viability was assessed by Cell-Titer GLO (Promega). The values were normalized and IC<sub>50 </sub>was calculated using GraphPad Prism software.</p>

      <p id="p-01203-en" num="1118">A panel of 5 prostate cancer and 1 benign prostate cell line was treated with the JQ1. Three of the AR-signaling positive cells were found to be sensitive to JQ1, though all six cell lines express high levels of its target proteins (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>). Next, knockdown of BRD2/3/4 (data not shown) showed significant inhibition of cell proliferation/invasion, phenocopying JQ1-treatment (data not shown). Further, JQ1-treatment induced G<sub>0</sub>-G<sub>1 </sub>arrest, apoptosis and associated transcriptional downregulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL-xl protein in AR-positive cells (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>) (Filippakopoulos, P. et al., <i>Nature </i>468:1067-1073 (2010); Mertz, J. A. et al., <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>108:16669-16674 (2011)). Similar to BCL2 down-regulation by the BET-inhibitor, I-BET151, in leukemia (Dawson, M. A. et al., <i>Nature </i>478:529-533 (2011)); reduction in BCL-xl by JQ1 could in part be explained by the observation of loss of BRD2/3/4 recruitment to its promoter region (data not shown). Even at 100 nM, long term colony-formation of AR-positive cells were severely inhibited with JQ1 (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>) with no apparent effect on JQ1 target proteins (data not shown). As AR-positive cells were preferentially sensitive to JQ1, it was examined whether JQ1 has an effect on AR-target genes. VCaP cells, which harbor the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and AR amplification (Tomlins, S. A. et al., <i>Science </i>310:644-648 (2005)), displayed a dose-dependent decrease in PSA and ERGâboth at the mRNA and protein level (<figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>). Similar effects of JQ1-treatment were seen in LNCaP and 22RV1 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, bortezomib did not reverse the JQ1-mediated PSA and ERG protein loss, indicating that these genes are regulated at the transcriptional level (data not shown). Microarray analysis was performed to examine changes in global gene expression upon JQ1-treatment. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using the AR-gene signature (Table 6), revealed these genes were significantly repressed in AR-positive cells (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>) suggesting BET-protein regulation of AR-mediated transcription. Additionally, a loss of the MYC associated gene signature was observed in AR-positive cell lines upon JQ1-treatment (Table 7). MYC is a known transcriptional target of BET-inhibition in hematological cancers (Delmore, J. E. et al., <i>Cell </i>146:904-917 (2011); Mertz, J. A. et al., <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA/</i>08:16669-16674 (2011)). MYC levels were attenuated by JQ1 in cells which are AR-positive and sensitive to JQ1 inhibition, but not in AR-negative cells (data not shown). Thus, high expression of MYC per se (data not shown) does not confer sensitivity to JQ1 in prostate cancer cells. Time-course experiments with JQ1 demonstrated loss of MYC (data not shown), and cyclohexamide had no additional effect on MYC protein (data not shown), ruling out a post-translational mode of JQ1 action on MYC proteins. Phenotypically, knockdown of MYC did not affect cell invasion (data not shown), while JQ1-treatment inhibited invasion (data not shown). Additionally, exogenous expression of MYC did not result in a rescue of JQ1-mediated inhibition of cell growth (data not shown). Thus, while MYC levels may be repressed by JQ1 in AR-positive cells, and may have a role in proliferation, MYC does not appear to be the primary target for the anti-neoplastic effects of JQ1.</p>
      <p id="p-01204-en" num="1119">JQ1 block or AR target gene transcription (<figref>FIGS. 4-6</figref>) suggested that AR may interact with BRD4 which is known to engage sequence-specific DNA binding proteins (Wu, S. Y. et al., <i>Mol Cell </i>49:843-857 (2013)). Gel-filtration-chromatography were performed and it was found that AR and BRD4 predominantly eluted together in a high-molecular weight complex (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>). Moreover, RNA PolII which was reported as a target for phosphorylation by BRD4 (Devaiah, B. N. et al., <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>109:6927-6932 (2012)) also co-eluted in the same complex, suggestive of the existence of a large multi-protein complex consisting of AR, BRD4 and RNA PolII. Immunoprecipitation experiments further confirmed an endogenous association between AR and BRD4 (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>). Additionally, an interaction between AR and BRD2/3 (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>) was observed, implying a common region in BRD2/3/4 proteins responsible for AR interaction. In order to map the region mediating this interaction, the ability of different deletion variants of BRD4 to pull-down AR in 293T cells (<figref>FIG. 9</figref>) was tested. It was found that truncated version of BRD4 which comprised BD1-BD2 domains maintained the ability to pull-down AR even at high salt concentrations (<figref>FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>). To determine whether the BD1-BD2 domains directly interact with AR, quantitative assessment of the binding affinity using the Octet-RED system was carried out. Varying concentrations of BD1-BD2 protein were applied to biosensors with immobilized AR, and it was found that BRD4 interacts with AR in a concentration dependent fashion, with an estimated Kd of 70 nM, supporting a high affinity interaction (<figref>FIG. 12</figref>). This interaction was fine-mapped to create a series of Halo-AR and GST-BRD4 constructs for in vitro pull-down studies that demonstrated that the BD1, and to a lesser extent the BD2, of BRD4 bind directly to NTD-domain of AR, which was further mapped to a 38 amino acid region NTD1b of AR (<figref>FIGS. 13-15</figref>). Subsequently, the disruption of BD1-AR and BD1-NTD1b interactions by JQ1 (<figref>FIG. 16</figref>) was observed. Likewise, JQ1 treated VCaP displayed loss of the endogenous BRD4-AR interaction (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that BET protein inhibition leads to disruption of the AR-BRD4 interaction and may account for the preferential activity of JQ1 in AR-positive prostate cancer cells.</p>
      <p id="p-01205-en" num="1120">Ubiquitously expressed BRD2/3/4 proteins are suggested to have overlapping functions (Dawson, M. A. et al., <i>Nature </i>478:529-533 (2011); Filippakopoulos, P. et al., <i>Nature </i>468:1067-1073 (2010); Belkina, A. C. and Denis, G. V., <i>Nat Rev Cancer </i>12:465-477 (2012) and consistent with this, AR interaction with BRD2/3/4 was observed. BET-inhibitors such as JQ1 and I-BET762 are known for their high affinity binding toward BD1/BD2 domain of BRD2/3/4 proteins (Dawson, M. A. et al., <i>Nature </i>478:529-533 (2011); Delmore, J. E. et al., <i>Cell </i>146:904-917 (2011); Filippakopoulos, P. et al., <i>Nature </i>468:1067-1073 (2010)). This suggests that BET-inhibitors might affect genome-wide recruitment of all the three BET-proteins. Towards this end, ChIP-seq with antibodies against BRD2/3/4 in VCaP cells treated with JQ1 or I-BET762 (Table 8) was performed. A high genome-wide overlap between BRD2/3/4 (62-86% peak overlap) was observed (data not shown). JQ1 or I-BET762 treatment led to a reduction in the recruitment of all three proteins to the chromatin (data not shown). Moreover, this reduced BRD2/3/4 recruitment was equally distributed for regions with or without AR (data not shown).</p>
      <p id="p-01206-en" num="1121">Binding of androgen (DHT) to AR leads to its activation/translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it binds to regions of DNA comprising AREs and results in subsequent recruitment of proteins involved in transcriptional activation or suppression in a gene-specific manner. BRD4 interacts with acetylated histones as well as DNA binding transcription factors, leading to context-dependent transcriptional activation or inhibition of target genes (Jang, M. K. et al., <i>Mol Cell </i>19:523-534 (2005); Wu, S. Y. et al., <i>Mol Cell </i>49:843-857 (2013); Belkina, A. C. and Denis, G. V., <i>Nat Rev Cancer </i>12:465-477 (2012)). Since the AR-BRD4 interaction is disrupted by JQ1 (<figref>FIGS. 7-16</figref>), it was explored whether this affects AR localization in a genome-wide context. ChIP-seq with antibodies against AR, BRD4, and RNA PolII in cells that were either starved, treated with DHT, or DHT plus JQ1 (Table 8) were performed. Two anti-androgens, bicalutamide and MDV3100 were used for comparison. The average ChIP-seq signal for AR was highly enriched in DHT-treated cells (<figref>FIG. 17</figref>). Recruitment of AR to target loci was markedly attenuated by MDV3100 and less so by bicalutamide. JQ1 could block AR recruitment to a level almost equivalent to MDV3100 (<figref>FIG. 17</figref>). Furthermore, a co-recruitment of AR and BRD4 at 2031 sites was observed. The strongest association is observed within promoters of AR-regulated genes (502 promoters, p=4e-49), and for the highest AR peaks (1112 sites, p=1e-38) (<figref>FIG. 18</figref>). Limiting the evaluation to AR and BRD4 coincident peaks, it was observed that DHT can mediate AR recruitment to these loci which was inhibited by MDV3100 and to a lesser extent by JQ1 (<figref>FIG. 19</figref>). By contrast, JQ1 almost completely abrogated DHT induced BRD4 recruitment to the AR-BRD4 shared loci (<figref>FIG. 20</figref>). Examples of gene tracks for AR and BRD4 associated genomic regions such as enhancers and super-enhancers (Loven, J. et al., <i>Cell </i>153:320-334 (2013)) and the effects of different treatments on their levels are shown in <figref>FIG. 21</figref>. In corroboration with the ChIP-seq data, gene expression analysis in VCaP and LNCaP cells displayed efficient repression of DHT-induced AR-target genes by JQ1 than MDV3100 or bicalutamide (data not shown).</p>
      <p id="p-01207-en" num="1122">Next, the oncogenic ERG expression in VCaP cells was explored since JQ1-treatment had a marked effect on its expression (<figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>). The attenuation of DHT induced ERG expression by JQ1 was due to de-recruitment of RNA PolII from ERG gene body and reduced binding of AR and BRD4 on the TMPRSS2 promoter/enhancer (data not shown). This efficient ERG downregulation by JQ1 is compelling considering that the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion product is a key oncogenic driver in 50% of prostate cancers (Tomlins, S. A. et al., <i>Science </i>310:644-648 (2005); Chen, Y. et al., <i>Nat Med </i>19:1023-1029 (2013)). Next, the effect of JQ1 on ERG mediated transcription was investigated. Towards this, ERG ChIP-seq in cells treated with JQ1 for 12 h was performed; a time window where ERG protein levels were still unaffected by JQ1 (data not shown). A significant loss in the-top 4% ERG enriched peaks was observed (data not shown). Next, the functional consequence of ERG de-recruitment by testing the expression of several of its target genes after JQ1-treatment was determined (data not shown). The ERG activated genes were down-regulated and ERG repressed genes were de-repressed by JQ1 (data not shown). To confirm the BET-inhibitors role in blocking ERG mediated oncogenic function in an isogenic setting, RWPE and PC3 cells overexpressing ERG were tested (data not shown). Treatment of JQ1 or I-BET762 led to attenuation of ERG-mediated invasion (data not shown) and GSEA demonstrated a highly significant negative enrichment for ERG target genes in these cells upon BET-inhibitor treatment (data not shown). Next, it was investigated whether ERG is involved in the transcriptional regulation of MYC. ERG was found to be highly enriched on the known distal-enhancer of MYC; but was reduced upon JQ1-treatment (data not shown). Likewise, ETV1 occupies the same distal-enhancer region in ETV1 fusion positive LNCaP (Chen, Y. et al., <i>Nat Med </i>19:1023-1029 (2013). Knockdown of ERG and ETV1 along with AR led to MYC down-regulation, implicating ETS transcription factors in the regulation of MYC in fusion-positive prostate cancer cells (data not shown). ChIP-seq analysis of AR and RNA PolII enrichment at the MYC locus presented an interesting pattern where DHT treatment led to increased AR and reduced RNA PolII binding on the MYC distal-enhancer and gene body respectively, that was reinstated in the presence of MDV3100 or bicalutamide but not by JQ1 (data not shown), and this result was supported by the observed concomitant reduction in MYC expression upon DHT treatment that was de-repressed in the presence of MDV3100 but not by JQ1 (data not shown). Lack of de-repression of MYC by JQ1 in this setting could be explained by the fact that both AR and ERG are absent from the MYC distal-enhancer leading to net loss of MYC expression. This data also suggests a mechanism by which CRPC may become resistant to anti-androgen therapy by maintaining expression of the MYC oncogene.</p>
      <p id="p-01208-en" num="1123">JQ1 efficacy in comparison to MDV3100, a direct AR antagonist used clinically for advanced CRPC, was studied (Scher, H. I. et al., <i>N Engl J Med </i>367:1187-1197 (2012)). Before embarking on the in vivo experiment, JQ1 and MDV3100 were tested on VCaP cells in vitro for 8 days. Marginal cell death for MDV3100 versus suppression of cell growth at sub-micromolar concentrations by JQ1 was observed (<figref>FIG. 22</figref>). No effect on physiologic androgen-regulated processes was found suggesting that JQI does not act a generic anti-androgen However, JQ1 reduced testes size in mice as reported earlier (Lin, T. H. et al., <i>Cell Death Dis </i>4:e764 (2013)). (data not shown). Treatment of VCaP tumor-bearing mice with JQ1 led to significant reduction in tumor volume/weight (<figref>FIGS. 23-25</figref>). However, MDV3100 had a less pronounced effect. Recently, several studies described the pro-metastatic effects of MDV3100 in pre-clinical models (Lin, T. H. et al., <i>Cell Death Dis </i>4:e764 (2013)). Whether MDV3100 treatment leads to spontaneous metastasis in the VCaP xenograft model was tested. Towards this, femur, liver and spleen from MDV3100 treated mice were isolated, and evidence of metastases in femur and liver was observed (data not shown). By contrast, JQ1 treated mice displayed no evidence of metastasis (data not shown). Taken together, these pre-clinical studies suggest that the use of MDV3100 in clinically localized prostate cancer may potentiate the formation of micro-metastases, which would not be the case with BET-inhibitors. Consistent with previous reports JQ1 and MDV3100 were well tolerated by mice (data not shown). Although VCaP cells were originally derived from a patient with CRPC, VCaP tumor xenograft respond to castration in mouse models. Whether JQ1 would still have a growth inhibitory effect in castration-resistant VCaP tumor xenografts was studied, and a 50% reduction in these castration-resistant tumors by JQ1-treatment was observed (<figref>FIG. 26</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-01209-en" num="1124">Maintenance of AR signaling has been identified as the most common resistance mechanism that patients with advanced prostate cancer develop after conventional hormonal treatments (Harris, W. P. et al., <i>Nat Clin Pract Urol </i>6:76-85 (2009)). AR amplification, mutation, and alternative splicing have all been suggested as potential resistance mechanisms to anti-androgen treatments (Chen, C. D. et al., <i>Nat Med </i>10:33-39 (2004); Taplin, M. E. et al., <i>Cancer Res </i>59:2511-2515 (1999); Sun, S. et al., <i>J Clin Invest </i>120:2715-2730 (2010)). Over half of CRPC patients have at least one of these aberrations in the AR pathway (Grasso, C. S. et al., <i>Nature </i>487:239-243 (2012). As BET-inhibitors function âdownstreamâ of AR itself (<figref>FIG. 27</figref>), these data suggest that these compounds may be effective in the context of AR directed resistance mechanisms including compensatory mechanisms involving related steroid hormone receptors which are also likely to require BET bromodomain function. By functioning downstream of AR, BET-inhibition is less likely to be affected by acquired resistance associated with AR antagonists, including the recently identified F876L mutation of AR (Balbas, M. D. et al., <i>Elife </i>2:e00499 (2013)). While both MDV3100 and JQ1 block AR recruitment to target loci on a genome-wide scale (the âAR cistromeâ), it was found that JQ1 likely has an enhanced effect by fully abrogating co-recruitment of BRD4, which is required for mobilization of the transcriptional machinery (Jang, M. K. et al., <i>Mol Cell </i>19:523-534 (2005); Yang, Z. et al., <i>Mol Cell </i>19:535-545 (2005)). A recent study demonstrated that BET-inhibition leads to preferential loss of BRD4 at âsuper-enhancersâ and consequent transcriptional elongation defects (Loven, J et al. <i>Cell </i>153:320-334 (2013)). These super-enhancers were often associated with key oncogenic drivers in a variety of cancers. Tumor cells are thought to become addicted to selected oncogenes, and become unusually reliant on their high expression which may explain the preferential sensitivity of BET-inhibition in cancer versus normal tissues. While MYC and its association with multiple myeloma was highlighted as a super-enhancer dependent cancer (Loven, J. et al. <i>Cell </i>153:320-334 (2013)), this framework likely applies to key transcription factors involved in the development of CRPC including AR, ETS, and MYC (<figref>FIG. 27</figref>). Taken together, these data strongly suggest the clinical evaluation of BET-inhibitors is warranted in CRPC, either as monotherapy or in combination with second generation anti-androgens.</p>

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using the JAVA program (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea) as described in Subramanian, A. et al., <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>102:15545-15550 (2005).</p>
      <p id="p-01226-en" num="1141">The AR target gene signature used in GSEA analysis was generated from common up-regulated genes in VCaP and LNCaP upon DHT treatment and the gene list is provided in Table 6.</p>
      <p id="p-01227-en" num="1142">The ERG gene signature was generated by extracting 2-fold up genes from RWPE and PC3 cells stably expressing ERG compared to respective LacZ expressing cells. GSEA was performed using this gene set on gene expression data obtained from the JQ1 and I-BET762 treated RWPE and PC3 cells. GSEA using gene set that were not changed upon expression of ERG to exclude the possibility that treatment with JQ1 and I-BET762 may change gene expression in a non-specific fashion was also tested.</p>

      <p id="p-01228-en" num="1143">The ChIP assays for BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, AR, RNA PolII, ERG and H3K27ac were performed using HighCell ChIP kit (Diagenode) according to manufacturer's protocol. For BRD2/3/4 ChIP-seq experiments with BET inhibitors, VCaP cells were treated with 500 nM JQ1 or I-BET762 for 12 h. For AR signaling ChIP-seq experiments, VCaP cells were grown in charcoal-stripped serum containing media for 48 h followed by 6 h pre-treatment with vehicle or 500 nM JQ1 or 10 Î¼M MDV3100 or 25 Î¼M Bicalutamide and then stimulated with 10 nM DHT for 12 h. For ERG ChIP-seq studies, VCaP cells were treated with 500 nM JQ1 or vehicle for 12 h. Next, cells were cross-linked for 10 min. with 1% formaldehyde. Cross-linking was terminated by the addition of 1/10 volume 1.25 M glycine for 5 min. at room temperature followed by cell lysis and sonication (Bioruptor, Diagenode), resulting in an average chromatin fragment size of 200 bp. Chromatin equivalent to 5Ã10<sup>6 </sup>cells were used for ChIP using different antibodies. ChIP DNA was isolated (IPure Kit, Diagenode) from samples by incubation with the antibody at 4Â° C. overnight followed by wash and reversal of cross-linking. The ChIP-seq sample preparation for sequencing was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina). ChIP-enriched DNA samples (1-10 ng) were converted to blunt-ended fragments using T4 DNA polymerase, <i>E. coli </i>DNA polymerase I large fragment (Klenow polymerase) and T4 polynuleotide kinase (New England BioLabs, NEB). A single A-base was added to fragment ends by Klenow fragment (3â² to 5â² exo minus; NEB) followed by ligation of Illumina adaptors (Quick ligase, NEB). The adaptor-modified DNA fragments were enriched by PCR using the Illumina Barcode primers and Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB). PCR products were size selected using 3% NuSieve agarose gels (Lonza) followed by gel extraction using QIAEX II reagents (QIAGEN). Libraries were quantified with the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencer (100 nucleotide read length).</p>

      <p id="p-01230-en" num="1145">ChIP enrichment levels within a peak (or site) were calculated from the sequencing data as follows: (1) reads were aligned to the HG19 reference genome using Bowtie2 (Langmead, B. and Salzberg, S. L., <i>Nat Methods </i>9:357-359 (2012)) with all default settings. (2) Aligned reads were sorted using NovoSort and exact duplicates were removed using Samtools (Li, H. et al., <i>Bioinformatics </i>25:2078-2079 (2009)). (3) For each peak (site) overlapping reads were counted and this count was divided by the length of the peak or site.

For each replicate peaks were called using MACS with all default setting against an IgG control. Peaks within genomic regions prone to technical-artifacts were exclude (Pickrell, J. K. et al., <i>Bioinformatics </i>27:2144-2146 (2011)). For each replicate pair, a set of concordant peaks as those overlapping in both replicates was defined. For each concordant peak, enrichment levels within the union of the two overlapping peaks were calculated. The scatter plots include all peaks with enrichment levels up-to the 99th percentile.</p>

      <p id="p-01234-en" num="1149">The genome-wide distribution of BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 peaks in DMSO treated VcaP cells was compared. First, peaks for each of the proteins using MACS with all default settings and IgG control were called. A moderately stringent significance cut-off (MACS score&gt;100) was used. Next, all genomic regions that were enriched for at least one of the proteins were identified. Specifically, all stringent peaks were âreducedâ using GenomicRanges (Lawrence, M et al., <i>PLoS Comput Biol </i>9:e1003118 (2013)). For each of those regions, it was established which of the Bromodomain proteins were enriched to count the number of overlaps.</p>

First, for all conditions and proteins, peaks were called as in Overlaps of bromodomain proteins were called. Next, for each protein separately, genomic that were enriched in any (union) of the treatment conditions (DMSO, I-BET762, or JQ1) were identified. Within those regions enrichment levels as described in (ChIP-seq enrichment levels) were quantified. Since enrichment levels of different proteins are not directly comparable, all enrichments to the median level of the (DMSO) control were normalized.</p>

S. et al., <i>BMC Bioinformatics </i>11:369 (2010)) designed for the identification of protein-interactive genomic regions, was employed for ChIP-seq peak determination. For enrichment plots shown in <figref>FIGS. 17</figref>, <b>19</b> and <b>20</b>, identified peaks for each sample are centered by peak summit and average coverage per million was counted within 1500 bp relative to the peak center. The overlap of AR and BRD4 enriched regions were calculated by BEDtools (Quinlan, A. R. and Hall, I. M., <i>Bioinformatics </i>26:841-842 (2010)) The significance of overlap between AR and BRD4 binding was calculated using hypergeometric test based on the derived number of associated genes.

      <p id="p-01240-en" num="1155">Sites with significant differences in ERG levels between DMSO and JQ1 treated cells were identified. First, concordant peaks (see ChIP-seq reproducibility plots) that were overlapping or in the +/â5 kbp proximity of annotated gene loci were identified. A gene locus was defined as the union of all of its known transcripts (Ensembl Genes 73). DESeq2 was used to assess the statistical significance of differences in ERG enrichment levels. Although DESeq2 was originally developed for RNA-seq its statistical model is well-suited to count data in general. The tools' default multiple hypothesis correction method and report peaks with significant differences in ERG levels (adjusted P-value&lt;0.1) was used. To assess quantitative differences in ERG levels at significantly âgainedâ (positive difference in ERG levels upon JQ1 treatment) and âlostâ (negative difference in ERG levels upon JQ1 treatment) the same procedure as in ChIP-seq enrichment levels was followed.</p>

All procedures involving mice were approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA) at the University of Michigan and conform to all regulatory standards. Mice were anesthetized using 2% Isoflurane (inhalation) and 2Ã10<sup>6 </sup>VCaP prostate cancer cells suspended in 100 Î¼l of PBS with 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were implanted subcutaneously into the dorsal flank on both sides of the mice. Once the tumors reached a palpable stage (100 mm<sup>3</sup>), the animals were randomized and treated with either 10 mg/kg body weight MDV3100 or 50 mg/kg body weight (doses previously used in mouse prostate cancer and multiple myeloma models) (Delmore, J. E. et al., <i>Cell </i>146:904-917 (2011); Tran, C. et al., <i>Science </i>324:787-790 (2009)) by oral gavage or intraperitonially respectively for five days a week. Growth in tumor volume was recorded using digital calipers and tumor volumes were estimated using the formula (Ï/6) (LÃW<sup>2</sup>), where L=length of tumor and W=width. Loss of body weight during the course of the study was also monitored. At the end of the studies mice were sacrificed and tumors extracted and weighed. Additionally, femur bone marrow, liver and spleen were harvested to examine spontaneous metastasis by detecting human-Alu sequence. Briefly, genomic DNA from femur bone marrow, liver and spleen were prepared using Puregene DNA purification system (Qiagen), followed by quantification of human ALU sequence by human Alu specific Fluorogenic TaqMan qPCR probes as described (Tran, C. et al., <i>Science </i>324:787-790 (2009); van der Horst, E. H. et al., <i>Biotechniques </i>37:940-942, 944, 946 (2004)). For CRPC experiment, VCaP tumor bearing mice were castrated when the tumors were approximately 200 mm<sup>3 </sup>in size and randomized later once the tumor grew back to the pre-castration size and treated with JQ1 or vehicle (D5W) control.

Standard H&amp;E staining was achieved on the formalin fixed sections and were used to image the different lobes of the gland. To determine the testosterone levels, blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture from mice anesthetized with isoflurane.
