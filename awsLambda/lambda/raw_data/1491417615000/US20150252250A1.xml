      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Water based fracturing fluids are currently utilized on the majority of hydraulic fracturing treatments. These fluids are the systems of choice due to their economics, availability, toxicity and safe handling compared with hydrocarbon systems.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Guar is a natural polymer, and is commonly utilized as a water based gelling agent in fracturing fluids. Guar is a hydrocolloid that swells upon contact with water to provide viscosity and fluid loss control. Due to strong export demands for guar gum and low carryover stocks, the price of guar has risen sharply recently and has made synthetic alternatives more attractive.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Thus, there is a need in the art for the development of synthetic alternatives to naturally guar for use in downhole fluids.</p>

      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The term âpremature breakingâ as used herein refers to a phenomenon in which a gel viscosity becomes diminished to an undesirable extent before all of the fluid is introduced into the formation to be fractured. Thus, to be satisfactory, the gel viscosity should preferably remain in the range from about 50% to about 75% of the initial viscosity of the gel for at least two hours of exposure to the expected operating temperature. Preferably the fluid should have a viscosity in excess of 100 centipoise (cP) at 100 sec<sup>â1 </sup>while injection into the reservoir as measured on a Fann 50 C viscometer in the laboratory.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The term âcomplete breakingâ as used herein refers to a phenomenon in which the viscosity of a gel is reduced to such a level that the gel can be flushed from the formation by the flowing formation fluids or that it can be recovered by a swabbing operation. In laboratory settings, a completely broken, non-crosslinked gel is one whose viscosity is about 10 cP or less as measured on a Model 35 Fann viscometer having a R1B1 rotor and bob assembly rotating at 300 rpm.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The term âamphotericâ refers to surfactants that have both positive and negative charges. The net charge of the surfactant can be positive, negative, or neutral, depending on the pH of the solution.</p>

      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">The term âfracturingâ refers to the process and methods of breaking down a geological formation, i.e. the rock formation around a well bore, by pumping fluid at very high pressures, in order to increase production rates from a hydrocarbon reservoir. The fracturing methods of this invention use otherwise conventional techniques known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The term âproppantâ refers to a granular substance suspended in the fracturing fluid during the fracturing operation, which serves to keep the formation from closing back down upon itself once the pressure is released. Proppants envisioned by the present invention include, but are not limited to, conventional proppants familiar to those skilled in the art such as sand, 20-40 mesh sand, resin-coated sand, sintered bauxite, glass beads, and similar materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The abbreviation âRPMâ refers to relative permeability modifiers.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">The term âsurfactantâ refers to a soluble, or partially soluble compound that reduces the surface tension of liquids, or reduces inter-facial tension between two liquids, or a liquid and a solid by congregating and orienting itself at these interfaces.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">The term âviscoelasticâ refers to those viscous fluids having elastic properties, i.e., the liquid at least partially returns to its original form when an applied stress is released.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The phrase âviscoelastic surfactantsâ or âVESâ refers to that class of compounds which can form micelles (spherulitic, anisometric, lamellar, or liquid crystal) in the presence of counter ions in aqueous solutions, thereby imparting viscosity to the fluid. Anisometric micelles in particular are preferred, as their behavior in solution most closely resembles that of a polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The abbreviation âVASâ refers to a Viscoelastic Anionic Surfactant, useful for fracturing operations and frac packing. As discussed herein, they have an anionic nature with preferred counterions of potassium, ammonium, sodium, calcium or magnesium.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">The term âfoamableâ means a composition that when mixed with a gas forms a stable foam.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The term âfracturing layerâ is used to designate a layer, or layers, of rock that are intended to be fractured in a single fracturing treatment. It is important to understand that a âfracturing layerâ may include one or more than one of rock layers or strata as typically defined by differences in permeability, rock type, porosity, grain size, Young's modulus, fluid content, or any of many other parameters. That is, a âfracturing layerâ is the rock layer or layers in contact with all the perforations through which fluid is forced into the rock in a given treatment. The operator may choose to fracture, at one time, a âfracturing layerâ that includes water zones and hydrocarbon zones, and/or high permeability and low permeability zones (or even impermeable zones such as shale zones) etc. Thus a âfracturing layerâ may contain multiple regions that are conventionally called individual layers, strata, zones, streaks, pay zones, etc., and we use such terms in their conventional manner to describe parts of a fracturing layer. Typically the fracturing layer contains a hydrocarbon reservoir, but the methods may also be used for fracturing water wells, storage wells, injection wells, etc. Note also that some embodiments of the invention are described in terms of conventional circular perforations (for example, as created with shaped charges), normally having perforation tunnels. However, the invention is may also be practiced with other types of âperforationsâ, for example openings or slots cut into the tubing by jetting.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The term âgptâ means gallons per thousand gallons.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The term âpptâ means pounds per thousand gallons.</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The inventors have found that downhole fluids may be formulated using synthetic hydratable polymers replacing natural hydratable polymers so that the compositions are substantially free of natural occurring hydratable polymers or include no natural occurring hydratable polymers.

      <heading id="h-00018-en" level="2">Proppants</heading>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">The proppant type can be sand, intermediate strength ceramic proppants (available from Carbo Ceramics, Norton Proppants, etc.), sintered bauxites and other materials known to the industry. Any of these base propping agents can further be coated with a resin (available from Santrol, a Division of Fairmount Industries, Borden Chemical, etc.) to potentially improve the clustering ability of the proppant. In addition, the proppant can be coated with resin or a proppant flowback control agent such as fibers for instance can be simultaneously pumped. By selecting proppants having a contrast in one of such properties such as density, size and concentrations, different settling rates will be achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">Propping agents or proppants are typically added to the fracturing fluid prior to the addition of a crosslinking agent. However, proppants may be introduced in any manner which achieves the desired result. Any proppant may be used in embodiments of the invention. Examples of suitable proppants include, but are not limited to, quartz sand grains, glass and ceramic beads, walnut shell fragments, aluminum pellets, nylon pellets, and the like. Proppants are typically used in concentrations between about 1 to 8 lbs. per gallon of a fracturing fluid, although higher or lower concentrations may also be used as desired. The fracturing fluid may also contain other additives, such as surfactants, corrosion inhibitors, mutual solvents, stabilizers, paraffin inhibitors, tracers to monitor fluid flow back, and so on.</p>

      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">A suitable crosslinking agent can be any compound that increases the viscosity of the fluid by chemical crosslinking, physical crosslinking, or any other mechanisms. For example, the gellation of a hydratable polymer can be achieved by crosslinking the polymer with metal ions including boron in combination with zirconium, and titanium containing compounds. The amount of the crosslinking agent used also depends upon the well conditions and the type of treatment to be effected, but is generally in the range of from about 0.001 wt. % to about 2 wt. % of metal ion of the crosslinking agent in the hydratable polymer fluid. In some applications, the aqueous polymer solution is crosslinked immediately upon addition of the crosslinking agent to form a highly viscous gel. In other applications, the reaction of the crosslinking agent can be retarded so that viscous gel formation does not occur until the desired time.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">When the synthetic hydratable compositions of this invention include no or substantially no natural hydratable polymers, then viscosity may be increased solely by the addition of a sufficient amount of an aqueous alkali solution to the compositions. When pH goes up to about pH 6 to about pH 10, the viscosity is increased due to the ionization of carboxylic acid group and the formation of ionic interactions with metal ions.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">The boron based crosslinking agents may be selected from the group consisting of boric acid, sodium tetraborate, and mixtures thereof. These are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,514,309. In some embodiments, the well treatment fluid composition may further comprise a proppant.</p>
      <heading id="h-00020-en" level="2">Breakers</heading>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">The term âbreaking agentâ or âbreakerâ refers to any chemical that is capable of reducing the viscosity of a gelled fluid. As described above, after a fracturing fluid is formed and pumped into a subterranean formation, it is generally desirable to convert the highly viscous gel to a lower viscosity fluid. This allows the fluid to be easily and effectively removed from the formation and to allow desired material, such as oil or gas, to flow into the well bore. This reduction in viscosity of the treating fluid is commonly referred to as âbreakingâ Consequently, the chemicals used to break the viscosity of the fluid is referred to as a breaking agent or a breaker. In certain embodiments, the breaker is a salt or a brine solution. In other embodiments, the breaker is an encapsulated salt, where the encapsulating material is designed to degrade after a desire time of exposure to a base fluid or by the addition of an agent that disrupts the encapsulating material releasing the salt. In other embodiments, the breaker is a brine added to the fracturing fluid in an amount sufficient to break the viscosity of the fracturing fluid. The brines may be any brine solution including sodium chloride brines, calcium chloride brines, or other brines capable of reducing the viscosity of the synthetic hydratable polymers used in the fracturing fluids of this invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">There are various methods available for breaking a fracturing fluid or a treating fluid. Typically, fluids break after the passage of time and/or prolonged exposure to high temperatures. However, it is desirable to be able to predict and control the breaking within relatively narrow limits. Mild oxidizing agents are useful as breakers when a fluid is used in a relatively high temperature formation, although formation temperatures of 300Â° F. (149Â° C.) or higher will generally break the fluid relatively quickly without the aid of an oxidizing agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">Examples of inorganic breaking agents for use in this invention include, but are not limited to, persulfates, percarbonates, perborates, peroxides, perphosphates, permanganates, etc. Specific examples of inorganic breaking agents include, but are not limited to, alkaline earth metal persulfates, alkaline earth metal percarbonates, alkaline earth metal perborates, alkaline earth metal peroxides, alkaline earth metal perphosphates, zinc salts of peroxide, perphosphate, perborate, and percarbonate, and so on. Additional suitable breaking agents are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,877,127; 5,649,596; 5,669,447; 5,624,886; 5,106,518; 6,162,766; and 5,807,812, incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, an inorganic breaking agent is selected from alkaline earth metal or transition metal-based oxidizing agents, such as magnesium peroxides, zinc peroxides, and calcium peroxides.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">In addition, enzymatic breakers may also be used in place of or in addition to a non-enzymatic breaker. Examples of suitable enzymatic breakers such as guar specific enzymes, alpha and beta amylases, amyloglucosidase, aligoglucosidase, invertase, maltase, cellulase, and hemi-cellulase are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,806,597 and 5,067,566, incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">A breaking agent or breaker may be used âas isâ or be encapsulated and activated by a variety of mechanisms including crushing by formation closure or dissolution by formation fluids. Such techniques are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,506,734; 4,741,401; 5,110,486; and 3,163,219, incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">The above breaker may also be encapsulated in a polymeric coating that decomposes in the fluids at a predetermined or known rate so that the breaker are release into the system only after the encapsulation agent decomposes or the capsules break under downhole conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">Suitable ester compounds include any ester which is capable of assisting the breaker in degrading the viscous fluid in a controlled manner, i.e., providing delayed breaking initially and substantially complete breaking after well treatment is completed. An ester compound is defined as a compound that includes one or more carboxylate groups: RâCOOâ, wherein R is phenyl, methoxyphenyl, alkylphenyl, C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>11 </sub>alkyl, C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>11 </sub>substituted alkyl, substituted phenyl, or other organic radicals. Suitable esters include, but are not limited to, diesters, triesters, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">An ester is typically formed by a condensation reaction between an alcohol and an acid by eliminating one or more water molecules. Ester may hydrolyze to regenerate the organic acid, which reduces the pH of the fluid, thus decreasing a viscosity of fluid including the synthetic hydratable polymers. Other degradable polymers can be used such as PLA, PGA as delayed acid generator. Since they are solid they can also behave as fluid loss agents. Preferably, the acid is an organic acid, such as a carboxylic acid. A carboxylic acid refers to any of a family of organic acids characterized as polycarboxylic acids and by the presence of more than one carboxyl group. In additional to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, a carboxylic acid may include heteroatoms, such as S, N, P, B, Si, F, Cl, Br, and I. In some embodiments, a suitable ester compound is an ester of oxalic, malonic, succinic, malic, tartaric, citrate, phthalic, ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA), nitrilotriacetic, phosphoric acids, etc. Moreover, suitable esters also include the esters of glycolic acid. The alkyl group in an ester that comes from the corresponding alcohol includes any alkyl group, both substituted or unsubstituted. Preferably, the alkyl group has one to about ten carbon atoms per group. It was found that the number of carbon atoms on the alkyl group affects the water solubility of the resulting ester. For example, esters made from C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2 </sub>alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol, have relatively higher water solubility. Thus, application temperature range for these esters may range from about 120Â° F. to about 250Â° F. (about 49Â° C. to about 121Â° C.). For higher temperature applications, esters formed from C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alcohols, such as n-propanol, butanol, hexanol, and cyclohexanol, may be used. Of course, esters formed from C<sub>11 </sub>or higher alcohols may also be used. In some embodiments, mixed esters, such as acetyl methyl dibutyl citrate, may be used for high temperature applications. Mixed esters refer to those esters made from polycarboxylic acid with two or more different alcohols in a single condensation reaction. For example, acetyl methyl dibutyl citrate may be prepared by condensing citric acid with both methanol and butanol and then followed by acylation.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">Specific examples of the alkyl groups originating from an alcohol include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, iso-butyl, 2-butyl, t-butyl, benzyl, p-methoxybenzyl, m-methoxybenxyl, chlorobenzyl, p-chlorobenzyl, phenyl, hexyl, pentyl, etc. Specific examples of suitable ester compounds include, but are not limited to, triethyl phosphate, diethyl oxalate, dimethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, diethyl maleate, diethyl tartrate, 2-ethoxyethyl acetate, ethyl acetylacetate, triethyl citrate, acetyl triethyl citrate, tetracyclohexyl EDTA, tetra-1-octyl EDTA, tetra-n-butyl EDTA, tetrabenzyl EDTA, tetramethyl EDTA, etc. Additional suitable ester compounds are described, for example, in the following U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,990,978; 3,960,736; 5,067,556; 5,224,546; 4,795,574; 5,693,837; 6,054,417; 6,069,118; 6,060,436; 6,035,936; 6,147,034; and 6,133,205, incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">When an ester of a polycarboxylic acid is used, total esterification of the acid functionality is preferred, although a partially esterified compound may also be used in place of or in addition to a totally esterified compound. In these embodiments, phosphate esters are not used alone. A phosphate ester refers to a condensation product between an alcohol and a phosphorus acid or a phosphoric acid and metal salts thereof. However, in these embodiments, combination of a polycarboxylic acid ester with a phosphate ester may be used to assist the degradation of a viscous gel.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">When esters of polycarboxylic acids, such as esters of oxalic, malonic, succinic, malic, tartaric, citrate, phthalic, ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA), nitrilotriacetic, and other carboxylic acids are used, it was observed that these esters assist metal based oxidizing agents (such as alkaline earth metal or zinc peroxide) in the degradation of fracturing fluids. It was found that the addition of 0.1 L/m<sup>3 </sup>to 5 L/m<sup>3 </sup>of these esters significantly improves the degradation of the fracturing fluid. More importantly, the degradation response is delayed, allowing the fracturing fluid ample time to create the fracture and place the proppant prior to the degradation reactions. The delayed reduction in viscosity is likely due to the relatively slow hydrolysis of the ester, which forms polycarboxylate anions as hydrolysis products. These polycarboxylate anions, in turn, improve the solubility of metal based oxidizing agents by sequestering the metal associated with the oxidizing agents. This may have promoted a relatively rapid decomposition of the oxidizing agent and caused the fracturing fluid degradation.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0110">Generally, the temperature and the pH of a fracturing fluid affects the rate of hydrolysis of an ester. For downhole operations, the bottom hole static temperature (âBHSTâ) cannot be easily controlled or changed. The pH of a fracturing fluid usually is adjusted to a level to assure proper fluid performance during the fracturing treatment. Therefore, the rate of hydrolysis of an ester could not be easily changed by altering BHST or the pH of a fracturing fluid. However, the rate of hydrolysis may be controlled by the amount of an ester used in a fracturing fluid. For higher temperature applications, the hydrolysis of an ester may be retarded or delayed by dissolving the ester in a hydrocarbon solvent. Moreover, the delay time may be adjusted by selecting esters that provide more or less water solubility. For example, for low temperature applications, polycarboxylic esters made from low molecular weight alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, are recommended. The application temperature range for these esters could range from about 120Â° F. to about 250Â° F. (about 49Â° C. to about 121Â° C.). On the other hand, for higher temperature applications or longer injection times, esters made from higher molecular weight alcohols should preferably be used. The higher molecular weight alcohols include, but are not limited to, C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alcohols, e.g., n-propanol, hexanol, and cyclohexanol.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0111">In some embodiments, esters of citric acid are used in formulating a well treatment fluid. A preferred ester of citric acid is acetyl triethyl citrate, which is available under the trade name Citraflex A2 from Morflex, Inc., Greensboro, N.C.</p>

      <heading id="h-00027-en" level="2">Oxygen Control</heading>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0118">The introduction of fracturing fluids downhole often is accompanied by an increase in the oxygen content of downhole fluids due to oxygen dissolved in the introduced water. Thus, the materials introduced downhole must work in oxygen environments or must work sufficiently well until the oxygen content has been depleted by natural reactions. For a system that cannot tolerate oxygen, then oxygen must be removed or controlled in any material introduced downhole. The problem is exacerbated during the winter when the injected materials include winterizers such as water, alcohols, glycols, Cellosolves, formates, acetates, or the like and because oxygen solubility is higher to a range of about 14-15 ppm in very cold water. Oxygen can also increase corrosion and scaling. In CCT (capillary coiled tubing) applications using dilute solutions, the injected solutions result in injecting an oxidizing environment (O<sub>2</sub>) into a reducing environment (CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, organic acids, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0119">Options for controlling oxygen content includes: (1) de-aeration of the fluid prior to downhole injection, (2) addition of normal sulfides to produce sulfur oxides, but such sulfur oxides can accelerate acid attack on metal surfaces, (3) addition of erythorbates, ascorbates, diethylhydroxyamine or other oxygen reactive compounds that are added to the fluid prior to downhole injection; and (4) addition of corrosion inhibitors or metal passivation agents such as potassium (alkali) salts of esters of glycols, polyhydric alcohol ethyloxylates or other similar corrosion inhibitors.

      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0129">Hydration Rate</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0130">Hydration rate is a key parameter to be measured for hydratable polymer systems to determine how much residence time is required before the systems can be pumped down hole. Once the polymer system is dispersed in a base fluid such as a base fluid including 0.2 wt. % to 0.6 wt. % CC120 (choline chloride) in a 2 wt. % KCl (potassium chloride) solution or in seawater, the polymer system's ability to untangle and absorb water dictates its hydration rate. The hydration rate may be controlled by mixing times/peed as well as by the addition of pH adjusters such as hexamethylenediamine (HMD), hexamethyleneimine (HMI), or a 50 wt. % sodium hydroxide solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0131">The hydration rates for each synthetic polymer system tested at different concentrations with addition of a pH adjuster in different base fluids are presented below. The present synthetic polymer systems were designed to achieve sufficient viscosity to suspend proppants at the fastest hydration rate possible. In certain embodiments, the sufficient viscosity is about 350 cP (centipoise), which means that the synthetic polymer systems behave similar to traditional natural guar systems.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0132">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a system including 0.25 wt. % of P1, 0.2 wt. % CC120, and 0.25 vol. % of HMI afforded a viscosity of 350 cP or above, a viscosity sufficient to suspend proppants. With about 3 minutes of mixing, a sufficient mixing time, the P1 polymer within the fluid had already fully hydrated, which suggests the hydration time (or a hydration unit) may be shortened or eliminated in the field operations. In fluid that contain higher concentrations of CC120, 0.4 wt. % and 0.6 wt. %, a higher amount of the P1 polymer was needed to attain a sufficient viscosity. Even though, as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the mixing time was between 3 and 5 minutes and was sufficient for reaching a sufficient proppant suspension viscosity.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0133">As shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, a 1.2 wt. % P1 system reached 97% of its maximum viscosity in 3 minutes and 99% of its maximum viscosity in 15 minutes with mixing at room temperature (i.e., a temperature between 20Â° C. and 25Â° C.). The pH of the system was adjusted to neutral (i.e., a pH between 6 and 7) using a 50 wt. % sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0134">As shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, a 1.2 wt. % P2 system was tested in 2% Kcl at different concentrations of added baseâa 50 wt. % sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. The data showed that low concentrations of added base lowered the P2 system viscosity. The ability to adjust viscosity of the P2 system by adjusting the amount of base added may be beneficial in field operations lowering the risk of plugging of hoses in the low and high pressure lines as opposed to adding a full dose of baseâa 50 wt. % sodium hydroxide solution to the P2 system at one time.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0135">As shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, a 2.5 wt. % P2 system was tested in seawater. The P2 system reached 80% of its maximum viscosity in 5 minutes and 91% of its maximum viscosity in 15 minutes with mixing at room temperature (i.e., 20Â° C.-25Â° C.). The pH of the system was adjusted to a pH between 5 and 6 using 1.05 vol. % of a 50 wt. % sodium hydroxide solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0136">In traditional natural polymer systems such as guar systems, the hydration time required to reach maximum viscosity in approximately half an hour. Thus, the hydration rates for the synthetic polymer systems P1 and P2 are much faster requiring only between 3 and 5 minutes in 2% KCl and seawater.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0137">As shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the performance of a 1.0 wt. % P3 system was tested in 2 wt. % KCl. The P3 system reached 90% of its maximum viscosity in about 45 minutes. The pH of the system was adjusted to a pH between 5 and 6 using 1.25 vol. % of a 50 wt. % sodium hydroxide solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0138">As shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the performance of a 1.3 wt. % P3 system was tested in 2 wt. % KCl. The P3 system reached 90% of its maximum viscosity in about 45 minutes. The pH of the system was adjusted to a pH between 5 and 6 using a 50 wt. % sodium hydroxide solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0139">As shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, the performance of a 1.5 wt. % P3 system was tested in 2 wt. % KCl. The P3 system reached 90% of its maximum viscosity in about 45 minutes. The pH of the system was adjusted to a pH between 5 and 6 using a 50 wt. % sodium hydroxide solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0140">Thus, by controlling the amount of each synthetic polymers used in a system and the type of exact synthetic polymers used in a system, the hydrate rate may be adjusted to suit any desired downhole environment or any desired viscosity profile for a given fracturing operation.</p>
      <heading id="h-00032-en" level="2">Effect of pH</heading>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0141">The effect of pH was also studied before breakers testing in order to determine the optimal pH range for formulating the fluid systems of this invention. The pH was varied by the addition of different amounts of a 50 wt. % sodium hydroxide solution, viscosities measured at 100 /sec shear were observed at different pH values at room temperature. <figref>FIG. 9</figref> shows the effect of pH on P1-P5 systems at room temperature in a 2 wt. % KCl base fluid. <figref>FIG. 10</figref> shows the effect of pH on P1-P5 systems at room temperature a seawater base fluid. The data shows usable pH ranges for the five synthetic polymers system P1-P5 in both 2 wt. KCl and seawater.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0142">As shown in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, the effect of pH on a P2 system at room temperature by neutralizing the P2 system with 50 wt. % sodium hydroxide solution in a 2 wt. % KCl base fluid. The data showed that at a pH of about 5.5, the P2 fluid system starts hydrating quickly. From pH 6 to 7.5, the P2 fluid system is still hydrating and higher viscosities were also obtained. When a small amount of a 50 wt. % sodium hydroxide solution was added to the P2 fluid system, pH shoots up usually from 7 to 12 quickly, while viscosity increases more slowly. As more and more sodium hydroxide solution was added to the system, pH increases, while fluid viscosities started to drop. This suggested that the best hydration range for this synthetic polymer fluid systems of this invention is around at a pH range between 6 and 7.5. Adding too much pH adjuster does not help in increasing viscosity drastically, but the fluids become corrosive.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0143">
        <figref>FIG. 12</figref> shows the effect of pH on P2 at room temperature by neutralizing with a 50 wt. % sodium hydroxide solution in seawater. In the seawater, the data showed that viscosity peaks at a pH between about 5 and about 6, and at pH 12 and above. Even though at pH above 12 the fluids gave very high viscosities, a very large amount of pH adjuster was needed to be added into the system, which makes the systems very corrosive, and possibly harder to break.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0144">In fluids including 0.6 wt. % CC120 base fluids, all tested synthetic polymer fluid systems appear high in viscosity at a pH range between 6 and 11. In fluids including 2 wt. % KCl base fluids, all tested synthetic polymer fluid systems were observed that at around pH 6, viscosities shoot up from 100 cP.</p>
      <heading id="h-00033-en" level="2">Gel Stability and Temperature Effect</heading>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0145">P1 fluid system performance was tested at various temperatures to ascertain how much thermal thinning would occur. A P1 system including 0.40 wt. % P1, 0.60% CC120, and 0.45 vol. % HMI was used for testing gel stability and break profiles. As shown in <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, gel viscosity stability, without any breakers, was tested at 60Â° C., 80Â° C. and 100Â° C. on a Brookfield PVS instrument. The data showed that at 60Â° C., the viscosity of the P1 fluid system stabilized at 300 cP within a 2-hour period. The data showed that at 80Â° C., the viscosity of the P1 fluid system stabilized at around 260 cP within a 2-hour period. The data showed that at 100Â° C., the viscosity of the P1 fluid system stabilized at around 190 cP within a 2-hour period. The data demonstrated the temperature viscosity dependent of P1 systems.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0146">Gel stability tests were run for a 2 hour period to check if any thermal thinning occurred in the P1-P5 gelled synthetic polymer fluid systems of this invention. As shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, the gel stability of P1-P5 at various concentration are shown at 80Â° C. The data showed that all polymer systems had stable viscosities with minimal thinning at 80Â° C.</p>

The viscosities stabilized at around 266 cP at 25Â° C.; 250 cP at 80Â° C.; 202 cP at 100Â° C.; and 133 cP at 149Â° C., respectively.</p>

The viscosities stabilized at around 256 cp at 25Â° C.; 278 cP at 80Â° C.; 238 cP at 100Â° C.; and 153 cP at 149Â° C., respectively.</p>

The viscosities stabilized at around 580 cP at 80Â° C.; 500 cP at 100Â° C.; and between 205-280 cP at 149Â° C., respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0150">As shown in <figref>FIG. 18</figref>, the temperature effect on a fluid system including 1.2 wt. % P2 and 0.65 vol % of 50% sodium hydroxide in 2% KCl base fluid at a pH of about 6.5 showed that the system had a stable viscosity within the same temperature at least for the first 2 hours, and temperature varied between 40Â° C. and 149Â° C. Fluid stabilized at around 368 cP at 40Â° C.; 341 cP at 65Â° C.; 325 cP at 85Â° C.; 278 cP at 100Â° C.; 228 cP at 120Â° C.; and 210 cP at 149Â° C., respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0151">Further breakers test were based on this P2 system in the 2% KCl system, which requires lesser amounts of P2 to achieve a viscosity of 350 cP for proppant suspension requirements.</p>

      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0160">If lower breaking temperatures are required, B3 may be used for breaking the gelled systems of this invention. The results demonstrated that encapsulated breakers are effective in breaking the synthetic polymer based fluids of this invention. However, due to the unique nature of the synthetic polymer based systems of this invention, encapsulated breaker concentrations, mixtures and breakdown characteristics may be controlled to provide a desired breaking profile for each synthetic polymer based fluid system of this invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0161">At 65Â° C., some of the encapsulated breakers the outercoating of resins or lipids start degrading, therefore their encapsulated chemicals start breaking the fluids according to their mechanisms. B3 is an encapsulated ammonium persulfate with cured acrylic resin and crystalline-quartz silica coating and B8 is an encapsulated citric acid with cured resin coating. B7 is an encapsulated ammonium persulfate.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0162">As shown in <figref>FIG. 23</figref>, 2 wt. % B7 produced a nice breaking profile for a P2 system with a 60 minutes time delay for proppant suspension and was able to break this system in 3 hours.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0163">As shown in <figref>FIG. 24</figref>, different concentrations of B3 were able to hold a P2 system at a fluid viscosity high enough (&gt;200 cP) to suspend proppants for about 40-50 minutes; and then start breaking down the P2 system to viscosity of 10 cP. B3 can hold viscosity &gt;200 cP for about 43 minutes at 0.5 wt. % and for about 30 minutes at 2 wt. % of B3 at 80Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0164">As shown in <figref>FIG. 25</figref>, 2 wt. % of B4, B5, B6, and B8 breaking profiles are shown in a 1.2 wt. % P2 system over a 175 minute period. Breaker B8 is more effective that breakers B4, B5 and B6, with B5 having a longer breaking profile than B6, which has a longer breaker profile than B4.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0165">2 wt. % B8 broke the P2 system in about 88 minutes, which suggested that we can further lower the B8 concentration to prolong its breaking profile. As shown in <figref>FIG. 26</figref>, different concentrations of B8 were tested in the P2 system at 100Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0166">The results showed that at B8 concentration of 0.75 wt. % or above, the P2 fluids may be broken at 100Â° C. At 0.75 wt. % B8, the P2 fluid viscosity was kept higher than 200 cP for about 32 minutes, and was completely broken at 132 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0167">As shown in <figref>FIG. 27</figref>, the breaking profiles with varying concentrations of B8 at 120Â° C. from 0.1 wt. % to 0.5 wt. %, similar encapsulation strength may be seen once temperature started going up to 120Â° C. With 0.5 wt. % B8, the P2 fluid was broken down to 10 cP in 130 minutes; while lowering the concentration of B8 at 120Â° C. to 0.1 wt. % and 0.25 wt. %, no fluid breaking was observed. These results suggest that the outer cured resin does not adequately degrade at temperatures lower than 120Â° C.; and encapsulated material ammonium persulfate at 0.5 wt. % is sufficient to break the P2 fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0168">As shown in <figref>FIG. 28</figref>, the breaking profiles with varying concentrations of B5 from 0.5 wt. % to 2.5 wt. % at 120Â° C. was similar to the breaking profile of B8, which has a similar encapsulation strength, was observed in which B5 can hold a viscosity of 200 cP or above for about 20-40 minutes at 120Â° C. However, with 2.5 wt. % B5 did not completely break down to 10 cP, but was lowered to 24 cP in 3 hours.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0169">As shown in <figref>FIG. 29</figref>, the effect of B8 on fluid viscosity at 149Â° C. over 2 hours with varying concentrations of B8 from 0.5 wt. % to 2 wt. % at 149Â° C. was observed to hold a viscosity of 200 cP or above for less than 10 minutes at 149Â° C. Even with the 0.5 wt. % concentration, suspension viscosity dropped too soon. This suggests that lowering B8 concentration is possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0170">In summary, breaking profiles were observed under 300 psi at different temperatures on Brookfield PVS. Further lowering breaker concentrations are possible, and improvement of the fluid system may be advanced. Table III, Table IV, Table V, Table VI, and Table VII show the summary of fluids when applying breakers at 40Â° C., 65Â° C., 80Â° C., 100Â° C., 120Â° C., and 149Â° C., respectively.</p>

      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0171">Before applying this synthetic polymer gel system to field operation, commonly used fracturing additives were verified to see if they are compatible with the fluids. Commonly used fracturing additives are acids, biocide, breaker, clay stabilizer, crosslinker, fluid loss control, foamer, iron control, pH adjuster, non-emulsifier, proppants, solvent, etc. Exceptions are strong mineral acids and organic acids such as acetic acid, formic acid, and hydrochloric acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0172">Additives that we have tested on this synthetic polymer include WNE-363, BioClear 2000, WGS-160L, and WCS-631LC. Formulation of fluid contains 1.2 wt. % P2 with 0.65 vol % of 50% NaOH in 2% KCl brine. Fluid was tested individually with additive at 100Â° C. to demonstrate the stability of fluid. Table VIII shows additives and their concentrations for testing.</p>

      <heading id="h-00036-en" level="2">Proppant Carrying Capability Comparison</heading>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0179">In order to assess the sand carrying capabilities we loaded different viscosity synthetic gels and compared them to a conventional crosslinked borate system that is commonly used. The systems were placed in a waterbath at 80Â° C. and removed after 30 minutes and 2 hours to assess how much sand had settled.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0180">Guar (0.625%) with KCl (2%), WPB-584L (0.05%), and BXL-10 (0.075%): Brookfield viscosity is 400 cP at 100/s at 80Â° C. The sand settled at the bottom of the jar within 30 minutes at the 80Â° C. water-bath.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0181">P1 (0.30%) with CC120 (0.60%), and HMI (0.30%): Ofite 900 viscosity is 134 cP at 100 /s at room temperature. Play sand slightly settled at the lower part of the jar in 2 hours at the 80Â° C. water-bath.</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0182">P1 (0.30%) with CC120 (0.60%), and HMI (0.35%): Ofite 900 viscosity is 209 cP at 100 /s at room temperature. Play sand did not settle in the jar within 2 hours at the 80Â° C. water-bath.</p>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0183">P1 (0.30%) with CC120 (0.60%), and HMI (0.40%): Ofite 900 viscosity is 252 cP at 100 /s at room temperature. Play sand did not settle in the jar within 2 hours at the 80Â° C. water-bath.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0184">P1 (0.30%) with CC120 (0.60%), and HMI (0.45%): Ofite 900 viscosity is 325 cP at 100 /s at room temperature. Play sand did not settle in the jar within 2 hours at the 80Â° C. water-bath.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0185">The results clearly show the superior suspension capabilities of the synthetic polymer system even when using a lower viscosity over the conventional Dynafrac system. The use of lower viscosity fluids could enable lower pump pressures due to the reduction in friction pressure as the fluid is pumped down hole.</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0186">Another synthetic polymer P2, was also used for formulating the fluid in 2% KCl system. Proppant suspension capability of its fluid was compared with our conventional Dynafrac and xanthan gum systems. CARBO Ceramics's CARBO-HSP 20/40 with a specific gravity of 3.56 was used for this suspension test for comparison.</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0187">Results are showing below in <figref>FIGS. 36&amp;37</figref> at room temperature and 80Â° C. respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0188">At room temperature, 20Â° C.-25Â° C., both P2 and conventional Dynafrac natural polymers could suspend proppants over 22 hours. While with xanthan drops half of its suspension viscosity in 5 hours.</p>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0189">With the same formulation, while temperature rose to 80Â° C., the conventional Dynafrac gel started to drop half of its suspension viscosity in 4 hours; and fluid with xanthan drops half of its suspension viscosity in 30 minutes at 80Â° C. On the other hand, the fluid with synthetic polymer P2 suspension viscosity stays over 22 hours at 80Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0190">Proppant suspension capabilities were tested for fluids including 1 wt. % P2 and 0.65 vol % of 50% NaOH having different viscosities at 100 /sec on OFITE 900 at room temperature and 80Â° C. respectively. The tested viscosities of the fluids were: 51.7 cP, 121.4 cP, 205 cP, and 262 cP. Most proppants dropped to the bottom at 51.7 cP within 10 minutes at 80Â° C. Most proppants dropped to the bottom at 121.4 cP in less than 3 hours at 80Â° C. Proppants appeared sticking on the glass wall while many of them had dropped down to the bottom. Proppants were suspended at the beginning and showed only a minor drop of proppants from the top at 205 cP after 24 hours at 80Â° C. Proppants suspension of 262 cP fluid at 80Â° C. at the beginning and after 24 hours, respectively showed no proppant dropping.</p>
      <heading id="h-00037-en" level="1">CONCLUSIONS</heading>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0191">Various formulations of the synthetic polymers were tested in three different systems: 0.2%-0.6% CC120, 2% KCl, and seawater. A minimum of 0.25 wt. % of P1 was used, with CC120 and HMI, to achieve a neutral pH fluid with the highest viscosity, i.e., 380 cP at room temperature from the OFITE Model 900. A minimum of 1.2 wt. % of P2 was used, with 2% KCl and 50% NaOH, to achieve a neutral pH fluid with the highest viscosity, i.e., 380 cP at room temperature from the OFITE Model 900. A minimum of 2.5 wt. % of P2 was used, with seawater and 50%-sodium hydroxide, to achieve a neutral pH fluid with the highest viscosity, i.e., 630 cP at room temperature from the OFITE Model 900. The minimum recommended hydration time is 3 minutes for the dry polymer to reach 90% of the highest viscosity for CC120 and 2% KCl systems at room temperature; and 5 minutes for the seawater system. The system is extremely sensitive to inorganic salts and further work is required to see if there is any way to improve this or look at other polymers from this family. The systems showed excellent fluid stability over a broad temperature range.</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0192">Additives for breakers have been found but further work is required to look in to different encapsulating additives with lower dosages over a broad range of temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0193">The system showed excellent compatibility with commonly used fracturing additives. The systems showed superior suspension capabilities over the standard borate system with lower polymer concentrations and viscosity.</p>
