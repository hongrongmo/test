  <abstract id="abstr_eng" date-changed="20150903" lang="eng" format="original">
    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">A cough detection, analysis, and communication platform may be provided. The platform may comprise methods, systems, and devices for detecting, analyzing, and communicating cough detection data. A cough detection device may comprise at least one microphone and analytic firmware used to employ methods of detecting, analyzing, and communicating the cough detection data. The analytic software may be updated to use the appropriate algorithms for an individual or corresponding demographic based on, for example, age and disease, with abnormal cough frequency components, abnormal cough frequency profiles, and alert thresholds. The cough detection device may be configured to communicate cough detection data to a server. The server, in turn, may be operative to process and communicate the data to a third party, such as, for example, a physician. Systems may further be operative to provide a user interface (e.g., mobile or web applications) for interfacing with the platform.</p>

      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The technical field of the present disclosure generally relates to medical devices and remote health-care services.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Patients who have chronic lung disease may experience regular coughing. Sudden increases in their regular coughing frequencies may be an early indicator of respiratory compromise (infection) or impending exacerbation event such as, for example, an asthma attack for people with asthma. In various cases (e.g., Cystic Fibrosis, Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchitis, Respiratory infection, Lung Cancer, Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), and other diseases affecting normal lung operation), a strong indicator of respiratory compromise is an increase in cough frequency which may be due to pathophysiology in the lungs from increasing cough sensitivity and a response to cell influx into lungs. For example, in an impending asthma attack coughing may be an increase in a patients coughing rate from a regular rate of, for example, approximately one cough per two hours to a much higher rate. This increased cough frequency may begin to occur approximately three hours before an exacerbation event (âthe attackâ) in normal case or, for hypersensitive individuals, as late as half an hour before the attack.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Doctor supplied treatment plans have an intervention strategy to prevent a full blown attack at the sign of worsening symptoms (e.g. the increased cough rate). However, these treatment plans may only work if the doctor or patient are aware of the worsening symptoms and act upon this in a timely manner timely act upon this.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">An early warning may encourage the patient to seek early treatment. Early treatment, in turn, with rescue medication (e.g., an inhaler) or removal of the exacerbation trigger (e.g., emotional stress such as crying, air pollution, etc.) may impede the full impact of the exacerbation event. Impeding the full impact of the exacerbation event may decrease the likelihood of emergency room visits and hospitalizations for the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Unfortunately some patients, such as children and the elderly, often ignore their early symptoms until early treatment measures are no longer effective, making conventional intervention strategies more likely to fail. Consequently, there is a need for effective and efficient early symptom detection devices that operate passively with minimal patient intervention or noticeability.</p>

It should be understood that these headers are used as references and are not to be construed as limiting upon the subjected matter disclosed under the header.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">I. Detection Device Design</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Embodiments of the present disclosure may provide a cough frequency detection device operative to detect, analyze, and communicate a user's coughing frequency. The detection device may be further operative to provide an indication upon a detection of an increased coughing rate. The indication may serve as an early warning of a physiological cascade of lung problems leading to an exacerbation event. The exacerbation event may be, for example, but not be limited to, an asthma attack.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The detection device may be integrated with, by way of non-limiting example, a pendant, watch, pocket FOB, an adhesive sleeve or patch, and a zipper attached FOB.

The detection device may be small, portable, and have a substantially long battery life. In some embodiments, the detection device may be rechargeable, while in other embodiments the detection device may be disposable.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">
        <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref> illustrates various embodiments of the cough detection device. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, detection device <b>100</b> may be worn by a user around a user's neck. Detection device <b>100</b> may be integrated into various accessories that may be configured to be worn by a user.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">For example, in some embodiments, the device <b>100</b> may be integrated with a housing <b>105</b>, a bracing means <b>110</b> and a clasp <b>115</b>. Housing <b>100</b> may be comprised of, but not limited to, for example, a rubber and/or plastic material designed to a house the device components for providing and interfacing with the methods and systems of the present disclosure. The bracing means <b>105</b> may provide a mechanism to secure device <b>100</b> to the user.

      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">
        <figref>FIG. 2B</figref> yet further embodiments of the present disclosure, the detection device may be designed as an adhesive sleeve or patch <b>200</b>B. Patch <b>200</b>B may be an adhesive material designed to adhere to, for example, a user's body (e.g., directly to the user's skin). Patch <b>200</b>B may form a pocket in which detection module <b>205</b> may be placed. An antenna <b>220</b> may be wrapped around a circumference of patch <b>200</b>B or detection module <b>205</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">
        <figref>FIG. 2C</figref> illustrates an embodiment <b>200</b>C in which patch <b>200</b>B is attached to a user's back. <figref>FIG. 2D</figref> illustrates an embodiment <b>200</b>D in which patch <b>200</b>B is attached to a user's sternum. Such form factor of the adhesive sleeve or patch <b>200</b>B may enable detection module <b>205</b> to detect sounds more precisely as well as additional sounds that may not be detectable with other form factors (e.g., breathing rates). It should be understood that embodiments <b>200</b>C and <b>200</b>D are examples and that the adhesive sleeve may be applied to other portions of the user's body.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">
        <figref>FIGS. 3A-3C</figref> illustrate additional embodiments of a detection device. Detection device <b>300</b> may be comprised of a detection module <b>305</b> having a housing for the detection device components. The housing may be configured to be inserted into a socket <b>310</b> comprised of, for example, a mounting ring <b>310</b>. Mounting ring <b>315</b> may be configured to attach to, for example, a user accessory <b>330</b>. In some embodiments, mounting ring <b>315</b> may comprise a port <b>320</b>. Port <b>320</b> may serve as an attachment means to detection device <b>300</b>. In some embodiments, the port <b>320</b> may be configured to couple detection module <b>300</b> into an electronic interface such as, for example, but not limited to a snap-in power receptacle or communications interface (e.g., electronics module <b>325</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In various other embodiments, the detection device of the present disclosure may be associated with a software. The software be embodied in, for example, a mobile application, a web application, a server application, and/or a desktop application. Through communication means detailed at least with reference to <figref>FIG. 4</figref> below, the software may be configured to provide and display a plurality of reports associated with the data received from the detection device. The reports may include, for example, a combination for graphical and textual elements representing data gathered from the detection device and other processed metrics. Additionally, the reports may be integrated with information from other measuring/monitoring devices to help clarify underlying causes (e.g., a FitbitÂ® report identifying exercise level).</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The software may be further configured to send alerts (e.g., telecommunications including, but not limited to, for example, email, SMS, telephonic alerts) to selected parties. The selected parties may comprise, but not be limited to, friends and relatives, emergency contacts, or the user's physicians who have interest in the user's health condition. Through the software, a user may define a plurality of third parties that are to be contacted in the event an increased cough rate has been detected by the device. Furthermore, the user may configure a message to be communicated to those third parties along with the data.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As will be further detailed below, the software may enable a user to adjust various settings associated with the device, including, but not limited to, for example, a base-line waveform, threshold detection levels, communication rules, alert settings, permitted parties, and the like. In some embodiments, the software may be installed onto a mobile computing device (e.g., a smartphone) in operative communication with the device. In some embodiments, the software may be embodied in an apparatus such as, for example, a baby-monitoring device. The software may be operative with various elements of the mobile computing device, such as, but not limited to, microphones, global positioning elements, cell tower communication, accelerometers, internet connectivity and audio, visual, and tactile feedback mechanisms.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Still consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure, the location of the detection device may be tracked using, for example, global positioning elements of the mobile computing device in communication with the detection device. In turn, the cough detection information received with the detection device may be associated with the user's location as derived from the mobile computing device. Having the user's location, a third party who may receive an alert issued by the detection device may be better enabled to provide emergency on-site assistance to the user. Similarly, in some embodiments, a microphone of the mobile computing device may be used in conjunction with a microphone of the detection device. Employing both microphones as a source of input may lead to better cough detections.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In various embodiments, the software may further comprise an individual's personalized treatment plan, for example, a person's asthma action plan. The asthma action plan may provide helpful guidance to the user to properly interpret and act upon symptoms. Moreover, the software may be configured to display predictive analytics associated with the cough detection information. These analytics may be provided by a third-party physician, for example, or computationally derived by the external device.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure, the user's physician may access the software (via, for example, the web application) to review the information received and derived from the user's detection device. In turn, the physician may diagnose and prescribe a treatment for the user. The prescribed treatment may serve as an input to the software, which, in turn, may be communicated to the user by means of, for example, the user's mobile application.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">II. Operating Environment</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an embodiment of an operating environment <b>400</b> for the cough detection, analysis, and communications platform of the present disclosure. The platform may comprise detection devices <b>405</b>. Detection devices <b>405</b> may be, for example, the cough detection devices described with reference <figref>FIG. 1-3</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Detection devices <b>405</b> may comprise a communications module operative to communicate cough detection data to a centralized server <b>410</b>. The communications module may be enabled to communicate using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cell-tower, broadband, and other telecommunications circuitry to provide communication with centralized server <b>410</b>. Centralized server <b>410</b> may be in operative communication with detection devices <b>405</b> via, for example, a telecommunications channel such as, but not limited to, for example, local area network, a wide area network, an internet connection, an/or a cloud computing environment.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Not shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, detection devices <b>405</b> may be further configured to employ an intermediary channel in order to connect to server <b>410</b>. For example, the communications module of detection devices <b>405</b> may only be configured for interaction in a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi communications protocol, yet, in some embodiments, centralized server <b>410</b> may not accessible through these protocols. Accordingly, detection devices <b>405</b> may employ a Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth enabled communications module to communicate data to a mobile computing device (e.g., the user's smartphone or other bridge device with limited functionality, including, but no limited to, for example, Bluetooth, cellular radio, GPS, and power supply). The mobile computing device may have mobile application of the platform the installed thereon. In turn, the mobile computing device may be configured communicate the data received from the detection device to centralized server <b>410</b>, receive data from centralized server <b>410</b>, and provide data back to the detection device <b>405</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Server <b>410</b> may be operative to process the data received from the detection device <b>405</b> (either directly or indirectly through the mobile computing device) and communicate the processed data in accordance to the various embodiments of the present disclosure. The processed data may be received at a user-interface (UI) <b>415</b> consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure. As mentioned above, UI <b>415</b> accessible by the user of the device or a third party, such as, for example, a physician, administrator, relative, or the detection device user via, for example, a web application or a mobile application consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">III. Platform Operation</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">
        <figref>FIG. 5A</figref> is a flow chart setting forth the general stages involved in a method <b>500</b> consistent with embodiments of the disclosure for providing the cough detection, analysis, and communications platform of the present disclosure. Still consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure, method <b>500</b> may be implemented by a combination of hardware elements (e.g., counters, timers, FPGA chips, etc.) and/or software elements (e.g., smartphone application, firmware, etc.) as shown in <figref>FIGS. 9A-9B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Moreover, in some embodiments, method <b>500</b> may be performed by computing device <b>1000</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>. In these embodiments, detection device <b>405</b> may serve as remote microphone that transmits a signal to the computing device <b>1000</b> (e.g., a mobile computing device/users smartphone via a Bluetooth connection) which may then, in turn, perform the processing and communications of method <b>500</b>. In other embodiments, a portion of the processing disclosed in method <b>500</b> may be performed by the detection device <b>405</b>, while a portion of the processing may be performed by the mobile computing device or bridge device in operative communication with the detection device <b>405</b>. In yet further embodiments, method <b>500</b> may be performed by device <b>405</b> in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Though the stages illustrated by the flow charts are disclosed in a particular order, it should be understood that the order is disclosed for illustrative purposes only. Stages may be combined, separated, reordered, and various intermediary stages may exist. Accordingly, it should be understood that the various stages illustrated within the flow chart may be, in various embodiments, performed in arrangements that differ from the ones illustrated. Moreover, various stages may be added or removed from the flow charts without altering or deterring from the fundamental scope of the depicted methods and systems disclosed herein. Ways to implement the stages of method <b>500</b> will be described in greater detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The method may begin at stage <b>505</b> where detection device <b>405</b> may be turned on. Device <b>405</b> may be turned on by activation of an on-off switch or activating a battery contact. In embodiments where the device <b>405</b> is configured to be in communication with a proximately located mobile computing device (e.g., a user's smartphone), device <b>405</b> may be registered with the mobile computing device once turned on. In certain embodiments of the present disclosure, device <b>405</b> may always be on, but running in a passive detection state.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Upon detecting a trigger in the passive detection state, device <b>405</b> may enter an active detection state. The trigger may comprise, but not be limited to, for example, a microphone pick-up of a sound exceeding a predetermined threshold. The sound may be an indication of a disease exacerbation trigger. Once triggered, device <b>405</b> may be configured to operate at the active detection state for a preset period of time.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">In the active detection state, a counter and a timer may be set to a value of <b>0</b>, and cough detection may begin at stage <b>510</b>. A microphone input of device <b>405</b> may be used to detect sounds. As will be described with greater detail below with reference to <figref>FIGS. 6-8</figref>, a software or firmware running on the device may employ various cough detection algorithms to distinguish coughs from other detected sounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Once a sound exceeding the threshold is detected, device <b>405</b> may proceed to stage <b>515</b> where it may employ the cough detection algorithms to determine whether the detected sound comprises a cough. The cough detection algorithms may be further configured to ascertain whether the detected sound is likely to be a cough. Although an exact detection may not always be made, an approximation or estimate may be still be useful in some applications of the present disclosure (e.g., where the coughing rate is so high that misrecognition may be a non-issue).</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">If it is determined that the detected sound is not a cough, device <b>405</b> may return to detection stage <b>510</b>. If it is determined that the detected sound is a cough, device <b>405</b> may proceed to stage <b>120</b> where it may register the cough by incrementing a counter.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">From stage <b>520</b> where the counter is incremented, device <b>405</b> may advance to stage <b>525</b> where it checks the timer to determine if the predetermined period of time has expired. If detection time has not expired, the device returns to detection stage <b>510</b>, and the timer continues to run while the counter continues to be incremented for each detected cough. If detection time has expired, device <b>405</b> may proceed to stage <b>530</b> where it determines whether the cough counter has exceeded a preset threshold. If the cough counter has exceeded the threshold, device <b>405</b> may proceed to stage <b>535</b> where it transmits the cough count to server <b>410</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Consistent with various embodiments, device <b>405</b> may be configured to transmit other data in addition to the cough count, such as, but not limited to, historical count information, time information, and location information. As will be detailed below, the transmitted data may comprise a waveform of the detected sounds or an interpretation of the waveform. Moreover, in embodiments where device <b>405</b> is configured with other health monitoring utilities, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels, the device may be operative to transmit corresponding readings with those utilities as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">As mentioned above, device <b>405</b> may communicate with server <b>410</b> via an intermediary channel provided by a mobile computing device in communication with device <b>405</b>. For example, device <b>405</b> may provide data to the mobile computing device, which may then, in turn, relay the data to a cloud-based server or third parties defined by the user. In various other embodiments, device <b>405</b> may be operative to transmit data directly to server <b>410</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Once the information is transmitted, device <b>405</b> may advance to stage <b>540</b> where it may reset the timer and cough counter, and proceed to stage <b>510</b> where it may continue in the active detection state for another cycle. In some embodiments, the cough counter may not be reset, and the threshold in stage <b>530</b> may be compared to a second threshold corresponding to a two period cycle of detection.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure, different cough count and time combinations may correspond to different signals being transmitted by device <b>405</b>. For example, if a first quantity of coughs were detected in a first cycle (e.g., six coughs were detected in the first fifteen minute cycle) and another quantity of coughs were detected in the second cycle (e.g., six coughs were detected in a second fifteen minute cycle), a first signal may be transmitted. Similarly, if, for example, ten coughs were detected in the first fifteen minute cycle and another fifteen coughs were detected in the second fifteen minute cycle, a second signal may be transmitted.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In this way, different cough rates may be configured to cause a transmission of different signals. The signals may be preset signals which may, in turn, each trigger different actions at by server <b>410</b> or a mobile computing device in operative communication with device <b>405</b>. Moreover, because signal transmission may substantially impact battery drainage, a power management configuration may cause the transmission circuitry of the detection device to turn on in periodic short bursts as needed.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">If in stage <b>530</b> it is determined that cough counter has not exceeded the threshold, then detection device may proceed to stage <b>540</b>, reset the timer and cough counter, and enter into the passive detection state. When the device enters back into the passive state, an âall clearâ signal may be transmitted. Additional information, such as a low batter warning, may be transmitted when necessary.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 5B</figref> is a flow chart setting forth the general stages involved in a method <b>550</b> consistent with an embodiment of the disclosure for performing cough detection. <figref>FIGS. 6-9</figref> further detail the signal processing and communications aspects disclosed by method <b>550</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">Although method <b>550</b> has been described to be performed in environment <b>400</b> in conjunction with at least one of detection device <b>405</b> and server <b>410</b>, it should be understood that, in some embodiments, different operations may be performed by different environment elements. For example, server <b>410</b> (as further detailed with respect to computing device <b>1000</b>) may be employed in the performance of some or all of the stages in method <b>550</b>. It should be understood that either detection device <b>405</b> or server <b>410</b> may be employed in the performance of some or all of the stages in method <b>550</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Although the stages illustrated by the flow charts are disclosed in a particular order, it should be understood that the order is disclosed for illustrative purposes only. Stages may be combined, separated, reordered, and various intermediary stages may exist. Accordingly, it should be understood that the various stages illustrated within the flow chart may be, in various embodiments, performed in arrangements that differ from the ones illustrated. Moreover, various stages may be added or removed from the flow charts without altering or deterring from the fundamental scope of the depicted methods and systems disclosed herein. Ways to implement the stages of method @<b>00</b> will be described in greater detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">Method <b>550</b> may begin at starting block <b>555</b> and proceed to stage <b>560</b> where a detected sound may be pre-screened for a cough. Screening may be performed to detect a cough-like characteristic of individual detected sounds. For example, using sound energy over time (as further detailed in the figures below), a cough may be detected. By way of non-limiting example, detecting energy over a long duration of time may be a cough, whereas a door slam may be a detected energy over a short period of time).</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">From stage <b>560</b>, method <b>550</b> may advance to stage <b>565</b> where the pre-screened detected cough is further analyzed. Further analysis may comprise, for example, a comparison of the sound waveform profile (e.g., shape and duration compared against a pre-set baseline waveform known to be a cough) associated with the detected cough, along with an analysis of appropriate detailed waveform characteristics in low, middle and high frequency sound ranges and waveform shape (beginning, middle, and end).</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">Various embodiments of the present disclosure may use the large energy in the low frequency 20-320 Hz range to profile productive cough versus unproductive cough (in COPD, unproductive cough may be correlated with a patient's background chronic cough). Accordingly, embodiments may also be configured to determine background chronic cough baseline much more simply by counting the patient cough frequency in between the 25 cough/hour episodes).</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">Method <b>550</b> may continue to stage <b>570</b> where the detected sound may be profiled as a cough sound for disease appropriateness to score the cough episode for sending the appropriate alert. By way of non-limiting example, the following factors may be considered in profiling a cough to issue an alert: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>Cough frequency: asthma may be 50 coughs per hour, COPD may be 25 coughs per hour, and CF may be 110 coughs per hour, and</li><li>Duration of increased cough frequency (e.g., asthma is 10 minutes or more, respiratory infection is 2 minutes or less), and</li><li>Overall waveform characteristic (e.g., asthma cough waveform may be a two-humped camel with a long tail; pneumonia cough waveform may be a one-humped camel with a short tail, TB may be a three humped camel with a short tail and the middle hump may be a spiked waveform representing the TB cough cackle, etc.)</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0077">Embodiments may perform this overall waveform analysis from the analysis in stage <b>565</b> and from comparing the waveform shape to a library of well characterized cough waveforms.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0078">Furthermore, in some embodiments, an additional analysis of the detected sound may be performed in order to individualize the detection since the overall energy of the cough as well as the frequency range (overall lower or higher frequency of cough waveform) can be used to associate a cough sound to an individual. This may be appropriate for determining the cough is from one person versus another where two people coughing are near each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0079">Method <b>550</b> may proceed to stage <b>575</b> where the cough frequency profile may be finalized as an insult that may lead to an alert triggering event (e.g., an asthma attack, respiratory infection, or a baseline unproductive coughing). Method <b>550</b> may then end at stage <b>580</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0080">IV. Signal Processing</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0081">The creation and manufacture of a low cost wearable device to detect human coughing provides challenges in as much as the human cough is not closely modeled by a sonic impulse but rather a time extended âchirpâ of complex frequencies that can last for approximately 200 ms to 400 ms. <figref>FIGS. 6-8</figref> illustrate charts corresponding cough detection algorithms that may be used with embodiments of the present disclosure. Embodiments of the present disclosure may employ, for example, two or more microphones embedded within detection device <b>405</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0082">The signal illustrated in <figref>FIG. 6A</figref> represents a subject who made a distinct effort to cough five times over a period of approximately five seconds. Even though the subject attempted to make the five coughs as distinct as possible, a natural âbounceâ occurred in the subject's chest cavity that caused secondary trailing sounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0083">The signal in <figref>FIG. 6A</figref> comprises five major âchirpsâ (or regions) corresponding to five detected coughs. The first region comprises a set of two or three distinct sounds, while the second and forth coughs are followed by noise representing the subject's chest bounce. Each person may have his/her own specific sequence of cough/transient waveforms that may vary with, for example, a type, severity and location of lung distress.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0084">
        <figref>FIG. 6B</figref> illustrates a first filter that may be applied to the sound to better distinguish coughs from noise (e.g. the subsequent chest bouncing after the cough). The horizontal lines added represent âthresholdâ references (e.g. amplitude threshold slicing points) that correspond to a y-axis band-pass type filter for the amplitude of the waveform.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0085">As can be understood form <figref>FIG. 6B</figref>, the threshold slicing points would render different cough counts depending upon their position on the waveform. For example, an overly low threshold may allow ambient noise to pass through the filter and render the cough counting less effective. On the other hand, an overly high threshold may miss coughs and, consequently, give false counts.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0086">A cough detection device consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure may employ this filter type in cough detection. Threshold slicing may be calibrated, employ additional algorithms, and vary from embodiment to embodiment of the present disclosure. Nevertheless, no matter what threshold values may be set for this filter, there may be an error as large as 50% for time domain detection methods (TDDM). Accordingly, embodiments of the present disclosure that employ this filter type may trigger (i.e. provide a warning notification) on a âlooseâ cough count target over an extended period of time.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0087">Various embodiments of the present disclosure may also employ frequency based methods of cough detection and counting. <figref>FIG. 7A</figref> illustrates the signal of a subject's five cough cycle. The signal may be captured by an AC coupled (DC removed) microphone and amplified by methods available to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0088">Using a 0V threshold, the signal may be split into positive and negative going voltages as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 7B</figref>. The upper and lower signal portions may be vary slightly, so both portions should be used in the detection. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 7C</figref>, the upper voltage may be preserved as V<sub>after</sub>+=V<sub>before</sub>+, while the lower waveform may be inverted as V<sub>after</sub>â=â(V<sub>before</sub>â).</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0089">This signal portions of <figref>FIG. 7C</figref> may then be passed to an Operational Amplifier to subtract the two portions, yielding V<sub>result</sub>=V<sub>after</sub>+âV<sub>after</sub>â. V<sub>result</sub>, depicted in <figref>FIG. 7D</figref>, may represent the absolute value of the signal illustrated in <figref>FIG. 7A</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0090">The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the final waveform in <figref>FIG. 7D</figref> may be improved for better cough detection. For example, applying a straight threshold with a rising edge trigger for counting coughs like the one shown in <figref>FIG. 8A</figref>, seven coughs may be detected. This may result in an error of 40% since the subject only coughed five times. Knowing that distinct coughs may not occur in intervals of less than, for example, 300 ms, the detection error may be improved. Consistent with various embodiments of the present disclosure, a disable circuit may be activated upon each rising edge trigger. The disable circuit would effectively prevent or hold the rising edge trigger from activating for at least a predetermined interval of, for example, 300 ms. In this way, the cough count may be incremented by rising edge triggers is not activated for the noise occurring in between the actual coughs. <figref>FIG. 8B</figref> shows the rising edge trigger counting methods coupled with a disabling circuit at approximately 300 ms intervals. As a result, the rising edge trigger method may now count five coughs.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0091">Embodiments of the present disclosure may further improve cough detection by personalizing the detection device to the individual cough print or waveform of the user. For example, in addition to having stored a small library of recorded coughs associated with different gender, ages, and types of coughs, a cloud-based server may be configured to receive, from the detection device, a cough of the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0092">Consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure, when the detection device is initialized, a user may record a cough to the device. The device may then be configured to communicate this recorded cough to an external device, such as a smartphone app or a cloud-based server (e.g., server <b>410</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0093">The external device, such as the cloud-based server, may then process the received recording and derive a baseline dataset to be used as a comparison point by the detection device. The baseline dataset may comprise, for example, a baseline waveform and/or other data to which a signal may be compared and analyzed for cough detection. In turn, the external device may communicate the baseline waveform back to the detection device. The detection device may, in turn, update its processing algorithms for cough detection based on the updated baseline dataset. In this way, if the user were to lose his detection device or otherwise replace his detection device, the algorithm update may be applied to easily personalize the detection device to the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0094">Moreover, as the cough-detection algorithm improves, the software may be continuously upgraded by connection to the external device. The cough-detection algorithm may improve with use of the detection device, as it may learn and build a user-specific cough profile. In accordance to the embodiments of the present disclosure, the connection may not be limited to a wireless connection. For instance, the connection may be a wired, Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0095">V. Detection Device Architecture</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0096">By way of non-limiting example, <figref>FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> illustrate an architecture for two embodiments of the detection device. The first embodiment may be operated by a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip while the second embodiment may be operated with a uProc approach. It should be understood that other architectures are possible (e.g., system on chip (SOC)). The hardware components may be operative to perform the detection, analysis and processing disclosed in the various embodiments of the present disclosure (e.g., method <b>500</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0097">Consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure, an AC small amplitude response may be received by a microphone integrated in the detection device. In some embodiments, two or more microphones may be used (e.g., one on each side of the detection device). Using a weak microphone pendent resting on a user's chest cavity, rather than the sensitive microphone, may facilitate the filtering of non-cough related sounds as distant sounds may not be detected by a weak microphone.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0098">The signal from the microphone may then be passed to a differential amplifier for a single ended output to an analog/digital (A/D) converter. The A/D converter may output a <b>16</b> bit word as clocked by clock generation circuitry coupled to the converter.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0099">The clock generation circuitry may produce a clock sample rate (Fs) of 44.1 KHz, corresponding to the Nyquist frequency of the human voice. Accordingly, this Fs may eliminate aliasing of the human voice. Lower sampling rates may be used for cough detection. The clock generation circuitry may also clock the FPGA, uProc, or any other programmable microprocessor with onboard memory (hereinafter âprocessing unitâ) that may be designed with the detection device.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0100">The processing unit may have programmed, in its associated memory storage, computer readable code operative to perform methods of <figref>FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. For instance, the N-Triggers associated with the processing unit may produce HIGH true signals whenever a given threshold of coughs over a period time is exceeded. The N-Triggers may form a parallel input âORâ which produces an enabling signal that may be passed to the transmitter and modulator.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0101">The enabling signal may enable the transmitter and modulator to power up. The serial stream received from the processing unit may be modulated by the modulator and then broadcast over the transmitter. The serial stream may convey source, destination, and detection information to the modulator and, in turn, the transmitter.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0102">After transmission, the detection device may power down the transmitter and the modulator and reinitialize itself. Generally, consistent with embodiments of the disclosure, the detection device may comprise program modules that may include routines, programs, components, data structures, and other types of structures that may perform particular tasks or that may implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, embodiments of the disclosure may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. Embodiments of the disclosure may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0103">Embodiments of the disclosure may also be practiced using other technologies capable of performing logical operations such as, for example, AND, OR, and NOT, including but not limited to mechanical, optical, fluidic, and quantum technologies.

Embodiments of the disclosure, for example, may be implemented as a computer process (method), a computing system, or as an article of manufacture, such as a computer program product or computer readable media.</p>

      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0122">VII. Advantages</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0123">Embodiments of the present disclosure could assist physicians in diagnosing various diseases and disorders. For example, the cough detection analysis could aid a physician in diagnosing pulmonary conditions such as, for example, but not limited to: asthma (which is still a remarkably difficult condition to diagnose objectively both in children and adults), COPD and mixed asthma/COPD, GERD, lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, interstitial fibrosis, alveolitis.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0124">Furthermore, embodiments of the present disclosure may be configured to combine cough data, GPS data, weather and pollen data (from various third party databases) in order to trace hotspots that are causing allergies. Using this aggregated data, embodiments of the disclosure may be enabled to predict the potential for future incidents based on our proprietary map of hotspots and, for example, but not limited to, current weather (e.g., wind direction and the like) at a given location. In this way, detected cough data (indicating, for example, asthma incidents).</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0125">Furthermore, embodiments of the present disclosure could assist physicians in assessing exacerbations of conditions already diagnosed such as asthma COPD and cystic fibrosis in terms of severity and cause, especially to try to distinguish whether or not microbial infection is paramount. Being able to differentiate an exacerbation of COPD caused by infection from other causes would be a significant breakthrough in objective diagnosis and could have a major impact on use of resources such as antibiotics and hospitalization, COPD being considered the third biggest fatal disease category worldwide.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0126">Further still, embodiments of the present disclosure could assist physicians in distinguishing types of infection. Pneumonia, TB, whooping cough, which are emerging again as a significant cause of chronic cough may be difficult to diagnose from conventional the microbiological and serum testing methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0127">Embodiments of the present disclosure may assist a physician in treating patients with cardiac based disease by, for example, facilitating the detection of coughing sounds associated with left ventricular failure or right ventricular failure and detecting rate disturbance such as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0128">VIII. Claims</p>
