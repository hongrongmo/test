    <heading id="h-00001-en">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This invention relates to water-soluble polymer conjugates of biologically active molecules, and in particular, to water-soluble polymer conjugates of opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, and related pharmaceutical compositions and uses thereof.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Natural and synthetic alkaloids of opium (i.e., opioids) are useful as analgesics for the treatment of severe pain. Opioids target three types of endogenous opioid receptors: Âµ-, Î´-, and Îº-receptors. Many opioids, such as morphine, are Âµ-receptor agonists that are highly efficacious analgesic compounds due to their activation of opioid receptors in the brain and central nervous system (CNS). Opioid receptors are, however, not only limited to the CNS, but may be found in other tissues throughout the body. These receptors located outside the CNS are referred to as peripheral receptors. A number of side effects associated with opioid use are caused by activation of these peripheral receptors. For example, administration of opioid agonists often results in intestinal dysfunction due to action of the opioid agonist upon the large number of receptors in the intestinal wall. Specifically, opioids are generally known to cause nausea and vomiting as well as inhibition of normal propulsive gastrointestinal function in animals, resulting in side effects such as constipation.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Opioid-induced side effects are a serious problem for patients being administered opioid analgesics for both short term and long term pain management. For instance, more than 250,000 terminal cancer patients each year take opioids, such as morphine, for pain relief, and about half of those patients experience severe constipation. In many situations the discomfort can be so great that the patients choose to forego the pain relief in order to avoid the constipation. In an effort to address this problem, certain opioid antagonist compounds that do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier have been tested for use in curbing opioid-induced side effects. For instance, the peripheral Âµ-opioid antagonist compound, methylnaltrexone, and related compounds have been suggested for use in assuaging opioid-induced side effects. See for example, <patcit id="pcit-00001" dnum="US5972954A"><text>U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,972,954</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit-00002" dnum="US5102887A"><text>5,102,887</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit-00003" dnum="US4861781A"><text>4,861,781</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit-00004" dnum="US4719215A"><text>4,719,215</text></patcit>, which describe the use of methylnaltrexone and related compounds in controlling opioid-induced pruritus, nausea, and/or vomiting. Methylnaltrexone, however, is an experimental drug and is not commercially available. Unfortunately, most of the currently available opioid antagonists, such as the tertiary opioid antagonist, naloxone, are small molecules that not only possess antagonist activity at peripheral receptors associated with the intestine, but also possess antagonist activity at CNS receptors since they cross the blood-brain barrier. Consequently, many opioid antagonists interfere with the pain relief brought about by administration of opioid-based analgesics. Thus, at present, patients receiving opioid pain medications face the difficult choice of suffering burdensome adverse effects such as constipation or ineffective analgesia.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Thus, there is a need in the art for alternative compounds, or for approaches for modifying or improving upon existing compounds, that can reduce or eliminate opioid-induced side effects such as constipation, even when administered in high doses, without interfering with the pain-suppressing effects of the opioid.</p>
    <heading id="h-00003-en">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The present invention is based upon the development of water-soluble, polymer-modified opioid antagonist compounds designed for the treatment of opioid-induced side effects such as constipation, while not reversing or impacting analgesia.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In one aspect, the present invention provides a polymer conjugate comprising a water-soluble and non-peptidic polymer covalently attached to an opioid antagonist.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Suitable polymers for covalent attachment to an opioid antagonist include poly(alkylene glycols), poly(oxyethylated polyol), poly(olefinic alcohol), poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylamide), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylate), poly(saccharides), poly(Î±-hydroxy acid), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyphosphazene, polyoxazoline, poly(N-acryloylmorpholine), poly(acrylic acid), carboxymethyl cellulose, hyaluronic acid, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, and copolymers, terpolymers, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment of the invention, the polymer is a polyethylene glycol. In an alternative embodiment, the polymer is polyacrylic acid.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The polymer portion of a conjugate of the invention may be linear, such as methoxy PEG, branched, or forked. In particular embodiments of the invention wherein the polymer is linear, the conjugate may incorporate a heterobifunctional or a homobifunctional polymer. A conjugate of a heterobifunctional polymer is one wherein one terminus of the polymer attached to the opioid antagonist and the other terminus is functionalized with a different moiety. A conjugate of a homobifunctional polymer possesses a structure wherein each end of a linear polymer is covalently attached to an opioid antagonist, typically by an identical linkage.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Exemplary opioid antagonists include buprenorphine, cyclazocine, cyclorphan, naloxone, N-methylnaloxone, naltrexone, N-methylnaltrexone, nalmephene, 6-amino-6-desoxo-naloxone, levallorphan, nalbuphine, naltrendol, naltrindole, nalorphine, nor-binaltorphimine, oxilorphan, pentazocine, piperidine-N-alkylcarboxylate opioid antagonists, and opioid antagonist polypeptides. One particularly preferred opioid antagonist is naloxone or a derivative thereof, such as 6-amino-6-desoxo-naloxone.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In yet another embodiment, the polymer conjugate is covalently attached to the opioid antagonist by a hydrolytically stable linkage. Hydrolytically stable linkages include amide, amine, carbamate, ether, thioether, and urea-based linkages.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In one embodiment of the invention, the molecular weight of the polymer is less than about 5,000 daltons (Da).</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In yet another embodiment, the molecular weight of the polymer is less than about 2,000 Da.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In yet an even more preferred embodiment, the molecular weight of the polymer is less than about 1,000 Da.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In yet another embodiment, the molecular weight of the polymer is less than about 800 Da.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In another aspect, the invention encompasses a pharmaceutical composition containing a polymer conjugate as described above in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">According to yet another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating at least one side effect of opioid administration, particularly side effects associated with the gastrointestinal system (e.g., nausea and constipation) by administering a conjugate of a water-soluble and non-peptidic polymer covalently attached to an opioid antagonist.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In one embodiment of the method, the conjugate is preferably administered conjointly with an opioid agonist, meaning the conjugate is administered at the same time as the opioid agonist or within a short period of time before or after administration of the opioid agonist. In yet a further embodiment of the method, the conjugate is administered orally.</p>
    <heading id="h-00004-en">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.</p>
    <heading id="h-00005-en">
      <u>I. Definitions</u>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The following terms as used herein have the meanings indicated.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">As used in the specification, and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an", "the", include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The terms "functional group", "active moiety", "reactive site", "chemically reactive group" and " chemically reactive moiety" are used in the art and herein to refer to distinct, definable portions or units of a molecule. The terms are somewhat synonymous in the chemical arts and are used herein to indicate the portions of molecules that perform some function or activity and are reactive with other molecules. The term "active," when used in conjunction with a functional group, is intended to include those functional groups that react readily with electrophilic or nucleophilic groups on other molecules, in contrast to those groups that require strong catalysts or highly impractical reaction conditions in order to react (i.e., "non-reactive" or "inert" groups). For example, as would be understood in the art, the term "active ester" would include those esters that react readily with nucleophilic groups such as amines. Exemplary active esters include N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters or 1-benzotriazolyl esters. Typically, an active ester will react with an amine in aqueous medium in a matter of minutes, whereas certain esters, such as methyl or ethyl esters, require a strong catalyst in order to react with a nucleophilic group. As used herein, the term "functional group" includes protected functional groups.</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The term "protected functional group" or "protecting group" or "protective group" refers to the presence of a moiety (i.e., the protecting group) that prevents or blocks reaction of a particular chemically reactive functional group in a molecule under certain reaction conditions. The protecting group will vary depending upon the type of chemically reactive group being protected as well as the reaction conditions to be employed and the presence of additional reactive or protecting groups in the molecule, if any. Protecting groups known in the art can be found in <nplcit id="ncit-00001" npl-type="b"><text>Greene, T.W., et al., PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS, 3rd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, NY (1999</text></nplcit>).</p>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The term "linkage" or "linker" (L) is used herein to refer to an atom or a collection of atoms used to link, preferably by one or more covalent bonds, interconnecting moieties such as two polymer segments or a terminus of a polymer and a reactive functional group present on a bioactive agent, such as an opioid antagonist. A linker of the invention may be hydrolytically stable or may include a physiologically hydrolyzable or enzymatically degradable linkage.</p>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">A "physiologically hydrolyzable" or "hydrolytically degradable" bond is a weak bond that reacts with water (i.e., is hydrolyzed) under physiological conditions. Preferred are bonds that have a hydrolysis half life at pH 8, 25 Â°C of less than about 30 minutes. The tendency of a bond to hydrolyze in water will depend not only on the general type of linkage connecting two central atoms but also on the substituents attached to these central atoms. Appropriate hydrolytically unstable or degradable linkages include but are not limited to carboxylate ester, phosphate ester, anhydrides, acetals, ketals, acyloxyalkyl ether, imines, orthoesters, peptides and oligonucleotides.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">A "hydrolytically stable" linkage or bond refers to a chemical bond, typically a covalent bond, that is substantially stable in water, that is to say, does not undergo hydrolysis under physiological conditions to any appreciable extent over an extended period of time. Examples of hydrolytically stable linkages include but are not limited to the following: carbon-carbon bonds (e.g., in aliphatic chains), ethers, amides, urethanes, and the like. Generally, a hydrolytically stable linkage is one that exhibits a rate of hydrolysis of less than about 1-2% per day under physiological conditions. Hydrolysis rates of representative chemical bonds can be found in most standard chemistry textbooks.</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">An "enzymatically unstable" or degradable linkage is a linkage that can be degraded by one or more enzymes.</p>

      <u>II. Polymer Conjugates of Opioid Antagonists</u>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">As described generally above, the polymer conjugates of the invention comprise a water-soluble and non-peptidic polymer covalently attached to an opioid antagonist. The polymer conjugates of the invention are useful for the treatment of one or more side effects of opioid analgesic administration, such as nausea, pruritus or constipation. The conjugates of the invention typically comprise a polymer having a molecular weight selected such that the conjugate either i) does not pass to any appreciable extent through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream, so as to increase the localized concentration of polymer conjugate in the intestine and promote binding to opioid receptors in the intestinal wall, and/or ii) does not pass through the blood-brain barrier and into the CNS. According to one feature of the invention, upon administration, the polymer conjugate is retained within the gastrointestinal system and acts directly in the gut, or at least outside of the CNS, to reduce the likelihood of the opioid antagonist interfering with the analgesic effects of the opioid compound. In this manner, the polymer conjugates of the invention are capable of treating the common side effects of opioid use by selectively reacting with peripheral receptors without adversely impacting the analgesic effect of the opioid.</p>
    <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">So, in essence, covalent attachment of the polymer to the opioid antagonist can increase the resistance of the conjugate to both intestinal barrier transport (e.g., into the circulation) and blood-brain barrier transport as compared to the unmodified opioid antagonist, thereby (i) preventing the opioid antagonist from interfering with the pain relief provide by the opioid and (ii) improving the effectiveness of the unmodified opioid antagonist.</p>
    <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">For the most effective treatment of opioid-induced constipation stemming from interaction of the opioid with opioid receptors within the intestinal wall, it is preferable to select a polymer molecular weight that prevents or at least significantly reduces penetration of the polymer conjugate through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream. Preferably, the molecular weight of the polymer is selected so as not to impede penetration of the polymer conjugate into the mucosal membrane of the intestinal barrier. As would be understood, the mucosal membrane is the primary intestinal barrier to potentially harmful antigens and bacteria and comprises epithelial cells that secrete, and are coated with, a layer of mucus about 2mm thick, which adheres tightly to the cell membranes. The mucus lubricates the epithelial cell surfaces and prevents mechanical damage by the stomach contents. Although not bound by any particular theory, penetration into the mucosal membrane is believed to promote interaction between the polymer conjugate of the invention and the peripheral opioid receptors in the intestinal wall. Thus, the conjugates of the invention are preferably designed to achieve a balance of factors, such as (i) maintaining the antagonist activity of the opioid antagonist, (ii) penetrating the mucosal barrier of the intestine while not crossing to a significant extent from the intestine into the bloodstream, and (iii) if present in the general circulation, exhibiting the inability to cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant degree.</p>
    <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Typically, the number average molecular weight of the polymer portion of a polymer conjugate of the invention is less than about 5,000 daltons (Da), and more preferably is less than about 2,000 Da. In an even more preferred embodiment of the invention, the polymer possesses a molecular weight of about 1,000 Da or less, or of about 800 Da or less. In turning now to ranges of molecular weights for the polymer portion of the conjugate, the molecular weight range is generally from about 100 Da to about 2,000 Da, preferably about 100 Da to about 1,000 Da, more preferably about 100 Da to about 800 Da, or from about 100 Da to about 500 Da. Polymer backbones having a number average molecular weight of about 100 Da, about 200 Da, about 300 Da, about 400 Da, about 500 Da, about 550 Da, about 600 Da, about 700 Da, about 800 Da, about 900 Da and about 1,000 Da are particularly preferred. The polymers of the invention are hydrophilic in nature, thereby imparting hydrophilicity to the resulting conjugates and making them unable to cross the blood-brain barrier to a significant extent.</p>
    <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">To reduce the possibility of deactivation of the antagonist activity of the opioid antagonist compound and to keep the total molecular weight of the polymer backbone portion of the conjugate within the preferred range, it is sometimes preferable to only attach a single polymer backbone to the opioid antagonist molecule, or, if employing a branched polymer, to utilize a polymer at the lower end of the preferred molecular weight ranges described above. Alternatively, a linear or forked polymer having two opioid antagonist molecules attached may be used to achieve the desired balance of activity and penetration characteristics.</p>
    <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The linkage between the polymer backbone and the opioid antagonist is preferably hydrolytically stable so that the opioid antagonist is not released from the polymer following administration to a patient. Release of the opioid antagonist <i>in vivo</i> could lead to a loss in analgesic effect of the opioid compound due to passage of the released opioid antagonist into the CNS. Representative linkages for connecting the opioid antagonist and the polymer include ether, amide, urethane (also known as carbamate), amine, thioether (also known as sulfide), and urea (also known as carbamide) linkages. The particular linkage and linkage chemistry employed will depend upon the subject opioid antagonist, functional groups within the molecule available either for attachment to a polymer or conversion to a suitable attachment site, the presence of additional functional groups within the molecule, and the like, and can be readily determined by one skilled in the art based upon the guidance presented herein.</p>
    <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The polymer conjugates of the invention maintain at least a measurable degree of specific opioid antagonist activity. That is to say, a polymer conjugate in accordance with the invention will possesses anywhere from about 1% to about 100% or more of the specific activity of the unmodified parent opioid antagonist compound. Such activity may be determined using a suitable <i>in-vivo</i> or <i>in-vitro</i> model, depending upon the known activity of the particular opioid antagonist parent compound. For example, a hot plate or tail flick analgesia assay can be used to assess the level of antagonist activity of the polymer conjugates of the invention (See, for example, <nplcit id="ncit-00002" npl-type="s"><text>Tulunay, et al., JPharmacol Exp Ther 1974;190:395-400</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit-00003" npl-type="s"><text>Takahashi, et al., Gen Pharmacol 1987;18(2):201-3</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit-00004" npl-type="s"><text>Fishman, et al., Pharmacology 1975;13(6):513-9</text></nplcit>). In general, a polymer conjugate of the invention will possess a specific activity of at least about 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 80%, 90% or more relative to that of the unmodified parent opioid antagonist, when measured in a suitable model, such as those well known in the art. Preferably, a conjugate of the invention will maintain at least 50% or more of the opioid antagonist activity of the unmodified parent compound.</p>
    <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">In addition to maintaining at least a portion of the opioid antagonist activity of the parent opioid antagonist compound, the polymer conjugates of the invention also exhibit high levels of activity with respect to peripheral opioid receptors in gastrointestinal tissue, while exhibiting substantially no activity with respect to opioid receptors in the CNS. The term "substantially no CNS activity", as used herein, means the polymer conjugates of the invention cause less than about a 25% reduction in the analgesic effect of the opioid agonist, which can be measured, for example, using a tail flick or hot plate analgesia assay as described above. In preferred embodiments, the polymer conjugates of the invention cause less than about 20% reduction in the analgesic effect of the opioid agonist, more preferably less than about 15% reduction, or even less than about 10% or less than about 5% reduction. A reduction of analgesic effect of about 0% (i.e., no reduction in analgesia) is most preferred.</p>

When referring to a polymer conjugate, it is to be understood that the polymer can be any of a number of water soluble and non-peptidic polymers, such as those described herein as suitable for use in the present invention. Preferably, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is the polymer backbone. The term PEG includes poly(ethylene glycol) in any of a number of geometries or forms, including linear forms (e.g., alkoxy PEG or bifunctional PEG), branched or multi-arm forms (e.g., forked PEG or PEG attached to a polyol core), pendant PEG, or less preferably, PEG with degradable linkages therein, to be more fully described below.</p>

      <u>B. Linkage Between Polymer Backbone and Opioid Antagonist</u>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The linkage between the opioid antagonist and the polymer backbone (i.e., X in Formula I) results from the reaction of a reactive functional group of the polymer with a functional group on the opioid antagonist molecule. The specific linkage will depend on the structure of the functional groups utilized, and will typically be governed by the functional groups contained in the opioid antagonist molecule. For example, an amide linkage can be formed by reaction of a polymer having a terminal carboxylic acid group, or an active ester thereof, with an opioid antagonist having an amine group. Alternatively, a sulfide linkage can be formed by reaction of a polymer terminated with a thiol group with an opioid antagonist bearing a hydroxyl group. In another embodiment, an amine linkage is formed by reaction of an amino-terminated polymer with an opioid antagonist bearing a hydroxyl group. The particular coupling chemistry employed will depend upon the structure of the opioid antagonist, the potential presence of multiple functional groups within the opioid antagonist, the need for protection/deprotection steps, chemical stability of the molecule, and the like, and will be readily determined by one skilled in the art. Illustrative linking chemistry useful for preparing the polymer conjugates of the invention can be found, for example, in <nplcit id="ncit-00006" npl-type="b"><text>Wong, S.H., (1991), "Chemistry of Protein Conjugation and Crosslinking", CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL</text></nplcit> and in <nplcit id="ncit-00007" npl-type="s"><text>Brinkley, M.

    <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The linkage is preferably hydrolytically stable to prevent release of the opioid antagonist after administration to the patient, thereby reducing the possibility of transport of the antagonist through the intestinal barrier and into the bloodstream. Once in the bloodstream, there is an increased possibility of the antagonist passing through the blood-brain barrier and negatively impacting the analgesic effect of the opioid, depending of course on the particulars of the particular opioid antagonist. Exemplary hydrolytically stable linkages include amide, amine, carbamate, ether, thioether, and urea.</p>
    <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">The overall X linkage is intended to encompass any linkage between the polymer and the opioid antagonist molecule having an overall length of from 1 to about 20 atoms, preferably 1 to about 10 atoms.</p>

    <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">As defined herein, an "opioid antagonist" is any molecule that blocks the action of an opioid agonist at one or more opioid receptor types, including so-called "agonist-antagonist" molecules that act as an antagonist for one opioid receptor type and an agonist for another receptor type (e.g., nalorphine or pentazocine). The opioid antagonist preferably exhibits no agonist activity for any opioid receptor type and preferably exhibits antagonist activity for Âµ-receptors. Many opioid antagonists are structurally similar to the closest agonist analogue, with the exception of a larger hydrocarbon group attached to the N<sub>17</sub> position. For example, nalorphine is structurally identical to morphine with the exception of replacement of the N<sub>17</sub> methyl group of morphine with an allyl group. Suitable opioid antagonists include, but are not limited to, buprenorphine, cyclazocine, cyclorphan, naloxone, N-methylnaloxone, naltrexone, N-methylnaltrexone, nalmephene, 6-amino-6-desoxo-naloxone, levallorphan, nalbuphine, naltrendol, naltrindole, nalorphine, nor-binaltorphimine, oxilorphan, pentazocine, piperidine-N-alkylcarboxylate opioid antagonists such as those described in <patcit id="pcit-00008" dnum="US5159081A"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 5,159,081</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit-00009" dnum="US5250542A"><text>5,250,542</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit-00010" dnum="US5270328A"><text>5,270,328</text></patcit>; and <patcit id="pcit-00011" dnum="US5434171A"><text>5,434,171</text></patcit> (all of which are incorporated by reference herein), opioid antagonist polypeptides (such as those described by <nplcit id="ncit-00008" npl-type="b"><text>R.J.

The polyol may include other protected or unprotected functional groups as well without departing from the invention. Although the spacing between hydroxyl groups will vary from polyol to polyol, there are typically 1 to about 20 atoms, such as carbon atoms, between each hydroxyl group, preferably 1 to about 5. Preferred polyols include glycerol, reducing sugars such as sorbitol, pentaerythritol, and glycerol oligomers, such as hexaglycerol. A 21-arm polymer can be synthesized using hydroxypropyl-Î²-cyclodextrin, which has 21 available hydroxyl groups. The particular polyol chosen will depend on the desired number of hydroxyl groups needed for attachment to the polymer arms.

The method of treatment comprises administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a composition or formulation containing a polymer conjugate of an opioid antagonist as described above. The therapeutically effective dosage amount of any specific conjugate will vary somewhat from conjugate to conjugate, patient to patient, and will depend upon factors such as the condition of the patient, the activity of the particular opioid antagonist employed, and the route of delivery. As would be understood, if a polymer conjugate of an opioid antagonist has reduced antagonist activity as compared to the unconjugated parent molecule, higher doses can be used to offset the reduced activity. As a general proposition, a dosage from about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg body weight, preferably from about 1.0 to about 20 mg/kg, will have therapeutic efficacy. When administered conjointly with other pharmaceutically active agents, even less of the polymer conjugate may be therapeutically effective.</p>
    <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">The polymer conjugate may be administered once or several times a day. The duration of the treatment may be once per day for a period of from two to three weeks and may continue for a period of months or even years. The daily dose can be administered either by a single dose in the form of an individual dosage unit or several smaller dosage units or by multiple administration of subdivided dosages at certain intervals.</p>
    <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">The polymer conjugate can be administered conjointly with the opioid agonist, meaning the polymer conjugate and the opioid agonist are administered at the same time or the opioid agonist and the polymer conjugate are both administered within a short time interval in any order. Preferably, the opioid agonist and the polymer conjugate are administered at the same time or within about an hour apart, more preferably within about 30 minutes apart, even more preferably within about 15 minutes apart (in any order). As would be understood in the art, if the opioid agonist and the polymer conjugate are administered conjointly, the two therapeutic agents can be administered in the same formulation (i.e., in the same dosage unit).</p>
    <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">Oral delivery is the preferred route of administration for both the opioid agonist and the polymer conjugate of the invention. However, both therapeutic agents could be delivered using other routes and different routes of administration could be used for each therapeutic agent. For example, the opioid agonist could be delivered intravenously and the polymer conjugate of the invention could be delivered orally.</p>
    <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">As used herein, an "opioid agonist" is any natural or synthetic alkaloid of opium that activates one or more opioid receptor types, including partial agonists (i.e., compounds exhibiting activity against less than all opioid receptor types) and agonist-antagonists (i.e., compounds exhibiting agonist activity at one receptor type and antagonist activity at another receptor type). The opioid agonist can be a natural alkaloid such as a penanthrene (e.g., morphine) or benzylisoquinoline (e.g., papaverine), a semi-synthetic derivative (e.g., hydromorphone), or any of various classes of synthetic derivatives (e.g., phenylpiperidines, benzmorphans, priopionanilides, and morphinans). Exemplary opioid agonists include alfentanil, bremazocine, buprenorphine, butorphanol, codeine, cyclazocine, dezocine, diacetylmorphine (i.e., heroin), dihydrocodeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, levorphanol, meperidine (pethidine), methadone, morphine, nalbuphine, noscapine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, papaverine, pentazocine, pethidine, phenazocine, propiram, propoxyphene, sufentanil, thebaine and tramadol. Preferably, the opioid agonist is selected from the group consisting of morphine, codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, dihydrocodeine, propoxyphene, fentanyl, and tramadol.</p>

    <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">The following examples are given to illustrate the invention, but should not be considered in limitation of the invention. For example, although mPEG is used in the examples to illustrate the invention, other forms of PEG and similar polymers that are useful in the practice of the invention are encompassed by the invention as discussed above.</p>
    <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">All PEG reagents referred to in the appended examples are available from Shearwater Corporation of Huntsville, AL. All <sup>1</sup>HNMR data was generated by a 300 or 400 MHz NMR spectrometer manufactured by Bruker.</p>
    <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">Examples 1-4 illustrate methods of forming polymer conjugates using mPEG as the polymer backbone and 6-amino-6-desoxo-naloxone as the opioid antagonist. Examples 1 and 3 illustrate the formation of a hydrolytically stable secondary amine linkage between the polymer backbone and the opioid antagonist. Examples 2 and 4 illustrate the formation of a hydrolytically stable amide linkage between the polymer backbone and the opioid antagonist. Note that 6-amino-6-desoxo-naloxone exists as a mixture of two epimers, alpha and beta. Both epimers are believed to be active and, thus, a mixture of the two epimers can be used. However, although not exemplified below, the two epimers can be separated using separation methods known in the art.</p>
