      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This patent application is based on and claims priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. Â§119(a) to Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2014-044102, 2014-061582, and 2014-175817, filed on Mar. 6, 2014, Mar. 25, 2014, and Aug. 29, 2014, in the Japan Patent Office, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to an ink composition, an ink cartridge, an ink jet recording device, and recorded matter.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Inkjet printers have been drastically diffusing because of their advantages such as low acoustic noises and low running costs and printers capable of printing color images on plain paper are introduced into the market actively. However, it is extremely difficult to satisfy all the properties required of images such as color reproducibility, abrasion resistance, durability, light resistance (fastness), drying property, feathering, color bleed, duplex printing, and ink discharging stability. As a result, the ink used is selected based on the prioritized particular application.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In general, the ink for use in inkjet printers is mainly composed of water, with a coloring agent (colorant) and a hydrosoluble solvent such as glycerin to prevent clogging, etc. As the colorant, dyes are widely used for their excellent coloring and stability. However, the light resistance and water resistance of images of dyes are insufficient. Water resistance is improved to some degree by using special recording media for inkjet having an ink absorbing layer, but is not satisfactory when it comes to plain paper.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">To compensate for such defects, ink using a pigment has begun to be used as a colorant. Although pigment ink is successful and superior to dye ink with regard to light resistance, water resistance, etc., the coloring of pigment ink is degraded by coherence of beams of light having different wavelengths and phases produced by multiple reflections of the beams of light within the pigment. For this reason, pigment ink is considered to be inferior to dye ink in general with regard to coloring.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In an attempt to compensate for such degradation of coloring of pigment ink, pigment particulates that are coated with resin are used. According to this method, the fixing property and the gas resistance property of the pigment ink are further improved by a resin, and in addition dispersion is greatly stabilized. However, currently, pigment ink is not still on a par with dye ink with regard to gloss.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In addition, high performance is demanded upon increasing demand in industry. As printing performance is improved, inkjet printers having line heads are proposed. In attempts to improve the performance, a device for quick drying by adding a permeating agent to an ink to permeate water into a recording medium is proposed to speed up drying of the ink attached to a recording medium.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">However, the permeating property of the pigment is also improved in addition to that of water, thereby degrading image density. In addition, discharging stability is not satisfactory so that further improvement is desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Moreover, plain paper involves problems when it is used as a recording medium such that the surface of the plain paper swells by water serving as the solvent of an ink immediately after printing, which causes the difference of elongation ratio between both surfaces of the plain paper wider, resulting in occurrence of curling. This kind of phenomenon is not a problem for printing at low speeds since it is canceled as drying proceeds. However, as the printing speed increases, recording media are transferred before curling is canceled, which naturally results in paper jam. Increasing the content of an organic solvent in an ink suffices for curling. However, the hydhydrophobicity of the ink becomes strong, which makes it difficult to secure storage stability.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In view of the foregoing, ink compositions are demanded that improve coloring, which is an issue for conventional pigment inks, and have excellent storage stability and discharging stability.</p>

      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0033">The present invention is described in detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0034">In the inkjet recording system, to obtain an excellent coloring image, it is thought to be preferable to fix a colorant such as a pigment on the surface of a recording medium, typically paper, and improve the coloring property of the pigment itself.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0035">However, since widely-used plain paper for a plain paper copier (PPC) has a surface containing no material for fixing in the inkjet recording system, ink on the surface permeates inside the paper. For this reason, pigment particles present around the surface are less in number, resulting in no good coloring. Therefore, the thus-obtained image looks dull.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0036">According to the present invention, this problem is solved by a combination of technologies of fixing a pigment on the surface of a recording medium and improvement of the coloring of the pigment itself.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0037">With regard to the former, a pigment is dispersed by a polymer having a diphosphonic acid group, which has a high reactivity with a calcium ion, and the pigment dispersion particles are caused to react with a calcium ion disassociated from calcium carbonate widely present on the entire of the paper when the pigment dispersion pigments land on the paper. Consequently, the pigment particles agglomerate and remain on the surface, so that recording images having excellent coloring property can be produced. A diphosphonic acid group is hydrophilic but becomes hydrophobic at reaction with a multi-valent metal ion such as calcium ion, magnesium ion, and aluminum ion. For this reason, an ink composition using a polymer containing a diphosphonic acid group as a pigment dispersant is used on a recording medium containing a multi-valent metal salt, the pigment dispersant adsorbed to the pigment reacts with a multi-valent metal ion eluted from the recording medium and becomes hydrophobic, resulting in agglomeration of the pigment. As a result, permeation of the pigment into paper is subdued, which leads to excellent coloring.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0038">As the latter case, by decreasing the crystallinity of a pigment having the structure represented by Chemical formula 1a or Chemical formula 1b while maintaining the crystal structure of the pigment in order not to degrade light resistance or gas resistance, coloring on a par with that of a dye is demonstrated, thereby to output a recording image having excellent coloring. A polymer having a diphosphonic acid group is found to have a particularly good compatibility with the pigment represented by Chemical formula 1a or chemical formula 1b in a case of an ink composition containing an organic solvent. That is, the polymer has good affinity with the pigment mentioned above in ink until it contacts the multi-valent metal ion mentioned above. After the ink is discharged onto a recording medium, the polymer smoothly moves from the pigment to the multi-valent metal ion.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0039">This makes it possible to provide an ink composition that demonstrates an image having excellent coloring irrespective of the kind of paper.</p>

Such ink compositions can be manufactured by a microreactor to precipitate dissolved pigment in minute reaction fields in the following manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0044">âreducing the crystallinityâ while maintaining the crystalline structure of a pigment means reducing an n-th (n&gt;1) peak intensity relatively to the first peak intensity in an X-ray diffraction spectrum.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0045">With regard to the pigment represented by Chemical formula 1a, it is required to reduce the peak intensity Y at a diffraction angle 2Î¸ of from 26.5Â° to 27.5Â° against the intensity X of the first peak at a diffraction angle 2Î¸ of from 5.5Â° to 6.0Â°. Coloring property is improved by satisfying the relation: Y/Xâ¦0.800. In addition, the ratio Y/X is preferably 0.000â¦Y/Xâ¦0.600. Moreover, coloring property is improved if no peak is observed at a diffraction angle 2Î¸ of from 28.0Â° to 29.0 Â°.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0046">The âpeakâ in the present disclosure is determined as a peak having a maximum width of 0.5Â° or greater in a graph of smoothed data and a single local maximal value.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0047">To be specific, after smoothing processing to remove noises from X-ray diffraction intensity data, a smoothing filter by a moving-average method is used if the data were digital.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0048">The five sets of data including the calculation target data, two sets of data therebefore, and two sets of data thereafter were averaged to replace the calculation target data with the smoothing filter. If the data are analogue, the smoothing processing is conducted by drawing a smooth curve that passes through the average of the noises.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0049">Thereafter, a straight base line having a length of 0.5Â° or greater in the X axis direction is drawn in such a manner that only one peak is present on the smoothed data in the range sandwiched by both ends of the base line. If a base line satisfying this condition is drawn and a peak is present within a range of 2Î¸ of from 28.0Â° to 29.0Â°, it is determined that there is a peak. In other cases, it is determined that there is no peak.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0050">As for the pigment represented by Chemical formula 1b, it is required to reduce the peak intensity Yâ² at a diffraction angle 2Î¸ of from 11.0Â° to 11.5Â° against the intensity Xâ² of the first peak at a diffraction angle 2Î¸ of from 26.5Â° to 27.5Â°. Coloring property is improved by satisfying the relation: Yâ²/Xâ²â¦0.200. The relation is preferably 0.000&lt;Yâ²/Xâ²&lt;0.140.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0051">A method of reducing crystallinity while maintaining the crystalline structure of such a pigment includes, for example, temporarily dissolving the pigment in an acid or a solvent and charging the thus-obtained solution into a poor solvent for re-crystallization. In such a method, to prevent the crystal of a pigment from growing excessively, the pigment is quickly precipitated in a small reaction field. Incidentally, conventionally a solution of a pigment is dripped to a poor solvent while being stirred. In such a conventional method, the size of a reaction field for precipitation is about 1 cm or greater and the stirring speed is limited, so that large crystals are formed. As a consequence, pigment particles having a reduced crystallinity are not formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0052">However, a microreactor to precipitate dissolved pigments in minute reaction fields was developed recently, which makes it possible to precipitate pigment particles in minute reaction fields at a high speed while suppressing the growth of crystals. In general, a microreactor is a flow-type reaction device to conduct chemical reaction or mixing and precipitation for material production in a micro space having a size about 1 mm or less per side. Specific examples thereof include, but are not limited to, mikroSyn (manufactured by SIBATA SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY LTD.) having minute plumbing of from 50 Î¼m to 500 Î¼m as a reaction field, MiChS System (manufactured by MiChS Co., Ltd.), and ULREA (manufactured by M Technique Co. Ltd.) utilizing a forced ultra thin layer formed of gaps of from 1 Î¼m to 30 Î¼m between two rotatable discs as a reaction field.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0053">In general, the efficiency of chemical reaction depends on the collision frequency between molecules and energy applied to a system. Since the transfer distance of molecules and heat is short in a micro space, increasing the collision frequency of molecules and quick heat transfer are possible, which enables quick mixing, quick precipitation, quick heat exchange, and quick diffusion. Therefore, to form a pigment having a reduced crystallinity while maintaining the crystalline structure of the pigment, the size of the reaction field is preferably 100 Î¼m or less and more preferably 30 Î¼m or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0054">To dissolve a pigment represented by Chemical formula 1a or Chemical formula 1b, it is possible to use an acid or an organic solvent.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0055">A strong acid such as strong sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and nitric acid can be used as the acid. Strong sulfuric acid is particularly desirable in terms of solubility and dissolves the pigment represented by Chemical formula 1a or Chemical formula 1b at a concentration of from 3% by weight to 5% by weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0056">Specific examples of the organic solvent include, but are not limited to, dimethyl sulfoxide, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, N.N-dimethyl formamide, and N,N-dimethyl acetamide. Of these, dimethyl sulfoxide is suitable in particular. However, since the pigment represented by Chemical formula 1a or Chemical formula 1b has a solubility of less than 1% by weight at room temperature and normal pressure, it is preferable to use strong sulfuric acid to dissolve the pigment represented by Chemical formula 1a or Chemical formula 1b. The temperature of a pigment solution can be raised to the temperature as high as the boiling point of the dissolved acid or organic solvent to increase the solubility.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0057">Specific examples of the poor solvent include, but are not limited to, water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or liquid mixtures in which methanol, ethanol, and/or isopropanol is dissolved in water. If simple water or a liquid mixture of water with the alcohol mentioned above is cooled down to â20Â° C. to â50Â° C., the poor solvent may coagulate. Considering that the reaction is fast when the temperature difference between the pigment solution and the solvent is large, it is preferable to use methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol that contains no water because the temperatures can be lowered.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0058">The size and the crystallinity of pigment particles formed using a microreactor depend on the ratio of the flow rate of a pigment solution to the flow rate of a poor solvent. The ratio of the flow rate (mL/minute) of the pigment solution to the flow rate (mL/minute) of the poor solvent is preferably from 0.005 to 0.5 and more preferably from 0.01 to 0.1. When the ratio is small, the reaction speed is high, meaning that the crystallinity of the pigment can be lowered. When the ratio is 0.5 or less, pigment particles having low cyrstallinity can be formed. By contrast, when the ratio is 0.005 or greater, removing a solvent from pigment particles and thereafter collecting the pigment particles becomes easy.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0059">Pigment particles that are dispersed in a liquid mixture of an acid and a poor solvent formed by a microreactor according to the methods described above are retrieved as a pigment paste after removing the acid and the solvent using a centrifugal followed by washing with deionized water several times.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0060">The pigment dispersed in the ink composition of the present disclosure preferably has a particle diameter of from 30 nm to 100 nm and more preferably from 60 nm to 120 nm To control the pigment particle diameter to be within this range, it is possible to use, for example, a mixing and kneading and dispersing machine using balls such as a bead mill or a ball mill, a mixing and kneading and dispersing machine using a shearing force such as a roll mill, or an ultrasonic wave dispersion machine. Of these, an ultrasonic wave dispersion machine is suitable for the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0061">When the pigment particle diameter is 30 nm or greater, the light resistance of the pigment is improved, thereby reducing the change in color. This is advantageous of using a pigment. In addition, when the pigment particle diameter is 100 nm or less, image gloss becomes high. Therefore, it is possible to produce images with good saturation and brightness.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0062">The concentration of the pigment in an ink is preferably from 1% by weight to 15Â° A by weight, more preferably from 2% by weight to 12% by weight, and furthermore preferably from 3% by weight to 9% by weight. When the pigment density is 1% by weight or greater, sufficient coloring power can be obtained and a high saturation and a high image density can be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0063">In addition, when the pigment concentration is 15% by weight or less, an obtained ink composition is stable for a long period of time because the ink is stabilized.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0064">Polymer Having Structure Unit Having Diphosphonic Acid Group</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0065">The ink composition of the present disclosure has a polymer having a structure unit having a diphosphonic acid group.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0066">The polymer can be obtained by addition polymerization or condensation polymerization but a copolymer is particularly preferable. When a copolymer is used, an ink is obtained which has excellent coloring, storage stability, and discharging stability.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0067">The polymer for use in the present disclosure is obtained by reacting a monomer of Chemical formula 2 having a diphosphonic acid group and another optional monomer with a solvent placed in a flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, and a nitrogen gas introducing tube under the presence of a polymerization initiator in nitrogen gas reflux at about 50Â° C. to about 150Â° C. The viscosity of the aqueous solution or a water liquid dispersion of the synthesized polymer is adjusted by changing the molecular weight thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0068">Specifically, monomer concentration during polymerization, the amount of a polymerization initiator, polymerization temperature, and polymerization time are changed.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0069">With regard to the polymerization temperature, a polymer having a low molecular weight is easily obtained by polymerization at high temperatures for a short period of time. By contrast, a polymer having a high molecular weight tends to be obtained by polymerization at low temperatures for a long period of time.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0070">With regard to the amount of a polymerization initiator, if a large amount thereof is used, a polymer having a low molecular weight tends to be obtained. If the amount is small, a polymer having a high molecular weight tends to be obtained. The polymerization initiator has no particular limit and can be any known polymerization initiator.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0071">With regard to the monomer concentration during polymerization reaction, if the concentration is high, a polymer having a low molecular weight tends to be obtained. If the concentration is low, a polymer having a high molecular weight tends to be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0072">There is no specific limit to the weight average molecular weight of the polymer having a diphosphonic acid group. The weight average molecular weight is appropriately selected to a particular application. It is preferably from 3,000 to 60,000, more preferably from 4,000 to 50,000, and furthermore preferably from 5,000 to 30,000. When the weight average molecular weight is within the preferable range, if the polymer is used for an ink composition for inkjet recording, the dispersion stability and discharging stability of the ink composition are improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0073">The weight average molecular weight can be measured by, for example, gel permeation chromatography (GPC).</p>

      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0103">Polyol aryl ethers such as ethylene glycol monophenyl ether and ethylene glycol monobenzyl ether;</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0104">Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds such as 2-pyrolidone, N-methyl-2-pyrolidone, N-hydroxyethyl-2-pyrolidone, 1,3-dimethylimidazoline, Îµ-caprolactam, and Î³-butylolactone;</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0105">Amides such as formamide, N-methyl formamide, N,N-dimethyl formamide, N,N-dimethyl-Î²-methoxy propion amide, and N,N-dimethyl-Î²-buthoxy propion amide;</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0106">Amines such as monoethanol amine, diethanol amine, triethanol amine, monoethyl amine, diethylamine, and triethyl amine; Sulfur-containing compounds such as dimethyl sulfoxide, sulfolane, and thiodiethanol;</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0107">3-ethyl-3-hydroxymethyl oxetane, propylene carbonate, and ethylene carbonate.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0108">Of these hydrosoluble solvents, 3-ethyl-3-hydroxymethyl oxetane, isopropylidene glycerol, N,N-dimethyl-Î²-methoxy propion amide, and N,N-dimethyl-Î²-buthoxy propion amide are particularly preferable. These are excellent to prevent curling of plain paper.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0109">Sugar groups can be also contained as a hydrosoluble solvent in the present disclosure. Specific examples of the sugar groups include, but are not limited to, monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides (including triaccharides and tetrasaccharides), and polysaccharides. Specific examples thereof include, but are not limited to, glucose, mannose, fructose, ribose, xylose, arabinose, galactose, maltose, cellobiose, lactose, saccharose, trehalose, and maltotriose. Polysaccharides represent sugar in a broad sense and are materials that are present widely in nature, for example, Î±-cyclodextrine and cellulose.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0110">Specific examples of derivatives of these sugar groups include, but are not limited to, reducing sugars, oxidized sugars, amino acid, and thio acid for the sugar groups specified above. Sugar alcohols are particularly preferable and specific examples thereof include, but are not limited to, maltitol and sorbit.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0111">The blend ratio of the pigment and the hydrosoluble solvent has a large impact on the discharging stability of ink discharged from a head. If the blending amount of the hydrosoluble agent is small while the content of the solid pigment portion is large, water evaporation around ink meniscus of nozzles tends to be accelerated, resulting in poor discharging performance. The blending ratio of the hydrosoluble solvent is preferably from 10% by weight to 70% by weight and more preferably from 20% by weight to 50% by weight based on the entire of ink. The ink having such a content ratio is extremely good about the test for drying, preservation, and reliability.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0112">Other Materials</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0113">Known additives such as permeating (penetrating) agents, pH regujlators, preservatives and fungicides, corrosion inhibitors, anti-oxidants, ultraviolet absorbents, oxygen absorbents, light stabilizers, and anti-kogation agents can be optionally added to the ink composition of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0114">Permeating Agent</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0115">By adding a permeating agent to an ink, the surface tension is lowered so that the ink filling property of the ink to the nozzles and the discharging stability ameliorate. In addition, since the ink droplets quickly permeate into a recording medium after the ink droplets have landed thereon, feathering and color bleed are reduced. Surfactants and solvents having a penetrating property are used as the permeating agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0116">The surfactants are classified into anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, and ampholytic surfactants by hydrophilic group or fluorine-based surfactants, acetylene-based surfactants, etc. by hydrophobic group.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0117">Specific examples of the anionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetates, dodecyl benzene sulfonates, laurates, and polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfates.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0118">Specific examples of the nonionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, polyols, glycol ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl esters, polyoxy ethylene sorbitan aliphatic esters, polyoxyethylene alkyl phenyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl amines, polyoxyethylene alkyl amides, and acetylene glycol.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0119">Specific examples of the fluorine-based surfactants include, but are not limited to, perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid salts, perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid salts, perfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid esters, adducts of perfluoroalkyl ethylene oxide, perfluoro alkyl betaine, perfluoro alkyl amine oxide, and perfluoro alkyl ether compounds. Of these, the fluorine-containing surfactant (UNIDYNE DSN-403N, manufactured by DAIKIN INDUSTRIES, ltd.) represented by Chemical formula 10 is particularly preferably used.</p>

      </p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0120">Specific examples of the acetylene glycol-based surfactants include, but are not limited to, acetylene glycols such as 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-desine-4,7-diol, 3,6-dimethyl-4-octine-3,6-diol, and 3,5-dimethyl-1-hexine-3-ol {(for example, SURFYNOLÂ® 104, 82, 465, 485, and TG, manufactured by AIR PRODUCTS and CHEMICALS, INC. (US)}. Of these, SURFYNOLÂ® 104, 465, and TG are particularly good to demonstrate good printing quality.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0121">Specific examples of the solvents having a penetrating property include, but are not limited to, polyols having eight or more carbon atoms such as 2-ethyl-1,3-hexane diol, and 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentane diol and glycol ethers.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0122">These surfactants may be used alone or in combination. In the present disclosure, it is preferable to use the permeating agent in an amount of from 0.01% by weight to 5% weight and, more preferable, from 0.03% weight to 2% weight based on the entire ink.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0123">When the amount of the surfactant is 0.01% by weight or greater, dots sufficiently spread after printing, thereby covering the entire of an image with the dots. As a result, image density and saturation are maintained high. When the amount of the surfactant is 5% by weight or less, foaming is subdued so that flow paths in nozzles are not clogged by foams. Consequently, ink droplets are successfully discharged.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0124">pH Regulator</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0125">The pH regulator is added to maintain the ink in the state of alkali, thereby stabilizing the dispersion state and ink discharging. However, when the pH is too high, the head of inkjet and an ink supplying unit tends to be dissolved easily, which results in modification, leakage, bad discharging performance of the ink, etc. It is more desirable to add a pH regulator when the pigment is mixed and kneaded and dispersed in water together with a dispersant than when additives such as a hydrosoluble solvent and a penetrating agent are added after mixing, kneading, and dispersing. This is because the pH regulator may disrupt the dispersion.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0126">The pH regulator is preferable to contain at least one of an alcohol amine, an alkali metal hydroxide, an ammonium hydroxide, a phosphonium hydroxide, and an alkali metal carbonate.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0127">Specific examples of alcohol amines include, but are not limited to, diethanol amine, triethanol amine, and 2-amino-2-ethyl-1,3-propane diol. Specific examples of the alkali metal hydroxides include, but are not limited to, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide. Specific examples of the ammonium hydroxides include, but are not limited to, ammonium hydroxide, quaternary ammonium hydroxide, and quaternary phosphonium hydroxide. Specific examples of the alkali metal carbonates include, but are not limited to, lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, and potassium carbonate.</p>

      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0129">Specific examples of the preservatives and fungicides include, but are not limited to, dehydrosodium acetate, sodium sorbinate, 2-pyridine thiol-1-oxide sodium, sodium benzoate, and pentachlorophenol sodium.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0130">Corrosion Inhibitor</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0131">Specific examples of the corrosion inhibitors include, but are not limited to, acid sulfite, thiosodium sulfate, ammonium thiodiglycolate, diisopropyl ammonium nitrite, pentaerythritol quaternary nitride, and dicyclohexyl ammonium nitrite.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0132">Anti-Oxidant</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0133">Specific examples of the anti-oxidants include, but are not limited to, phenol-based anti-oxidants (including hindered phenol-based anti-oxidants), amino-based anti-oxidants, sulfur-based anti-oxidants, and phosphorous-based anti-oxidants.</p>

      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0135">Specific examples of the ultraviolet absorbents include, but are not limited to, benzophenone-based ultraviolet absorbents, benzotriazole-based ultraviolet absorbents, salicate-based ultraviolet absorbents, cyanoacrylate-based ultraviolet absorbents, and nickel complex salt-based ultraviolet absorbents.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0136">Anti-Kogation Agent</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0137">The ink composition of the present disclosure optionally contains an anti-kogation agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0138">Kogation is a problematic phenomenon occurring to a thermal head that discharges ink (recording liquid) by utilizing a force of foaming of the ink caused by instant heating upon application of an electric current in a heater. That is, the ink composition is modified by heating, which adheres to a heater. If kogation occurs, the heater cannot conduct heating properly. Consequently, the recording fluid discharging weakens, thereby failing to discharge the recording fluid at the worst. Therefore, an anti-kogation agent is added to the recording fluid of the present disclosure to prevent kogation.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0139">Specific examples of the anti-kogation agents include, but are not limited to, polyphosphoric acid, polyamino carboxylic acid, aldonic acid, hydroxy carboxylic acid, polyol phosphoric acid esters, and salts thereof, acids having an amino group and salts thereof, and ammonium salts of acids having a methyl group, a methylene group, and a carboxyl group.</p>

      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0141">Specific examples of water for use in the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, pure water such as deionozed water, ultrafiltrated water, mill-Q water, and distillated water or ultrapure water. The content of water is preferably from 20% by weight to 80% by weight to the total amount of ink.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0142">Inkjet Recording Device</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0143">The ink composition of the present disclosure can be suitably applied to recording systems employing an inkjet recording system such as printers, facsimile machines, photocopiers, multi-functional machines (serving as a printer, a facsimile machine, and a photocopier) for inkjet recording.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0144">The inkjet recording device of the present disclosure includes a container (e.g., ink container) to accommodate the ink composition of the present disclosure and a recording head to discharge the ink composition supplied from the ink container.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0145">Inkjet recording devices, which were used in Examples, are described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0146">An inkjet recording device <b>101</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> has a sheet feeder tray <b>102</b> to accommodate recording media placed therein, a discharging tray <b>103</b> installed in the inkjet recording device <b>101</b>, which stores recording media on which images are recorded (formed), and an ink cartridge inserting unit <b>104</b>. On the upper surface of the ink cartridge installation unit <b>104</b> is arranged an operating portion <b>105</b> including operation keys, a display, etc. The ink cartridge inserting portion <b>104</b> has a front cover <b>115</b> that is openable and closable to detach and attach an ink cartridge <b>200</b>.

      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0147">Inside the inkjet recording device <b>101</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a guide rod <b>131</b> and a stay <b>132</b> serving as guiding members that are laterally bridged from the right side to the left side hold a carriage <b>133</b> slidably movable in the main scanning direction. A main scanning motor moves the carriage <b>133</b> for scanning.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0148">The carriage <b>133</b> has a recording head <b>134</b> having four inkjet recording heads that discharge ink droplets of each color of yellow (Y), cyan (C), magenta (M), and black (Bk) while multiple ink discharging mouths are arranged in the direction crossing the main scanning direction with the ink droplet discharging direction downward.</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0149">As the heads for inkjet recording that form the recording head <b>134</b>, it is possible to use a device having an energy-generating device to discharge ink such as a piezoelectric actuator such as a piezoelectric element, a thermal actuator that utilizes the phase change caused by film boiling of liquid using an electric heat conversion element such as a heat element, a shape-memory alloy actuator that uses the metal phase change due to the temperature change, and an electrostatic actuator that uses an electrostatic force.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0150">The carriage <b>133</b> has sub tanks <b>135</b> for each color to supply each color ink to the recording head <b>134</b>. The ink is supplied and replenished to the sub-tank <b>135</b> from the ink cartridge <b>200</b> of the present disclosure mounted onto the ink cartridge installation unit <b>104</b> via an ink supplying tube.</p>

      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0152">A transfer unit to transfer the sheet <b>142</b> fed from the sheet feeding unit on the lower side of the recording head <b>134</b> includes a transfer belt <b>151</b> to electrostatically adsorb and transfer the sheet <b>142</b>, a counter roller <b>152</b> to transfer the sheet <b>142</b> fed from the sheet feeding unit via a guide <b>145</b> while pinching the sheet <b>142</b> with the transfer belt <b>151</b>, a transfer guide <b>153</b> to make the sheet <b>142</b> track on the transfer belt <b>151</b> by changing the transfer direction of the sheet <b>142</b> being sent substantially vertically upward by substantially 90Â°, a front end pressure roller <b>155</b> biased towards the transfer belt <b>151</b> by a pressing member <b>154</b>, and a charging roller <b>156</b> to charge the surface of the transfer belt <b>151</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0153">The transfer belt <b>151</b> is an endless form belt, stretched between a transfer roller <b>157</b> and a tension roller <b>158</b> and rotatable in the belt transfer direction. This transfer belt <b>151</b> includes, for example, a top layer serving as a sheet adsorption surface made of a resin material such as a copolymer (ETFE) of tetrafluoroethylene and ethylene with no resistance control treatment having a thickness about 40 Î¼m, and a bottom layer (moderate resistance layer, earth layer) made of the same material as the top layer with resistance control treatment with carbon. On the rear side of the transfer belt <b>151</b>, a guiding member <b>161</b> is arranged corresponding to the printing area by the recording head <b>134</b>. A discharging unit to discharge the sheet <b>142</b> on which images are recorded by the recording head <b>134</b> includes a separation claw <b>171</b> to separate the sheet <b>142</b> from the transfer belt <b>151</b>, a discharging roller <b>172</b>, and a discharging roller <b>173</b>. A discharging tray <b>103</b> is arranged below the discharging roller <b>173</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0154">A duplex printing sheet feeding unit <b>181</b> is detachably attached to the rear side of the inkjet recording device <b>101</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0155">The duplex printing sheet feeding unit <b>181</b> takes in and reverses the sheet <b>142</b> that is returned by the reverse rotation of the transfer belt <b>151</b> and feeds it again between the counter roller <b>152</b> and the transfer belt <b>151</b>.

      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0156">In this inkjet recording device <b>101</b>, the sheet <b>142</b> is separated and fed from the sheet feeding unit one by one substantially vertically upward, guided by the guide <b>145</b>, and transferred while being pinched between the transfer belt <b>151</b> and the counter roller <b>152</b>. Furthermore, the front end is guided by the transfer guide <b>153</b> and pressed against the transfer belt <b>151</b> by the front end pressure roller <b>155</b> to change the transfer direction substantially 90 Â°.</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0157">Since the transfer belt <b>151</b> is charged by the charging roller <b>156</b> at this point in time, the sheet <b>142</b> is electrostatically adsorbed to the transfer belt <b>151</b> and transferred. By driving the recording head <b>134</b> according to the image signal while moving the carriage <b>133</b>, ink droplets are discharged to the sheet <b>142</b> not in motion to record an image for an amount corresponding to one line and thereafter the sheet <b>142</b> is transferred in a predetermined amount to conduct recording for the next line. On receiving a signal indicating that the recording has completed or the rear end of the sheet <b>142</b> has reached the image recording area, the recording operation stops and the sheet <b>142</b> is discharged to the discharging tray <b>103</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0158">When the amount of ink remaining in the sub-tank <b>135</b> is approaching to empty, which is detected, a predetermined amount of the ink is replenished to the sub tank <b>135</b> from the ink cartridge <b>200</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0159">In this inkjet recording device, it is possible to dissemble the chassis of the ink cartridge <b>200</b> and replace the ink bag therein when the ink is used up in the ink cartridge <b>200</b>. In addition, the ink cartridge <b>200</b> stably supplies the ink even when the ink cartridge <b>201</b> is placed on its side and installed by front loading. Therefore, even when the upside of the inkjet recording device <b>101</b> is blocked, for example, it is placed in a rack or something is placed on the upper surface of the inkjet recording device <b>101</b>, the ink cartridge <b>200</b> is easily exchanged.</p>

      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0164">Next, the ink cartridge is described in detail with reference to <figref>FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of an ink bag <b>241</b> of the ink cartridge of the present disclosure. <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the ink cartridge <b>200</b> that accommodates the ink bag of <figref>FIG. 3</figref> in a cartridge housing <b>244</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0165">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, after the ink bag <b>241</b> is filled with ink through an ink inlet <b>242</b> and the air remaining in the ink bag <b>241</b> is discharged, the ink inlet <b>242</b> is closed by fusion. When in use, the ink is supplied by piercing the needle attached to the inkjet recording device into an ink outlet <b>243</b> made of rubber. The ink bag <b>241</b> is formed of a packaging material such as aluminum laminate film having no air permeability.

      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0170">Of these, at least one of plain paper and coated paper for printing is preferable. Plain paper is advantageous because it is inexpensive. Moreover, coated paper for printing is relatively inexpensive to gloss paper and advantageous to be able to print a smooth image with gloss. Plain paper and coated paper for printing are not dried well. For this reason, they are not practically suitable for inkjet printing. However, according to the ink composition of the present disclosure, the drying property of the ink composition is improved so that such recording media can be suitably used.</p>

After nitrogen was blown into this solution for 30 minutes, 1.33 parts of azobis isobutylonitrile was added thereto at 65Â° C. to conduct polymerization reaction for 4 hours. A viscous material obtained by removing the solvent from the thus-obtained liquid polymerization using an evaporator was added to acetone to retrieve a solid material. While diluting the thus-obtained solid material (polymer) with water, sodium hydroxide was added followed by three-day dialysis membrane refinement to achieve 100% acid neutralization. Thereafter, the concentration of the resultant was adjusted with water in such a manner that the concentration of the solid portion was 10% by weight.

Co., Ltd.) represented by Chemical formula 1a-2 was dissolved in 970 parts of strong sulfuric acid was caused to flow into the same rotation discs at an flowing amount rate of 30 mL/min to precipitate pigment particles; The thus-obtained pigment liquid dispersion was condensed by a centrifugal and diluted with deionized water repeatedly to adjust the pH of the resultant to be around 6, thereby obtaining a pigment paste having a pigment concentration of 30% by weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0200">Thereafter, 6.0 parts of Polymer a was dissolved in 44.0 parts of deionized water and mixed with 50 parts of the pigment paste prepared as described above. Thereafter, the resultant was subject to one-hour treatment by an ultrasonic homogenizer to obtain Dispersion Element 1A having a pigment concentration of 15% by weight.</p>

      <heading id="h-00101-en" level="2">(1) Measuring of X Ray Diffraction Spectrum</heading>
      <p id="p-00325-en" num="0296">To measure X-ray diffraction spectra of the pigments manufactured in Examples and Comparative Examples, X'Pert Pro (manufactured by PANalytical Co.) was used. Using a Cu enclosure tube (KÎ± characteristic X-ray: wavelength of 1,541 â«) as an X-ray generator, the measuring was conducted under the conditions of a measuring range 20 of from 3.0Â° to 35.0Â°, a sampling width of 0.02Â°, and a cumulative time of 1.0 second. With regard to the X-ray diffraction measuring of the pigments of Examples, pigment powder was prepared for measuring by removing moisture from the pigment pastes prior to dispersion by heating them to 50Â° C. with a reduced pressure. With regard to the X-ray diffraction measuring of the pigments of Comparative Examples, the pigment powder prior to dispersion was used for measuring. <figref>FIGS. 5 to 8</figref> illustrate X-ray diffraction spectra of Example 22A, Example 4B, Comparative Example 1A, and Comparative Example 1B.</p>
      <p id="p-00326-en" num="0297">The peak in the present disclosure is determined as a peak having a maximum width of 0.5Â° or greater in a graph of smoothed data and a single local maximal value.</p>
      <p id="p-00327-en" num="0298">To be specific, after smoothing processing to remove noises from X-ray diffraction intensity data, a smoothing filter according to a moving-average method was used to average five sets of data including the calculation target data, two sets of data therebefore, and two kinds of data thereafter to replace the calculation target data if the data were digital. The smoothing processing was conducted by drawing a smooth curve that passed through the average of the noises if the data were analogue. Thereafter, a straight base line having a length of 0.5Â° or greater in the X axis direction was drawn in such a manner that only one peak was present on the smoothed data in the range sandwiched by both ends of the base line. If a base line satisfying this condition was drawn and a peak was present within a range of 2Î¸ of from 28.0Â° to 29.0Â°, the peak was determined to be present. Unless otherwise, it was determined that there was no peak.</p>
      <p id="p-00328-en" num="0299">With regard to Examples 1A to 24A and Comparative Examples 1A to 4A, the results of determination of whether the peak existed in a range of 2Î¸ of from 28.0Â° to 29.0Â° from the obtained X-ray diffraction spectrum are shown in Table 4. In addition, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the peak intensities X and Y were of the peaks ascribable to the crystal based on the halo portion ascribable to the non-crystal. The results of X, Y, Y/X, Xâ², Yâ², Yâ²/Xâ² are shown in Tables 4 and 5.</p>

      <p id="p-00333-en" num="0302">The ink for inkjet recording manufactured in Examples and Comparative Examples were supplied to an inkjet printer (IPSiO GX e5500, manufactured by RICOH CO., LTD.) having the structure illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and a solid image was printed with one pass. The solid image was printed on the following recording media for evaluation. After the image were dried, the luminance thereof was measured by a reflection type color spectrodensitometer (X-Rite 938, manufactured by X-Rite Incorporate).</p>
      <p id="p-00334-en" num="0303">Saturation C* was calculated by the relation: C*={(a*)<sup>2</sup>+(b*)<sup>2</sup>}<sup>1/2 </sup>from the obtained values a* and b*. The ratio k of the saturation value C* to the saturation value C*<sub>0 </sub>(=91.34) of the standard color (Japan color ver. 2) was calculated by the relation: k=C*/C*<sub>0 </sub>and evaluated according to the following evaluation criteria. The results are shown in Tables 6 and 7. Grades A and B are allowable in the evaluation criteria.</p>

Evaluation of Discharging Stability The ink for inkjet recording manufactured in Examples and Comparative Examples was set in a printer (IPSiO Gx e5500, manufacture by RICOH CO., LTD.) having a configuration illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and evaluated about the discharging stability by the following method.</p>
      <p id="p-00362-en" num="0329">Images were continuously printed for 10 minutes using the printer in which the nozzle plates described above were set. After leaving the printer at 50Â° C. and 60% RH for one month with a moisture retention cap on the head surface while the ink was attached thereto, the head was returned to the same state as before the leaving after cleaning the head. Thereafter, an intermittent printing test was conducted under the following conditions and the discharging stability was evaluated.</p>
      <p id="p-00363-en" num="0330">That is, the following printing pattern chart was printed on 20 sheets continuously and printing was halt for 20 minutes. This cycle was repeated 50 times to print the chart on 1,000 sheets in total and thereafter the printing pattern chart was printed on one more sheet, which was visually checked to evaluate the image with regard to streaks, white out, disturbance of jetting (discharging) of 5% chart solid portion according to the following criteria. The printing pattern had a printing area of 5% for each color in the entire area of the sheet and was printed with each ink under 100% duty. The printing condition is that the printing density is 600 dpiÃ300 dpi with one pass printing. The evaluation criteria are as follows: Grades A and B are allowable.
