      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a layer stack formation powder material, a powder layer stack formation hardening liquid, a layer stack formation material set, and a layer stack object formation method.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Conventionally, artificial bones have been produced from metallic materials such as stainless and a titanium alloy, wear-resistant plastics, etc., and used for bone replacement. Such artificial bones act in place of dysfunctional joints, but problematically cannot endure a long time of use, because metallic materials and wear-resistant plastics incur aging changes such as wear, corrosion, and swell. Ceramics based on calcium phosphate can be raised as a material to replace them. Currently known ceramics include those for providing scaffolding for bone formation, and those that promote formation of new bones while themselves being absorbed into the bones along with time, and transform to bones in the future.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">As bone prosthetic materials for providing scaffolding for bone formation, for example, materials such as hydroxyapatite that have excellent affinity with bone tissues and directly attach to bone tissues without a mediating material are often used. With implantation of such a bone prosthetic material into a bone defect portion, bone repair advances swiftly based on the scaffolding of the bone prosthetic material. However, hydroxyapatite cannot transform to bones by itself, and there is a risk that residual hydroxyapatite may cause troubles in the living bodies. On the other hand, any bone prosthetic material that can transform to bones can, when implanted in bone tissues, promote the osteogenic action of the bone tissues and advance bone repair easily and more swiftly.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">For example, tricalcium phosphate is known as such a material that can transform to bones. The degree of how tricalcium phosphate is absorbed into bone tissues is dependent on the shape and texture of an object made of tricalcium phosphate. That is, a porous texture object has a large surface area due to its texture, can be absorbed into bone tissues easily, and also can be phagocytosed by phagocytic cells easily. In contrast, a dense texture object is absorbed extremely slowly, and cannot be phagocytosed by phagocytic cells easily. It is expected that utilizing the characteristic differences due to the texture, and combining a porous texture portion and a dense texture portion would lead to expression of a desired biocompatibility (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 05-237278). However, none of such combination materials have strength of a level applicable as a thighbone that receives a heavy load. Further, not only does it take a long time to form such materials into a desired shape, but it is impossible to make them into a fine shape including an internal structure, particularly in the case where this process is by cutting.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Techniques of forming real three-dimensional objects based on three-dimensional shape data generated by 3D CAD or the like are generically called rapid prototyping techniques. According to an object formation method using a highly heat-resistant powder as a material among such rapid prototyping techniques, it is possible to produce a mold or a core cylinder without using a model or a wooden pattern, which makes it possible to realize an extremely fast foundry production process.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">This rapid prototyping technique is also called layer stack formation method, and stacks up cross-sectional shapes of an object as layers, and forms a three-dimensional object. Furthermore, there are proposed various layer stacking methods that are one type of the rapid prototyping techniques, and use a powder as a material (powder adherence methods) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,204,055, U.S. Pat. No. 5,902,441, U.S. Pat. No. 6,375,874, JP-A No. 09-324203, and JP-A No. 2004-42546).</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">For example, there is proposed a technique for âan artificial bone forming method by powder lamination methodâ, wherein the technique forms a powder bone material that hardens by hydration into a powder layer, to thereby form an artificial bone having a greater strength (see Japanese Patent (JP-B) No. 4575295). However, it is difficult to obtain a sufficient strength based on hardening by hydration proposed, and in particular, it is difficult to apply such a material at a portion that receives a load, such as a thighbone.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">This powder lamination object formation method is advantageous for fine shaping mentioned above. However, calcium phosphate reactive with water as used in JP-B No. 4575295 tends to transform to unabsorbable hydroxyapatite by being transplanted into a living body. In this case, the transplanted material may remain in the body for a long term and cause troubles as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Hence, it is preferable that the transplanted material be not left transformed to a crystal in the body, but be left there in a state of having potential to transform to a bone eventually. Further, for powder layer stack formation by ink jetting, it is preferable that the powder harden as soon as possible after a hardening liquid lands on the powder. Hence, it is requested to provide a hardening liquid for powder layer stack formation that can impart a bone transformation ability to the powder, can harden the powder quickly, and can form a layer stack object having a complex three-dimensional shape with a high strength and a good precision.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Calcium phosphate transplanted into a living body may not transform to a bone at a satisfactory speed, or an artificial bone implanted by a medical operation may require a considerable time before it is high time to remove an external fixator. When bone regeneration is slow, it is feared that a soft tissue may wander into the bone defect portion and inhibit bone regeneration. To promote bone regeneration, it is proposed to add a bonemaking protein such as BMP. However, even when an object made of calcium phosphate containing a bonemaking protein is formed by ink jetting, the protein will be deactivated and become ineffective if the object is burned afterwards. Hence, for object formation by ink jetting, it is preferable that a bonemaking protein be added after burning, or that bone regeneration be realized with an inorganic material that will not become ineffective even when burned. Examples of such an inorganic material include minerals such as silicon and zinc.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">Powder Layer Stack Formation Hardening Liquid</heading>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0024">A powder layer stack formation hardening liquid of the present invention contains an organic compound having phosphate group or carboxyl group, preferably contains inorganic particles, an aqueous medium, a viscosity modifier, a surfactant, and an antifoaming agent, and further contains other components according to necessity.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0025">In the present invention, it is preferable that the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid be water-soluble. Being water-soluble means that the materials constituting the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid can dissolve in water in an amount of 30% by mass or higher.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="2">&lt;Organic Compound Having Phosphate Group&gt;</heading>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0026">It is preferable that the organic compound having phosphate group be a chelate material that has an ability to capture a calcium ion contained in calcium phosphate, is non-toxic to a human body, and can be egested easily.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0027">Examples of the organic compound having phosphate group include alendronic acid, etidronic acid, and phytic acid. Among these, etidronic acid and phytic acid that have 2 or more phosphate groups per molecule are more preferable because more phosphate groups per molecule is preferable in order to improve the calcium ion capture ability.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0028">The acid value of the organic compound having phosphate group is 0.45 gKOH/g or higher, and more preferably from 0.45 gKOH/g to 1.00 gKOH/g. When the acid value is 0.45 gKOH/g or higher, advantages such as a high hardening speed, and an improved strength of a structure obtained by layer stack formation can be achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0029">The acid value can be measured according to, for example, a method described in JIS K0070-1992.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0030">The organic compound having phosphate group is suitable for use with Î²-tricalcium phosphate (Î²-TCP), Î±-tricalcium phosphate (Î±-TCP), tetracalcium phosphate, octacalcium phosphate (OCP), etc. that undergo bone transformation. Among these, materials such as Î±-tricalcium phosphate and octacalcium phosphate that have a risk of transforming to hydroxyapatite by reacting with water, and particularly, Î±-tricalcium phosphate, are/is the material(s) with which the organic compound having phosphate group is suitable for use. In this case, if the organic compound having phosphate group has a low calcium ion capture ability, these materials may transform to unabsorbable hydroxyapatite when transplanted into a living body, and may lose the bone transformation ability.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0031">The content of the organic compound having phosphate group is 20% by mass or higher, and preferably 30% by mass or higher relative to the whole amount of the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid. When the content is 20% by mass or higher, the hardening speed will be adequate, and a structure to be obtained by layer stack formation will have a favorable strength.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0000">&lt;Organic Compound having Carboxyl Group&gt;</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0032">It is preferable that the organic compound having carboxyl group be a chelate material that has an ability to capture a calcium ion contained in calcium phosphate, is non-toxic to a human body, and can be egested easily.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0033">Examples of the organic compound having carboxyl group include malic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, and edetic acid. Among these, citric acid that has 3 or more carboxyl groups per molecule and is water-soluble is more preferable because more carboxyl groups per molecule is preferable in order to improve the calcium ion capture ability.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0034">The acid value of the organic compound having carboxyl group is 0.45 gKOH/g or higher, and more preferably from 0.45 gKOH/g to 1.00 gKOH/g. When the acid value is 0.45 gKOH/g or higher, advantages such as a high hardening speed, and an improved strength of a structure to be obtained by layer stack formation can be achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0035">The acid value can be measured according to, for example, a method described in JIS K0070-1992.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0036">The organic compound having carboxyl group is suitable for use with Î²-tricalcium phosphate (Î²-TCP), Î±-tricalcium phosphate (Î±-TCP), tetracalcium phosphate, octacalcium phosphate (OCP), etc. that undergo bone transformation. Among these, materials such as Î±-tricalcium phosphate and octacalcium phosphate that have a risk of transforming to hydroxyapatite by reacting with water, and particularly, Î±-tricalcium phosphate, are/is the material(s) with which the organic compound having carboxyl group is suitable for use. In this case, if the organic compound having carboxyl group has a low calcium ion capture ability, these materials may transform to unabsorbable hydroxyapatite when transplanted into a living body, and may lose the bone transformation ability.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0037">The content of the organic compound having carboxyl group is 20% by mass or higher, and preferably 30% by mass or higher relative to the whole amount of the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid. When the content is 20% by mass or higher, the hardening speed will be adequate, and a structure to be obtained by layer stack formation will have a favorable strength.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">&lt;Inorganic Particles&gt;</heading>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0038">When added in the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid, the inorganic particles can impart an effect of promoting bone regeneration.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0039">The inorganic particles are not particularly limited, and arbitrary inorganic particles may be selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof include silica and zinc. Of these, silica is preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0040">The inorganic particles may be added as is in the form of inorganic particles in the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid. However, when silica particles are used as the inorganic particles, it is preferable that silica particles be added in the form of an antifoaming agent containing silica particles.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0041">The volume average particle diameter of the inorganic particles is preferably 10 Î¼m or less, and more preferably from 1 Î¼m to 10 Î¼m. When the volume average particle diameter is 10 Î¼m or less, the inorganic particles would not cause a discharge failure when the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid is discharged, because the inorganic particles would not clog the nozzles of a head of an inkjet printer that have a typical nozzle diameter of from 20 Î¼m to 30 Î¼m.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0042">The volume average particle diameter of the inorganic particles can be measured, for example, at 23Â° C. at 55% RH with MICROTRACK UPA manufactured by Nikkiso Co., Ltd. according to a dynamic light scattering method.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0043">The content of the inorganic particles is not particularly limited, and may be appropriately selected according to the purpose. However, it is preferably from 0.1% by mass to 1.0% by mass relative to the whole amount of the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">&lt;Aqueous Medium&gt;</heading>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0044">Examples of the aqueous medium include: water; alcohol such as ethanol; ether; and ketone. Among these, water is preferable. The water as the aqueous medium may contain a slight amount of any other component than water, such as alcohol.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0045">The content of the aqueous medium is not particularly limited, and may be appropriately selected according to the purpose.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="2">&lt;Surfactant&gt;</heading>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0046">The surfactant is not particularly limited, and an arbitrary surfactant may be selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof include: a negative ion surfactant (anionic surfactant) such as alkyl benzene sulfonic acid salt, Î±-olefin sulfonic acid salt, phosphoric acid ester, phosphoric acid ester, disulfonic acid salt, cholic acid salt, and deoxycholic acid salt; a positive ion surfactant (cationic surfactant) such as an amine salt type (e.g., alkyl amine salt, amino alcohol fatty acid derivative, polyamine fatty acid derivative, and imidazoline), and a quaternary ammonium salt type (e.g., alkyl trimethyl ammonium salt, dialkyl dimethyl ammonium salt, alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium salt, pyridinium salt, alkyl isoquinolinium salt, and benzethonium chloride); a nonionic surfactant such as fatty acid amide derivative, multivalent alcohol derivative, poly(oxyethylene)=octyl phenyl ether; and an amphoteric surfactant such as alanine, dodecyldi(aminoethyl)glycine, di(octylaminoethyl)glycine, N-alkyl-N,N-dimethyl ammonium betaine, and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]propanesulfonate (CHAPS). One of these may be used alone, or two or more of these may be used in combination. Among these, a surfactant that is liquid at room temperature (20Â° C.) is preferable in order to suppress clogging of nozzles of an inkjet head.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0047">The content of the surfactant is preferably 1% by mass or less, and more preferably from 0.1% by mass to 0.5% by mass relative to the whole amount of the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid. When the content is 1% by mass or less, the surfactant does not express cytotoxicity when a layer stack object is transplanted into a living body, because the residual amount of the surfactant in the layer stack object is low. Further, any residue of the surfactant that is left even after the layer stack object is burned does not cause troubles in a living body and is safe.</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="2">&lt;Antifoaming Agent&gt;</heading>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0048">Examples of the antifoaming agent include a silicone antifoaming agent containing silica particles, such as a compound-type silicone antifoaming agent, an emulsion-type silicone antifoaming agent, and a self-emulsifying-type silicone antifoaming agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0049">The compound-type silicone antifoaming agent is an oil-type silicone antifoaming agent in which particles of silica, alumina, or the like are dispersed in order to have a better antifoaming property.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0050">The emulsion-type silicone antifoaming agent is a compound-type antifoaming agent formed into an O/W-type emulsion by an emulsifier in order to have a better water dispersibility.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0051">The self-emulsifying-type silicone antifoaming agent contains a silicone oil and silica, and changes to an O/W-type emulsion easily when diluted with water.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0052">When a surfactant is used in the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid of the present invention, the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid has a poor surface tension and bubbles up easily. Hence, among the silicone antifoaming agents described above, a compound-type silicone antifoaming agent, an emulsion-type silicone antifoaming agent, and a self-emulsifying-type silicone antifoaming agent that contain silica having an excellent antifoaming property are preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0053">The silicone antifoaming agent may be a commercially available product. Examples of commercially available products include: KS-508, KS-531, KM-72, KM-72F, KM-73, KM-90, and KM-98 (all manufactured by Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.); SF-8427, SF-8428, SH-3749, SH-8400, FZ-2101, FZ-2104, FZ-2118, FZ-2203, and FZ-2207 (all manufactured by Dow Corning Toray Co., Ltd.); and BYK-345, BYK-346, and BYK-348 (all manufactured by Byk-Chemie Japan K.K.). One of these may be used alone, or two or more of these may be used in combination.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0054">A typical purpose of adding the antifoaming agent, in the case of adding it in a powder layer stack formation hardening liquid, is to improve various properties of the hardening liquid, such as discharge stability and storage stability. Silica particles contained in the antifoaming agent, which are inorganic particles, are known to have an effect of promoting bone regeneration.

      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0118">When the inkjet method is employed, the layer hardening unit has a nozzle capable of delivering the powder layer stack formation is hardening liquid to the layer stack formation powder material layer according to the inkjet method. The nozzle is not particularly limited, and a nozzle of a publicly-known inkjet printer can be favorably used. Further, the inkjet printer can be favorably used as the layer hardening unit. Preferable examples of the inkjet printer include SG7100 manufactured by Ricoh Company Limited. The inkjet printer is preferable in that it can perform coating at a high speed, because it can drop a large amount of the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid at a time from the head, with a wide coating coverage.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0119">In the present invention, even when an inkjet printer capable of delivering the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid precisely at a high efficiency is used, the nozzle thereof or the head thereof is not clogged or corroded, because the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid is free from a solid such as particles, and a polymeric high-viscosity material such as a resin. Therefore, there are advantages that the production efficiency of a layer stack object is excellent, and a dimensionally precise cross-linked object with no unexpected volume expansion or the like can be obtained easily, in a short time, and efficiently, because no polymeric compound such as a resin is delivered.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0120">The organic compound having phosphate group or carboxyl group used in the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid tends to exhibit a strong acidity. Typically, a preferably pH is from 5 (weakly acidic) to 12 (basic) in terms of preventing corrosion or clogging of the nozzle head portion of the nozzle used. When a phytic acid is used as the organic compound having phosphate group, corrosion does not occur to the contrary, because phytic acid forms an anticorrosive coating over the surface of a metal such as SUS. Hence, a phytic acid is used favorably as the organic compound having phosphate group.</p>

      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0121">The sintering step is a step of sintering a hardened layer stack object formed by repeating the layer forming step and the layer hardening step sequentially, and is performed by the sintering unit. Through the sintering step, the hardened object can be made into an integrated compact (sintered compact). Examples of the sintering unit include a publicly-known sintering furnace.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0122">The sintering step may be performed not only in the above described manner of performing sintering after a hardened object is obtained, but also in a manner of performing sintering during the stage of stacking the layers of the layer stack formation powder material.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0123">The method for performing sintering during the stage of stacking the layers of the layer stack formation powder material may be a method irradiating the layer stack formation powder material layer with either laser or an electron beam to thereby sinter the layer stack formation powder material layer.</p>

Examples thereof include CO<sub>2 </sub>laser, Nd-YAG laser, fiber laser, and semiconductor laser.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0125">Conditions for the laser irradiation are not particularly limited, and arbitrary conditions may be selected according to the purpose. However, when a small-sized laser is used, in which case, the calcium phosphate powder cannot be melted, it is preferable to mix the calcium phosphate powder with an adhesive (e.g., a polyester-based adhesive), which is to be used in combination, and to melt the adhesive by laser irradiation, to thereby form an object. In this case, CO<sub>2 </sub>laser is preferable. Preferable irradiation conditions are a laser output of 15 W, a wavelength of 10.6 Î¼m, and a beam diameter of about 0.4 mm.</p>
      <heading id="h-00027-en" level="2">âElectron Beam Irradiationâ</heading>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0126">There are not particular limitations to the electron beam, as long as it has energy enough to melt the calcium phosphate powder. Before irradiated with the electron beam, the layer stack formation powder material needs to be treated under vacuum conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0127">Conditions for the electron beam irradiation are not particularly limited, and arbitrary conditions may be selected according to the purpose. However, preferable conditions are an output of 1,500 W, a beam diameter of 0.1 mm, and a degree of vacuum of about 1.0Ã10<sup>â5 </sup>mbar.</p>

Examples of the drying unit include a publicly-known dryer.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0131">The surface protection treatment step is a step of forming a protection layer over a layer stack object formed in the layer hardening step or the sintering step.

      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0233">A layer stack object A1-2 was formed in the manner described below, using the layer stack formation powder material A1-1 prepared in Preparation Example A2-1 and the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid A1-2, and a shape printing pattern having a size of 70 mm in length and 12 mm in width.</p>
      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0234">(1) First, using such a publicly-known powder layer stack formation apparatus as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the layer stack formation powder material A1-1 was delivered from the supply-side powder storage tank to the formation-side powder storage tank, to thereby form a thin layer of the layer stack formation powder material A1-1 having an average thickness of 100 Î¼m over the support member.</p>
      <p id="p-00240-en" num="0235">(2) Next, using an inkjet printer (SG7100 manufactured by Ricoh Company, Ltd.), the powder layer stack formation hardening liquid A1-2 was delivered (discharged) onto the surface of the formed thin layer of the layer stack formation powder material A1-1 from a nozzle, to capture calcium ions contained in the layer stack formation powder material A1-1 by functioning of the organic compound having phosphate group or carboxyl group, to thereby harden the calcium phosphate. The hardening speed of the hardened object was extremely fast. The hardening speed was measured in the sane manner as in Example A1-1. The result is shown in Table 6.</p>
      <p id="p-00241-en" num="0236">(3) Next, the operations (1) and (2) were repeated up to a predetermined total average thickness of 3 mm, and hardened thin layers of the layer stack formation powder material A1-1 were stacked up sequentially, to thereby form a layer stack object A1-2. The obtained layer stack object A1-2 was air-blown to remove any excess of the layer stack formation powder material A1-1, and as a result, did not have a shape collapse. The obtained layer stack object A1-2 was excellent in strength and dimensional precision.</p>
      <p id="p-00242-en" num="0237">A hydroxyapatite (HAp) transformation rate, cytotoxicity, bone inducing ability, strength (hardness), and dimensional precision of the obtained layer stack object A1-2 were evaluated in the same manner as in Example A1-1. The results are shown in Table A6.</p>
      <p id="p-00243-en" num="0238">(4) The layer stack object A1-2 obtained in (3) was sintered in a sintering furnace under vacuum conditions at 1,300Â° C.

(40 parts by mass), and a surfactant, which was TRITON X-100 (manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) (0.5 parts by mass) were mixed, and dispersed with a homomixer for 5 minutes, to thereby prepare hardening agent-containing water C1.</p>
      <heading id="h-00182-en" level="1">Example C1</heading>
      <p id="p-00461-en" num="0438">A layer stack object C1 was formed in the manner described below, using the obtained layer stack formation powder material C1 and hardening agent-containing water C1, and a shape printing pattern having a size of 70 mm in length and 12 mm in width.</p>
      <p id="p-00462-en" num="0439">(1) First, using such a publicly-known powder layer stack formation apparatus as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the layer stack formation powder material C1 was delivered from the supply-side powder storage tank to the formation-side powder storage tank, to thereby form a thin layer of the layer stack formation powder material C1 having an average thickness of 100 Î¼m over the support member.</p>
      <p id="p-00463-en" num="0440">(2) Next, using an inkjet printer (SG7100 manufactured by Ricoh Company, Ltd.), the hardening agent-containing water C1 was delivered (discharged) onto the surface of the formed thin layer of the layer stack formation powder material C1 from a nozzle, to harden the layer stack formation powder material C1, to thereby harden the calcium phosphate.</p>
      <p id="p-00464-en" num="0441">(3) Next, the operations (1) and (2) were repeated up to a predetermined total average thickness of 3 mm, and hardened thin layers of the layer stack formation powder material C1 were stacked up sequentially, to thereby form a layer stack object C1. The obtained layer stack object C1 was air-blown to remove any excess of the layer stack formation powder material, and as a result, did not have a shape collapse. The obtained layer stack object C1 was excellent in strength and dimensional precision.</p>
      <p id="p-00465-en" num="0442">Strength (hardness), and dimensional precision of the obtained layer stack object C1 were evaluated in the same manner as in Example A1-1. The results are shown in Table C1.</p>
      <p id="p-00466-en" num="0443">(4) The layer stack object C1 obtained in (3) was sintered in a sintering furnace under vacuum conditions at 1,300Â° C. The layer stack object C1 was a completely integrated calcium phosphate structure, and had no breakage or the like when slammed to a hard floor.</p>
