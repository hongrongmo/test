  <description id="descr_eng" lang="eng" format="original" date-changed="20151104">
    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a brake plate assembly for a drag mechanism of a fishing reel. The present invention also relates to a fishing reel having a brake plate assembly for a drag mechanism.</p>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In general, a fishing reel comprises a drag mechanism. A drag mechanism applies a braking force to a spool when the spool rotates in the line unreeling (delivering) direction. In particular, in a drag mechanism, a braking structure is able to brake a spool via a rotation transmission mechanism. Here, the rotation transmission mechanism is configured by a drive shaft, a drive gear, a pinion gear, etc.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Specifically, the braking structure comprises a plurality of brake plates and a plurality of lining materials. The lining materials are disposed between adjacent brake plates and generate frictional force along with the brake plates. In such a braking structure, the pressure state of the brake plate and the lining material, that is, the frictional force of the brake plate and the lining material are changed by a drag adjustment mechanism. Accordingly, the braking force (the drag force) that is applied to the spool is changed.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Fiber material, such as wool felt, or a resin material, such as PTFE, are used as material for a conventional lining material. Grease is applied to a wool felt lining material when this is used. In contrast, since a PTFE lining material is formed by a resin material, the plate thickness can be molded to be thin, as compared to a wool felt lining material. Additionally, the PTFE lining material is only slightly deformed by compression and does not require the application of grease. In this manner, the PTFE lining material can have a more favorable characteristic than a wool felt lining material, as disclosed e.g. in <patcit id="pcit-00001" dnum="JP2002218880A"><text>JP 2002-218880 A</text></patcit> or <patcit id="pcit-00002" dnum="JP2002238421B"><text>JP 2002-238421 B1</text></patcit>.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Meanwhile, there are cases in which the lining material, with a mixture of reinforcing fiber material, is used to enhance the heat resistance, durability, and flexibility of the lining material. Here, the reinforcing fiber is a fibrous material with excellent heat resistance and wear resistance. Specifically, <patcit id="pcit-00003" dnum="JP2003000114A"><text>JP 2003-000114 A</text></patcit> discloses that carbon fiber, aramid fiber, glass fiber, etc., are used as the reinforcing fiber.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">As described above, conventionally, the performance of braking structures of drive mechanisms has been improved by using various lining materials. However, in recent years, as the performance of fishing reels has improved, further improvement in the performance of the braking structure have been expected. For example, various attempts have been made to exert a greater drag force than conventional technology by improving the frictional force in the braking structure. More specifically, attempts have been made to use a metal-based sintered material for the lining material of the braking structure.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">When a metal-based sintered material is used for the lining material and the lining material slides with a conventional brake plate, such as an aluminum brake plate, there is the risk that the brake plate will be worn out due to the friction between the lining material and the brake plate. That is, there is the risk that the frictional force between the lining material and the brake plate will decline and that the drag force that was assumed at the time of design cannot be maintained. On the other hand, when the brake plate is changed to a material that is harder than the above-described material in order to solve this problem, such as a stainless steel material, the weight of the brake plate will increase. That is, a problem occurs when the weight of the entire reel increases.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The present invention was made in light of the problems described above, and an object of the present invention is to provide a brake plate assembly for a drag mechanism that is able to simultaneously enhance the drag force as well as reduce the weight. Another object is to provide a fishing reel having this brake plate assembly for a drag mechanism.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">A brake plate assembly for a drag mechanism of a fishing reel according to the first aspect of the invention comprises a first brake plate and a second brake plate. The first brake plate comprises a first bonding surface. The second brake plate comprises a second bonding surface. The second bonding surface is bonded to the first bonding surface of the first brake plate. The wear resistance of the second brake plate is greater than that of the first brake plate.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In the present brake plate assembly, the first bonding surface of the first brake plate and the second bonding surface of the second brake plate are bonded together. A brake plate assembly having this configuration functions as a standalone brake plate. Additionally, since the wear resistance of the second brake plate is greater than that of the first brake plate, there is the possibility that a lining material can come into frictional contact with the second brake plate. That is, in the present brake plate assembly, the portion where the lining material comes into frictional contact is formed by the second brake plate, and the portion where the lining material does not come into frictional contact is formed by the first brake plate. Accordingly, the drag force can be enhanced by the second brake plate, and the weight can be reduced with the first brake plate. That is, it is possible to provide a brake plate assembly for a drag mechanism that is able to simultaneously enhance the drag force and reduce the weight.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In a brake plate assembly for a drag mechanism of a fishing reel according to the second aspect of the invention, the first brake plate in the brake plate assembly recited in the first aspect of the invention is an aluminum alloy.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In this embodiment, since the first brake plate is an aluminum alloy, the weight of the brake plate assembly can be reduced.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In a brake plate assembly for a drag mechanism of a fishing reel according to the third aspect of the invention, the second brake plate in the brake plate assembly recited in the first or second aspect of the invention is a stainless steel alloy.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In this embodiment, since the second brake plate is a stainless steel alloy, the wear resistance of the brake plate assembly can be enhanced.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In a brake plate assembly for a drag mechanism of a fishing reel according to the fourth aspect of the invention, either the first brake plate or the second brake plate in the brake plate assembly recited in any one of the first to the third aspects of the invention comprises at least one first hole.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In this embodiment, it is possible to reduce the weight of the brake plate assembly by forming at least one first hole in at least one of the first brake plate or the second brake plate.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In a brake plate assembly for a drag mechanism of a fishing reel according to the fifth aspect of the invention, the first hole in the brake plate assembly recited in the fourth aspect of the invention extends in the thickness direction of at least one of the first brake plate or the second brake plate. In particular, the first hole extends through in the thickness direction of at least one of the first brake plate or the second brake plate.</p>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">In this embodiment, effectively reducing the weight while maintaining the strength of a brake plate is possible by forming a first hole in the thickness direction of at least one of the first brake plate or the second brake plate.</p>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In a brake plate assembly for a drag mechanism of a fishing reel according to the sixth aspect of the invention, the first hole in the brake plate assembly recited in the fourth or fifth aspects of the invention extends in a direction that intersects with the thickness direction described above.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In this embodiment, since the first hole extends in a direction that intersects with the thickness direction described above, effectively reducing the weight while maintaining the bonding strength is possible because the bonding area of the bonding surfaces of the first brake plate and the second brake plate (the first bonding surface and the second bonding surface) can be maintained.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">A brake plate assembly for a drag mechanism of a fishing reel according to the seventh aspect of the invention further comprises a third brake plate in a brake plate assembly recited in any one of the first to the sixth aspects of the invention. The first brake plate further comprises a third bonding surface. The third bonding surface is disposed on the opposite side of the first bonding surface of the first brake plate. The third brake plate comprises a fourth bonding surface. The fourth bonding surface is bonded to the third bonding surface of the first brake plate. The wear resistance of the third brake plate is greater than that of the first brake plate.</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In this embodiment, the first bonding surface of the first brake plate and the second bonding surface of the second brake plate are bonded together, and the third bonding surface of the first brake plate and the fourth bonding surface of the third brake plate are bonded together. That is, the brake plate assembly functions as a standalone brake plate in a state in which the first brake plate is disposed between the second brake plate and the third brake plate.</p>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Additionally, in this embodiment, since the wear resistance of the second brake plate and the wear resistance of the third brake plate are greater than that of the first brake plate, there is the possibility that a lining material can come into frictional contact with the second brake plate and the third brake plate. That is, in the present brake plate assembly, the portion where the lining material comes into frictional contact is formed by the second brake plate and the third brake plate, and the portion where the lining material does not come into frictional contact is formed by the first brake plate. Accordingly, the drag force can be enhanced by the second brake plate and the third brake plate, and the weight can be reduced with the first brake plate. That is, it is possible to provide a brake plate assembly for a drag mechanism that is able to simultaneously enhance the drag force and reduce the weight.</p>

    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In this embodiment, since the third brake plate is formed by a stainless steel alloy, the wear resistance of the brake plate assembly can be enhanced.</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In a brake plate assembly for a drag mechanism of a fishing reel according to the ninth aspect of the invention, the wear resistance of the third brake plate is greater than that of the second brake plate in the brake plate assembly recited in the seventh or eighth aspect of the invention.</p>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In this embodiment, since the wear resistance of the third brake plate is greater than that of the second brake plate, it is possible to form the lining material on the third brake plate side from a material with a higher friction strength or a material with a different characteristic than the lining material on the second brake plate side. In this manner, since the selection of lining material can be widened, the adjustment range of the drag performance (the friction performance) can be expanded.</p>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In a brake plate assembly for a drag mechanism of a fishing reel according to the tenth aspect of the invention, the thickness of the third brake plate is greater than the thickness of the second brake plate in a brake plate assembly recited in any one of the seventh to the ninth aspects of the invention.</p>

    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In the present fishing reel, the braking structure comprises a first lining material, a second lining material, a first brake plate assembly, and a second brake plate assembly. The first brake plate assembly functions as a standalone brake plate in a state in which the fourth brake plate and the fifth brake plate are bonded together, as described above.
