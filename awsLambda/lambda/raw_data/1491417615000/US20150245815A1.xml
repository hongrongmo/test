      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings. Note that in each of the drawings used for the below description, components are illustrated on difference scales so that the respective components have sizes that are large enough to be recognized in the drawing, and the present invention is not limited only to the counts and amounts, and the shapes of the components, and the size ratios and the relative positional relationships among the components illustrated in the drawings.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">An example of an embodiment of an ultrasound transducer according to the present invention will be described below. An ultrasound observation section <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, which is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, includes an ultrasound transducer <b>1</b><i>a </i>that includes a piezoelectric element array <b>2</b> including a plurality of piezoelectric elements <b>3</b>. The ultrasound transducer <b>1</b><i>a </i>is an electronic scanning ultrasound probe. <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram of the ultrasound observation section <b>1</b> as viewed in a direction along a plane on which a scan using an ultrasound beam is performed by the ultrasound transducer <b>1</b><i>a </i>(referred to as a scan surface) (arrow A in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Note that the count and the arrangement of the plurality of piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> included in the piezoelectric element array <b>2</b> are not specifically limited, and one-dimensional array (1D array) in which the plurality of piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> are arranged in a row, or a two-dimensional array (2D array) in which the plurality of piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> are arranged in a matrix may be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Also, as forms of a piezoelectric element array including a plurality of piezoelectric elements arranged in a matrix, a configuration, generally called â1.25D arrayâ, that allows a width of an ultrasound beam to be varied, and a configuration, generally called â1.5D arrayâ, that allows a width and a focal length of an ultrasound beam to be varied are known. The piezoelectric element array <b>2</b> may employ such form called â1.25D arrayâ or â1.5D arrayâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Also, where the piezoelectric element array <b>2</b> is a one-dimensional array, a form in which the plurality of piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> are arranged along a straight line or a form in which the plurality of piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> are arranged along a curved line may be employed. Also, where the piezoelectric element array <b>2</b> has a form in which a plurality of piezoelectric elements are arranged in a matrix like, for example, a 1.25D array, a 1.5D array or a 2D array, a form in which the plurality of piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> are arranged along one or a plurality of planes or a form in which the plurality of piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> are arranged along one or a plurality of curved surfaces may be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In the present embodiment, as an example, the piezoelectric element array <b>2</b> included in the ultrasound transducer <b>1</b> a has a form of a 1.25D array in which the plurality of piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> are arranged in a matrix on a substantially cylindrical plane. The piezoelectric element array <b>2</b> is configured so that a circumferential direction of the substantially cylindrical plane corresponds to a scan direction, and an ultrasound beam scan can be performed in a substantially fan-like form. The ultrasound observation section <b>1</b> including the piezoelectric element array <b>2</b> having such form is generally called âconvex typeâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Although described in detail later, the ultrasound transducer <b>1</b><i>a </i>is housed in a housing section <b>21</b>. The housing section <b>21</b> is configured to hold the ultrasound transducer <b>1</b><i>a </i>with an ultrasound transmission/reception surface thereof exposed.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The ultrasound observation section <b>1</b> receives a signal sent from an ultrasound observation apparatus <b>22</b> via a connection portion <b>20</b> and generates ultrasound. Also, the ultrasound observation section transmits a received ultrasound signal to the ultrasound observation apparatus <b>22</b> via the connection portion <b>20</b>, whereby an ultrasound image is obtained.

      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">A configuration of the ultrasound observation section <b>1</b> and a configuration of the ultrasound transducer la included in the ultrasound observation section <b>1</b> will be described in detail below. <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the ultrasound observation section <b>1</b> cut along a plane parallel to a scan surface. <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the ultrasound observation section <b>1</b> cut along a plane perpendicular to the scan surface. <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is an enlarged perspective view of a single unit of a piezoelectric element <b>3</b> and a wire <b>7</b> included in the ultrasound transducer <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p>

The lead complex perovskite is a material expressed by Pb(B1, B2)03 in which B1 is any of magnesium, zinc, indium and scandium and B2 is any of niobium, tantalum and tungsten.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">These materials provide an excellent piezoelectric effect. Thus, a value of electrical impedance can be made low even though the piezoelectric elements are downsized, which is favorable from the viewpoint of impedance matching between piezoelectric elements and wirings.</p>

Supposing that the wires <b>7</b> are in a tensioned state, the tension of the wires <b>7</b> is applied to the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b>, which may hinder oscillation of the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b>.

      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">A surface of the second conductive layer <b>5</b> on the side opposite to the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b>, an acoustic matching layer <b>6</b> is disposed. The acoustic matching layer <b>6</b> is provided to perform acoustic impedance matching between the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> and an object or subject. In the present embodiment, as an example, the acoustic matching layer <b>6</b> is configured by depositing a first acoustic matching layer <b>6</b><i>a </i>and a second acoustic matching layer <b>6</b><i>b</i>, which form a plurality of layers formed of different materials.

      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">For more details, in the present embodiment, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the second conductive layer <b>5</b>, which is a metal thin film, is formed on an inner face of the first acoustic matching layer <b>6</b><i>a</i>.

      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">For the circuit board <b>8</b> in the present embodiment, a glass epoxy substrate including glass fiber and an epoxy resin is used as an electrical insulating base material <b>8</b><i>c</i>.

      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In the present embodiment, the circuit board <b>8</b> includes five conductive layers consisting of three signal circuit layer <b>8</b><i>a </i>and two ground layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>disposed among the three signal circuit layers <b>8</b><i>a</i>.

Interposition of the ground layers <b>8</b><i>b</i>, which are each in the form of what is called a solid electrode, among the signal circuit layers <b>8</b><i>a </i>enables prevention of crosstalk among the plurality of signal circuit layers <b>8</b><i>a</i>. Note that the circuit board <b>8</b> may be divided into a plurality of parts in a thickness direction and a plane direction.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The circuit board <b>8</b> is disposed in such a manner that the thickness direction is substantially perpendicular to the scan surface of the ultrasound observation section <b>1</b> on the inner side relative to the first electrode <b>4</b><i>a</i>.

A positional relationship between the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> and the circuit board <b>8</b> is fixed by the backing material <b>9</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The three signal circuit layers <b>8</b><i>a </i>have respective wiring patterns corresponding to the three rows of piezoelectric elements <b>3</b>, respectively. In other words, in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the center signal circuit layer <b>8</b><i>a </i>provides an electrical circuit electrically connected to the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> included in the center row, the signal circuit layer <b>8</b><i>a </i>on the right side in the Figure provides an electrical circuit electrically connected to the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> included in the right row in the Figure, and the signal circuit layer <b>8</b><i>a </i>on the left side in the Figure provides an electrical circuit electrically connected to the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> included in the left row in Figure.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The wiring patterns formed by the signal circuit layers <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>8</b> and the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> are electrically connected by the wires <b>7</b>. Here, a form of the electrical connection between the wiring patterns of the circuit board <b>8</b> and proximal ends of the wires <b>7</b> is not specifically limited. For example, a form in which the wiring patterns of the circuit board <b>8</b> and the proximal ends of the wires <b>7</b> are connected by means of, e.g., soldering or a conductive adhesive, or a form in which the wiring patterns of the circuit board <b>8</b> and the proximal ends of the wires <b>7</b> are connected by means of a bonding method known as what is called a wire bonding method may be employed. Also, as described above, the wires <b>7</b> may have a form of flying leads that are formed by making the signal circuit layers <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>8</b> extend outward and are integrated with the wiring patterns at the proximal ends thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">In the other hand, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the distal ends of the wires <b>7</b> and the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> that are in contact with each other are bonded by at least surfaces of the distal end portions of the wires <b>7</b> and the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>being coated with a metal film <b>13</b> having a predetermined thickness.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The metal film <b>13</b> is formed by an electroplating method. Although described in detail later, the metal film <b>13</b> is formed by immersing at least the distal end portions of the wires <b>7</b> and the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>that are in contact with each other in an electrolyte solution (plating solution) and making current flow in the wires <b>7</b> so that the wires <b>7</b> and the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>are plated.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Therefore, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the distal end sides of the wires <b>7</b> are coated in a cylindrical shape by the metal film <b>13</b> having a uniform thickness, and the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>are also coated in a uniform thickness that is equal to the thickness of the coating of the wire <b>7</b> by the metal film <b>13</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">This is specific to an electroplating method, and with a conventional method using soldering, wires cannot be coated by a metal film having a uniform thickness, and neither a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method nor a physical vapor deposition (PVD) method can also provide such coating. Furthermore, use of an electroplating method prevents thermal load from being imposed on the piezoelectric elements, whereby depolarization of the piezoelectric elements is suppressed, enabling prevention of piezoelectric effect decrease or elimination.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">There are no specific limitations on the thickness and the material of the metal film <b>13</b> and the detailed method of electroplating as long as they provide electrical connection between the distal ends of the wires <b>7</b> and the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> by means of the coating with the metal film <b>13</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">For example, when the metal film <b>13</b> is formed, use of a pulse plating method in which current is made to flow intermittently makes the metal film <b>13</b> dense and enhances the reliability of bonding provided by the metal film <b>13</b> and thus is preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Also, for example, if the metal film <b>13</b> is formed by nickel sulfamate plating or copper pyrophosphate plating, inner stress in the metal film <b>13</b> can be reduced to be lower than that provided by any other nickel plating, enabling the metal film <b>13</b> to be relatively thick. Also, in order to reduce inner stress in the metal film <b>13</b>, a stress reliever may be used in the electroplating.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">For example, an upper limit of the thickness of the metal film <b>13</b> is determined as follows, according to physical properties of the material forming the metal film <b>13</b> and a wavelength of ultrasound to be transmitted/received by the ultrasound observation section <b>1</b>. In the present embodiment, where a wavelength, in the material forming the metal film <b>13</b>, of ultrasound having a highest frequency from among ultrasounds to be transmitted/received by the ultrasound observation section <b>1</b> is Î», an upper limit tmax of the thickness of the metal film <b>13</b> is preferably Î»/10 or less, more preferably, Î»/20 or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">For example, where the metal film <b>13</b> is of nickel, a longitudinal sound velocity C in nickel is approximately 6000 m/s. Here, where the upper limit of the frequency of ultrasound to be transmitted/received by the ultrasound observation section 1 is 15 MHz, the wavelength X of the ultrasound in nickel is approximately 400 Î¼m. Therefore, the upper limit tmax of the thickness of the metal film <b>13</b> where the metal film <b>13</b> is of nickel is preferably 40 Î¼m, more preferably 20 Î¼m.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Also, for example, where the metal film <b>13</b> is of copper, a longitudinal sound velocity C in copper is approximately 5000 m/s. Here, where the upper limit of the frequency of ultrasound to be transmitted/received by the ultrasound observation section 1 is 15 MHz, the wavelength <b>2</b> of the ultrasound in copper is approximately 333 Î¼m. Therefore, the upper limit tmax of the thickness of the metal film <b>13</b> where the metal film <b>13</b> is of copper is preferably 33 Î¼m, more preferably 16 Î¼m.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">In the present embodiment, the thickness of the metal film <b>13</b> is, for example, no less than 0.1 Î¼m and no more than 15 Î¼m, preferably approximately no less than 0.5 Î¼m and no more than 5 Î¼m in consideration of a balance between a bonding strength and a current capacity, and an effect of existence of the metal film <b>13</b> on acoustic properties of the piezoelectric element <b>3</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Also, as described above, it is preferable that the wires <b>7</b> be bonded to the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>in a sagged state in which no tension is applied to the wires <b>7</b>. Furthermore, it is preferable that the wires <b>7</b> be handled so as to include no parts that are parallel to the first faces <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b>. This is intended to prevent ultrasound transmitted from the first faces <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> from being reflected by the wires <b>7</b> and returned to the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">Also, in the present embodiment, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, at a stage before bonding between the wires <b>7</b> and the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a</i>, the distal ends of the wires <b>7</b> are melted to have a substantially spherical shape. As a result of the distal ends of the wires <b>7</b> having a substantially spherical shape, the area of contact between the distal end of each wire <b>7</b> and the corresponding first electrode <b>4</b><i>a </i>can be kept substantially constant regardless of the angle of the distal end of the wire <b>7</b> relative to the first electrode <b>4</b><i>a</i>, whereby the electrical connection between the distal end of the wire <b>7</b> and the first electrode <b>4</b><i>a </i>is stabilized.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">As in the present embodiment, for example, depending on the type of the metal used, bonding the wires <b>7</b> and the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>by means of the metal film <b>13</b> enables provision of a high chemical resistance compared to bonding using a conductive adhesive or an anisotropic conductive sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Also, in the present embodiment, for all the piezoelectric bodies <b>3</b> included in the piezoelectric element array <b>2</b>, the wires <b>7</b> and the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>are bonded by a homogeneous metal film <b>13</b> formed by an electroplating method. Thus, the bonding between the wires <b>7</b> and the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>is homogeneous in the entire piezoelectric element array <b>2</b>, enabling reduction in variation of electrical resistance in bonding parts, which occurs when a conductive resin is used. Therefore, transmission and reception characteristics of the ultrasound transducer la can be stabilized.</p>

      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">Next, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, the entire side wall portions <b>10</b> are fixed to a first acoustic matching layer <b>6</b><i>a</i>, and a backing material <b>9</b> is charged and cured in a space surrounded by the side wall portions <b>10</b>. As a result of the backing material <b>9</b> being cured, the circuit board <b>8</b> is fixed to the first acoustic matching layer <b>6</b><i>a</i>.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">Note that a process of coating surfaces of the metal films <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> with an electrical insulating material may be added between the formation of the metal films <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> by the electroplating process and the charging of the backing material <b>9</b>. The coating with the electrical insulating material can be formed by, for example, an electrodeposition method. As descried above, peripheries of the wires <b>7</b> are coated by an electrical insulating material, enabling prevention of deformation of a wire <b>7</b> and short-circuit between the wire <b>7</b> and another wire <b>7</b> when the backing material <b>9</b> is charged.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">In the manufacturing method described above, for example, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, where the electroplating process is started in a state in which the distal end of a wire <b>7</b> is not in contact with the corresponding first electrode <b>4</b><i>a</i>, no metal film <b>13</b> is formed on the first electrode <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> (the right first electrode <b>4</b><i>a </i>in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>) that is not in contact with the wire <b>7</b>. Thus, in the present embodiment, whether or not the respective wires <b>7</b> are in contact with the corresponding first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>can visually be checked easily and reliably during the electroplating process. If such check is made at an early stage of the electroplating process and the work for correcting the shape of a wire <b>7</b> for a first electrode <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> with no metal film <b>13</b> formed thereon is performed, bonding between all the wires <b>7</b> and the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>can be ensured.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">As described above, the ultrasound observation section <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment includes: the plurality of piezoelectric elements <b>3</b>, the first electrode <b>4</b><i>a </i>formed on one surface of each piezoelectric element <b>3</b>, the conductive wire <b>7</b> including a distal end that is in contact with the first electrode <b>4</b><i>a</i>; and the metal film <b>13</b> formed by an electroplating method, the metal film <b>13</b> coating at least the distal end of the wire <b>7</b> in a uniform thickness along a shape of the wire <b>7</b> and further coating the first electrode <b>4</b><i>a </i>in a thickness that is equal to the thickness of the coating of the wire <b>7</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">In the ultrasound observation section <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, an electrical wiring connected to a first electrode <b>4</b><i>a</i>, which is an electrode of each piezoelectric element <b>3</b>, is a thin wire <b>7</b>, and the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>and the wires <b>7</b> are bonded by the metal film <b>13</b>, which is a conductive thin film formed by an electroplating method.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">Therefore, the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>and the wires <b>7</b> can be bonded without heating of the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> to a temperature at which the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> are depolarized, enabling provision of an ultrasound transducer with suppressed piezoelectric element depolarization during manufacture.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, members that are in contact with the respective piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> for electrical wiring are the wires <b>7</b> and the metal film <b>13</b> only, which are light, and an effect of these members for wiring on oscillation of the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> is very small. Therefore, the ultrasound observation section <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment enables use of fine piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> while deterioration in acoustic properties is suppressed. This contributes to, for example, enhancement in resolution and sensitivity of small-size ultrasound transducers that can be introduced into a living body such as a human body, such as ultrasound endoscopes.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, for all the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> included in the ultrasound transducer <b>1</b><i>a</i>, the wires <b>7</b> and the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>are bonded by a homogenous metal film <b>13</b> formed by one electroplating process. Therefore, the work for electrical wiring is considerably easy compared to, for example, cases where a wire is bonded to each piezoelectric element by means of soldering, and a piezoelectric element array <b>2</b> using finer piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> can be manufactured.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">Also, in the present embodiment, it is preferable that each piezoelectric element <b>3</b> includes a PMN-PT single crystal, a PMN-PZT single crystal, a PZN-PT single crystal, a PIN-PZN-PT single crystal or another relaxer material. A piezoelectric element <b>3</b> including any of these materials has a low Curie point, and thus is depolarized when a heating process such as soldering is used, resulting decrease or elimination of the piezoelectric effect. In the present embodiment, the wires <b>7</b> and the first electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>can be bonded by an electroplating method without heating, enabling use of any of these materials having large relative permittivity. As a result of the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> being formed by a material having large relative permittivity, as described above, a value of electrical impedance can be made low even if the piezoelectric elements <b>3</b> are miniaturized.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">Note that the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and arbitrary alterations can be made without departing from the spirit and idea of the invention that can be read from the claims and the entire description, and an ultrasound transducer and an ultrasound transducer manufacturing method with such change also fall within the technical scope of the present invention.</p>
