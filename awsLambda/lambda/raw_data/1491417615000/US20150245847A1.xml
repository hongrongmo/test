      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to endoscopic or laparoscopic surgery and more particularly to end effector assemblies for surgical instruments used therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The trend in surgical procedures is to reduce the invasiveness of the procedure by reducing the size of the surgical incision. More and more frequently, the surgical incision is performed in the navel of the patient. For a laparoscopic surgical instrument, the outer shaft diameter is determined by the inner diameter of the ports (cannulae) with which the instrument will be used. As port size decreases to accommodate the reduced size of the surgical incision, the diameter/cross-sectional area of the end effectors of the surgical instrument must be reduced while the length of the end effectors must also be reduced to provide greater rigidity to reduce the susceptibility of the end effectors to deflection.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The resulting rigidity of the end effectors of the instrument thereby necessitates tight dimensional tolerances and a corresponding increase in material and manufacturing costs to provide the necessary rigidity.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">To advance the state of the art of surgery, the present disclosure relates to a method of performing surgery that includes the steps of providing a forceps having a housing including a shaft that extends therefrom and at least one handle moveable relative to the housing and providing an end effector assembly configured to selectively engage a distal end of the shaft. The method also includes the steps of inserting the forceps through a first opening formed in a body; inserting the end effector assembly through a second opening formed in the body; engaging the end effector assembly with the distal end of the shaft in vivo; and actuating the end effector assembly by moving the handle relative to the housing.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The method may include the step of providing a coupling at the distal end of the shaft, and may further include the step of engaging, via the coupling, the distal end of the shaft with the end effector assembly.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Various embodiments of the present disclosure are described hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. Well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail to avoid obscuring the present disclosure in unnecessary detail.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The present disclosure relates to a laparoscopic surgical instrument having a mating joint to enable attachment and detachment of a detachable end effector. The detachable end effector may be introduced into the abdominal cavity through a surgical incision such as at the navel while the laparoscopic surgical instrument is introduced, without the detachable end effector, into the abdominal cavity through another surgical incision. Alternatively, the detachable end effector may be introduced through a natural orifice such as the anal canal, while the laparoscopic surgical instrument is introduced, without the detachable end effector, through a surgical incision in the abdominal cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The detachable end effector may be introduced by a second instrument, such as a grasper, which is used to attach or connect the detachable end effector to the mating joint of the instrument.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">As compared to conventional laparoscopic surgical instruments, since the detachable end effector is introduced through a natural orifice of the patient, the length and the diameter of the detachable end effector of the laparoscopic surgical instrument according to the embodiments of the present disclosure may be increased.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Removal of the diameter and length constraints of the end effectors of the prior art generally allows for looser tolerances and more cost effective end effector fabrication processes. As the diameter is a significant factor in determining the necessary rigidity of the end effector assembly, a larger-diameter end effector assembly can be a longer end effector assembly because the end effector assembly will be less susceptible to deflection and thus provide a more uniform distribution of sealing pressure to the tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">As is well-known in the art, deflection of a cantilevered beam, which can approximate the deflection of the end effector assembly with respect to the shaft of the endoscopic instrument, is directly proportional to the distance of the applied load from an anchor point, in this case, the joint between the end effector assembly and the shaft, and inversely proportional to Young's modulus of elasticity E and the moment of inertia I of the end effector assembly, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>. For an assumed rectangular cross-section <b>2</b>â² of the beam <b>2</b> as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>, since the moment of inertia I<sub>x </sub>around the x-axis is proportional to the width b times the cube of the height h, i.e., h<sup>3</sup>, it can be seen that an increase in height h, while b remains constant, significantly increases the moment of inertia I<sub>x</sub>. As can then be seen from <figref>FIGS. 1B-1C</figref>, if the beam <b>2</b> is assumed to be a cantilevered beam anchored at anchor point <b>4</b>, representing the distal end of a shaft of an endoscopic instrument, the deflection v in the y-direction is directly proportional to the applied load P and the cube of the distance a from the anchor point <b>4</b>, i.e., a<sup>3</sup>. Since the load P and the cube of the distance a are independent of the moment of inertia I<sub>x</sub>, it can then be understood that any increase in moment of inertia I<sub>x </sub>(while the other factors remain the same) will reduce the deflection v. <figref>FIG. 1D</figref> simply illustrates the same effect if one assumes a bending moment M<sub>0 </sub>around anchor point <b>4</b> instead of load P.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Following completion of the surgical procedure, the detachable end effector having an enlarged moment of inertia and rigidity is detached from the mating joint via the second instrument, which may again be introduced through the natural orifice and used to withdraw the detachable end effector from the abdominal cavity while the laparoscopic surgical instrument is withdrawn through the surgical incision.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In the drawings and in the descriptions which follow, the term âproximalâ, as is traditional, will refer to the end of the forceps <b>10</b> which is closer to the user, while the term âdistalâ will refer to the end which is further from the user. It should be noted that with respect to the end effector assembly <b>100</b>, reference to proximal end and distal end will be with respect to configuration of the end effector assembly <b>100</b> following attachment to the distal end <b>14</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> and corresponding actual use via the endoscopic bipolar forceps <b>10</b> during the surgical procedure, as opposed to the position of the end effector assembly <b>100</b> during the attachment process.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a tissue sealing system <b>3</b> having a combination forceps and in vivo detachable end effector assembly <b>5</b> according to the present disclosure is shown. The combination forceps and in vivo detachable end effector assembly <b>5</b> includes a forceps <b>10</b> coupled to a generator <b>20</b>. Upon attachment and engagement of end effector assembly <b>100</b>, as described in more detail below, the combination forceps and in vivo detachable end effector assembly <b>5</b> is adapted to seal tissue using electrosurgical energy. The generator <b>20</b> may be configured to output various types of electrosurgical energy (e.g., from about 300 MHz to about 10,000 MHz).</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The forceps <b>10</b> is coupled to the generator <b>20</b> via a cable <b>11</b> adapted to transmit energy and control signals therebetween. Various embodiments of the forceps <b>10</b> utilizing the aforementioned types of energy are discussed in more detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">As indicated, the forceps <b>10</b> is configured to support an in vivo detachable end effector assembly <b>100</b>. Forceps <b>10</b> typically includes various conventional features (e.g., a housing <b>60</b>, a handle assembly <b>75</b>, a rotating assembly <b>80</b>, a trigger assembly <b>70</b>) which enable forceps <b>10</b> and detachable end effector assembly <b>100</b> to mutually cooperate to grasp, seal and, if warranted, divide tissue. Forceps <b>10</b> generally includes housing <b>60</b> and handle assembly <b>75</b>, which includes moveable handle <b>62</b> and handle <b>72</b> that is integral with housing <b>60</b>. Handle <b>62</b> is moveable relative to handle <b>72</b> to actuate detachable end effector assembly <b>100</b> to grasp and treat tissue. Forceps <b>10</b> also includes a shaft <b>12</b> that has distal end <b>14</b> that mechanically engages detachable end effector assembly <b>100</b> and proximal end <b>16</b> that mechanically engages housing <b>60</b> proximate rotating assembly <b>80</b> disposed at the distal end of housing <b>60</b>. Rotating assembly <b>80</b> is mechanically associated with shaft <b>12</b>. Movement of rotating assembly <b>80</b> imparts similar rotational movement to shaft <b>12</b> which, in turn, rotates detachable end effector assembly <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Referring also to <figref>FIGS. 3A-3B</figref>, detachable end effector assembly <b>100</b> includes a proximal end <b>1250</b> comprising a shaft <b>1201</b> at proximal end <b>1250</b> that is configured to engage distal end <b>14</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> of the forceps <b>10</b> at interface joint <b>140</b>. The engagement between the shaft <b>12</b> and the shaft <b>1201</b> at interface joint <b>140</b> enables the attachment and detachment of the end effector assembly <b>100</b> with the forceps <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Detachable end effector assembly <b>100</b> also includes two jaw members <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> having proximal ends <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> and distal ends <b>114</b>, <b>124</b>. Jaw members <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> are pivotable about a post or pivot pin <b>95</b> and are movable from a first position wherein jaw members <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> are spaced relative to another, to a second position wherein jaw members <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> are closed and cooperate to grasp tissue therebetween. As discussed in more detail below, the detachable end effector assembly <b>100</b> may be adapted for use with various energy sources.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In the illustrated embodiment, the shaft <b>12</b> houses a pushrod <b>101</b> that is operatively coupled to the movable handle <b>62</b> such that when the handle <b>62</b> is moved relative to the handle <b>72</b> the pushrod <b>101</b> moves longitudinally, either proximally or distally within the shaft <b>12</b>. The pushrod <b>101</b> may include one or more pins disposed at the distal end <b>16</b> of shaft <b>12</b>. Each of the jaw members <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> includes a corresponding slot disposed at the proximal ends thereof that mechanically cooperates with the push pins in a cam-follower mechanical arrangement. Motion of the pushrod <b>101</b> causes the pins to slide within respective slots <b>105</b> to actuate the jaw members. Other ways of opening/closing the jaws <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> are contemplated such as any known combinations of mechanical or electro-mechanical arrangement of gears, cams, pulleys, springs and sleeves.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The forceps <b>10</b> may also include a trigger assembly <b>70</b> that advances a knife <b>190</b> disposed within the detachable end effector assembly <b>100</b>. Once a tissue seal is formed, the user activates the trigger assembly <b>70</b> to separate the tissue along the tissue seal.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Each jaw member <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> also includes a sealing surface <b>112</b> and <b>122</b>, respectively, disposed on an inner-facing surface thereof. Sealing surfaces <b>112</b> and <b>122</b> cooperate to seal tissue held therebetween upon the application of energy. Sealing surfaces <b>112</b> and <b>122</b> are connected to generator <b>20</b> that communicates energy through the tissue held therebetween.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">As best seen in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, forceps <b>10</b> also includes an electrosurgical cable <b>11</b> which connects the forceps <b>10</b> to generator <b>20</b>. Cable <b>11</b> is internally divided into cable leads (not shown) which each transmit electrosurgical energy through their respective feed paths through the forceps <b>10</b> to the detachable end effector assembly <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">As mentioned above, detachable end effector assembly <b>100</b> is attached at the distal end <b>14</b> of shaft <b>12</b> and includes a pair of opposing jaw members <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. As described above, movable handles <b>62</b> and <b>72</b> mechanically cooperate to impart movement of the jaw members <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> from an open position, wherein the jaw members <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> are disposed in spaced relation relative to one another, to a clamping or closed position wherein the jaw members <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> cooperate to grasp tissue therebetween.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As shown best in <figref>FIGS. 3A-3B</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, the detachable end effector assembly <b>100</b> is designed as a bilateral assembly, i.e., both jaw members <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> pivot relative to one another about a pivot pin <b>95</b> disposed therethrough. The jaw members <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> are curved to facilitate manipulation of tissue and to provide better âline of sightâ for accessing organs and large tissue structures. In other embodiments, the jaw members <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> may have a straight configuration.</p>
