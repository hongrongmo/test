      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0018">Pain is defined as unpleasant sensory or emotional experience resulting from the damage of body tissue according to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), which is characterized as two types: acute pain or chronic pain. Pain decreases normally within 1 to 3 months after the removal of injured tissue and the application of the proper medicine, and is classified as acute pain, such as the pain caused by appendicitis. On the contrary, if the duration of the pain is longer than that of expectant recovery or the pain itself becomes a sickness, the pain is classified as chronic pain. Chronic pain, such as long-term pain contributed to by cancer, usually continues for more than six months. Therefore, patients suffering from this pain need suitable therapies to alleviate their symptoms.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0019">Clinically speaking, pain in organisms may be inflammatory pain which results from tissue inflammation, nociceptive pain which is the pain caused by direct noxious stimulation of the receptors on pain-related nerves, neuropathic pain resulting from dysfunction or damage of the central or peripheral nervous system caused by injury or diseases.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0020">Pain is characterized by the hypersensitivity of the injured area and the surrounding normal tissue. Morphine-like drugs are usually effective on pain for a limited period; however, neuropathic pain can be long-lasting even after the recovery from the events that caused it, e.g. âphantom painâ after amputation. Chronic pain syndrome can be induced by any form of injury, including surgery, oppressive injury, trauma, pathogenic factors, poison, abnormal inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, such as diabetes and ischemia.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0021">Unfortunately, the adaptive therapeutic drugs to alleviate chronic neuropathic pain such as anti-melancholia tricyclic medicine, anti-invasion drugs and local anesthetics only ease the pain temporally or achieve different levels of relief. Moreover, the current therapies typically have severe side effects, for example, change of cognition, sedation, nausea, or narcotic addiction. Therefore, a novel method to alleviate chronic pain over the long term is still needed.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0022">The term âorganismâ as utilized herein includes humans, dogs, cats, cows, pigs, sheep, horses and other mammals. The term âpainâ as utilized herein generally includes chronic pain, acute pain and pain which is based on inflammation or neuropathy in different tissues. The term âadministrationâ as utilized herein means alleviating the pain of an organism by giving a compound or a pharmaceutical composition to the organism. The administration includes, but is not limited to, oral administration and injection. In further Embodiments, the naphtho[2,3-f]quinoxaline compounds are administered by intraplantar, intrathecal, or intraperitoneal injection.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0023">The term âinflammationâ as utilized herein, can be characterized into two types: acute inflammation and chronic inflammation. When tissue is injured, bleeding or infected by pathogens, a physiological response will be aroused due to the release of proinflammatory cytokine, such as histamine, prostaglandin, interleukin, TNF-Î±, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³). Prolonged inflammation may lead to a variety of diseases, for example, rheumatoid arthritis or cancer.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0024">The term âalleviate painâ as utilized herein, generally refers to the relief of any type of pain, wherein the pain includes, but is not limited to, neuropathic pain such as the pain caused by diabetes, visceral pain, post-operative pain, pain caused by cancer or treatments of cancer, and inflammatory pain caused by arthritis or irritable bowel syndrome, headache and muscle pain.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0025">Nociceptive Painâthe Animal Model of Acute Pain Induced Using an Acid Solution to Evaluate the Analgesic Effect of the Compound</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0026">Naphtho[2,3-f]quinoxaline-7,12-dione compound was intraplantarly injected into the right hind paws of 8 to 12-week-old CD-1 mice. 5 minutes after the injection, 25 Î¼L of pH 5.0 acid solution was intraplantarly injected into each of the mice. About 60 minutes later, the mice were directly tested with the hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli using von Frey filaments (Touch-Test North Coast Medical, Inc., Margan Hill, Calif.). The control group was conducted under the same conditions except it was treated with a compound-free saline. The results are shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, where the injection of 25 Î¼L of the pH 5.0 acid solution induced mechanical hyperalgeisa in the right hind paw of the mice, and the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) of these mice was 1.1Â±0.065 g. By injecting 2.2 Î¼g/kg of the naphtho[2,3-f]quinoxaline-7,12-dione (NSC745887, D1) compound intraplantarly into the right hind paws of the mice, the paw withdrawal threshold of those mice recovered to 4.0Â±0 g (PWT of control group mice was 4.0Â±0 g). Therefore, 2.2 Î¼g/kg of the naphtho[2,3-f]quinoxaline-7,12-dione (NSC745887, D1) compound effectively inhibited the acute pain caused by the acid solution. The sole injection of the compound without the acid solution into the mice did not induce pain; the paw withdrawal threshold of the mice was still 4.0Â±0 g, which indicates that the compound did not arouse a pain response.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0027">Some of the mice were intraplantarly injected with 2.4 or 24 Î¼g/kg of the compound C3 (NSC745886) into the right hind paws, which was followed by the injection of the pH 5.0 acid solution inducing mechanical hyperalgeisa in the same manner. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>, when the dosage reached 24 Î¼g/kg, the PWT of these mice recovered to 2.0Â±0 g (PWT of control group mice was 4.0Â±0 g), showing that 24 Î¼g/kg of the compound C3 (NSC745886) can reduce the acute pain induced by acid solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0028">Some of the mice were intraplantarly injected with 2.43 or 24.3 Î¼g/kg of the compound D2 (NSC745888) into the right hind paws, which was followed by the injection of the pH 5.0 acid solution inducing mechanical hyperalgeisa in the same manner. According to the <figref>FIG. 1C</figref>, when the dosage reached 24.3 Î¼g/kg, the PWT of these mice recovered to 4.0Â±0 g (PWT of control group mice was 4.0Â±0 g), showing that 24.3 Î¼g/kg of the compound D2 (NSC745888) can alleviate the acute pain induced by acid solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0029">The effective dosage of the compound D1 (2.2 Î¼g/kg) is less than that of the compound C3 (24 Î¼g/kg) and the compound D2 (24.3 Î¼g/kg). Furthermore, while using the same dosage of the compound D2 and the compound C3 (24 Î¼g/kg), the compound D2 can inhibit the pain completely (the PWT of the mice administered the compound D2 recovered to 4.0Â±0 g). That is, the D2 compound is more effective than the C3 compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0030">Neuropathic Painâthe Animal Model of Chronic Neuropathic Pain Induced by Chronic Constriction Injury (CCI) of the Sciatic Nerve to Evaluate the Analgesic Effect of the Compound</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0031">The assessment of the effectiveness of the compound for alleviating neuropathic pain used the animal model of chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve, which was established by Bennett and Xie (1988). After the surgery, the mice developed long-lasting hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli (chronic mechanical hyperalgesia), even being lightly touched. The mechanical hyperalgesia test was used to evaluate the analgesic effect of the compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0032">The mice, after a week following the surgery, were intraplantarly injected with a series of different dosages of the naphtho[2,3-f]quinoxaline-7,12-dione compound, 0.22, 2.2, 22 Î¼g/kg, or the mice were injected with 2.2 Î¼g/kg of compound intrathecally, or with 43 Î¼g/kg of the compound intraperitoneally. The hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli was measured using von Frey filaments at 60 minutes after the injection. The mice injected with saline following surgery were the control group and the other mice injected with gabapentin following surgery were the positive control group.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0033">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) of the mice after a week following the surgery decreased to 0.9Â±0.23 g but that of the mice that were intraplantarly administered with 2.2 Î¼g/kg of the D1 (NSC745887) compound recovered to 3.3Â±0.67 g (that of the control group following surgery was 3.6Â±0.29 g). The result indicates that the compound effectively alleviates the chronic mechanical hyperalgesia caused by CCI of the sciatic nerve. When the dosage was increased to 22 Î¼g/kg, the paw withdrawal threshold remained 3.3Â±0.67 g. The same dosage of 2.2 Î¼g/kg was injected intrathecally into mice and reduced the mechanical hyperalgesia (PWT was 2.0 g), though it did not completely inhibit hyperalgesia.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0034">The intraperitoneal injection of 43 Î¼g/kg of the compound also completely inhibited mechanical hyperalgesia induced by CCI of the sciatic nerve. By contrast, the current therapeutic medicine for alleviating neuropathic pain is gabapentin, and at least 15,000 Î¼g/kg is required for intraperitoneal injection to inhibit the chronic mechanical hyperalgesia caused by CCI of the sciatic nerve. The effective dosage of naphtho[2,3-f]quinoxaline compounds for inhibiting neuropathic pain is substantially less than that of gabapentin. In addition, it was also proven that the effective dosage required for intraplantar injection was lower than that for intrathecal or intraperitoneal injection.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0035">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2B</figref>, the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) of the mice after a week following the surgery decreased to 0.9Â±0.23 g but that of the mice that were intraplantarly administered with 2.2 Î¼g/kg of the compound D1 (NSC745887) or 24.3 Î¼g/kg of the D2 (NSC745888) compound recovered to 2.0Â±0 g, which was the same as that of the control group following surgery. Injecting 24 Î¼g/kg of the C3 (NSC745886) compound into the mice may ease the pain caused by CCI of the sciatic nerve, however, it did not completely alleviate the pain (the PWT of the mice recovered to 1.4 g). This result indicates that the effective dosage of the compound D1 is less than that of D2 and C3.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0036">As shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the mice that had CCI of the sciatic nerve were intraplantarly injected with 2.2 Î¼g/kg of the naphtho[2,3-f]quinoxaline-7,12-dione compound once every week for three weeks. The PWT in the first week was 3.3Â±0.67 g, the second week was 3.3Â±0.67 g and the third week was 3.0Â±0.1 g, and the data shows that there was no obvious indication that the mice developed tolerance to the compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0037">Inflammatory Painâthe Chronic Inflammatory Pain Induced by Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0038">When 50% CFA was intraplantarly injected into the mouse, paw edema and chronic mechanical hyperalgesia were developed in the tested mice. Different dosages of the naphtho[2,3-f]quinoxaline-7,12-dione compound, 0.22, 2.2, 22 Î¼g/kg were intraplantarly injected into mouse hindpaw, followed by 50% CFA injection. At 60 minutes after the CFA injection, the hypersensitivity of the mice to mechanical stimuli was measured using von Frey filaments.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0039">As shown in <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>, the PWT of the mice injected with CFA decreased to 0.4Â±0.033 g. However, the PWT of the mice injected with 2.2 Î¼g/kg of the compound D1 recovered to 1.1Â±0.15 g, and the PWT recovered to 2.0Â±0.411 g following a intraplantar injection of 22 Î¼g/kg of the compound D1, which indicates that the dosage of the compound D1 was sufficient to ease the chronic inflammatory pain (compared with control PWT 3.8Â±0.171 g). The results show that the compound had the effect of alleviating inflammatory pain caused by CFA.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0040">As shown in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, the PWT of the mice injected with 22 Î¼g/kg of the compound D1 recovered to 2.3 g (compared with control PWT 3.8Â±0.171 g), and the PWT recovered to 1.4 g or 1.0 g following an intraplantar injection of 24 Î¼g/kg of the compound C3 or 24.3 Î¼g/kg of the compound D2, respectively. The results show that the trend of the effective dosages of these compounds is D1&lt;C3&lt;D2.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0041">In accordance with the results above, the naphtho[2,3-f]quinoxaline compound and its pharmaceutical composition actively alleviated pain in organisms and the results also show how to choose therapeutically effective amounts of the compound as well as different administration methods for specific subjects. The pain can be any types of pain including, but not limited to, neuropathic pain (such as the pain caused by diabetes), visceral pain, pain after surgery, pain caused by cancer or treatments of cancer, headache, muscle pain, and inflammatory pain caused by arthritis or irritable bowel syndrome.</p>

      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0047">25 Î¼L of acid solution with a pH of 5.0 was injected into 8 to 12-week-old CD-1 mice in order to induce mechanical hyperalgesia. Mice injected with saline were the control group; the ones that were injected with compound only were compound group; the ones that were injected with only the acid solution were the acid group and those injected with both compound and the acid solution were the acid+compound group.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0048">The above-mentioned 1 M of pH 5.0 solution was prepared by dissolving 1.952 g of 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) in 10 mL of sterilized secondary water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 5.0 using 1N NaOH solution. Before injection, pH5.0 was diluted with saline into 10 mM.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0049">2.2 Î¼g/kg of the compound was administered to the mice by intraplantar injection about 5 minutes prior to the injection of the acid solution. An hour after the injection of the acid, the hypersensitivity of the mice to mechanical stimuli was measured using von Frey filaments (Touch-Test North Coast Medical, Inc., Margan Hill, Calif.). The mice were placed in transparent plastic chambers (10Ã8Ã10 cm) on a metal mesh floor at least 30 minutes per day for 2 days to acclimatize them to the testing room prior to the test. 60 minutes after the mice were administered with the compound, the mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed through the measurement of paw withdrawal frequencies by a sequential series of von Frey filaments of weights 0.6, 1.0, 1.4, 2.0 and 4.0 g applied perpendicularly to the plantar surface of the paw. The paw was briefly stimulated with force sufficient to slightly bend the filaments and a single trial consisted of repeated applications of the von Frey filaments five times, each application lasting for about 5 seconds. The occurrence of paw withdrawal resulting from the stimulation or removing the stimulation for each trial was quantified as a percentage response frequency for each filament. When the frequency was more than 50%, the weight of the von Frey filaments was determined as the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT). To make sure all the mice were under normal physical conditions, all housing conditions complied with general feeding standards, and the temperature and illumination were maintained in a suitable range.</p>

To anesthetize the mice, each of the mice was injected with 240 mg/kg of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (Avertin). Then three ligatures were loosely tied around the sciatic nerve of the mouse with chromic gut. The surgical procedure for the Sham (non ligation) control group was identical to that mentioned above except that the sciatic nerves were not ligated. A week after the mice in the experimental (CCI+compound) group had chronic constriction injury of sciatic nerves, the compound was intraplantarly, intrathecally, or intraperitoneally injected into the mice. 60 minutes after the injection, the mice were directly subjected to the hypersensitivity test to mechanical stimuli. The mice under the surgery treated with saline were the CCI group; the mice treated with gabapentin were the positive control (CCI+Gabapentin) group.</p>
