  <abstract id="abstr_eng" date-changed="20150903" lang="eng" format="original">
    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">A liquid extraction cleaning device comprises a vacuum pump, a liquid pump, a cleaning solution tank, a recovery tank, first and second spray nozzles, a spray selection switch, a vacuum inlet port, an agitator assembly, and a handle. The spray selection switch controls whether liquid is expelled from the second spray nozzle when liquid is expelled from the first spray nozzle. The agitator assembly comprises first and second agitators. The first agitator is configured to rotate. The second agitator is configured to reciprocate. The handle is pivotally connected to the rest of the liquid extraction cleaning device and is lockable in several pivotal orientations. The handle can also be pivoted forward from a rearwardly extending direction to an extent that it extends forward horizontally.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The present invention pertains to liquid extraction cleaning devices of the type that spray cleaning liquid onto surfaces and thereafter suck the liquid back up to clean such surfaces. More specifically, the present invention pertains to liquid extraction cleaning devices that are used to clean carpet or upholstery and that store the cleaning solution and recovered liquid onboard.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">2. General Background</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Some carpet and upholstery extraction cleaners are known in the industry as floor cleaners and some are known as spot cleaners.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">A typical floor cleaner comprises a wheeled main unit that rests on the floor and comprises one or more liquid spray nozzles, one or more agitators, and one or more vacuum intake nozzles beneath the main unit. As the main unit of such a floor cleaner is dragged over carpet, liquid spray is discharged from the main unit. The agitator of the main unit is then used to work the liquid into the carpet. Following the agitation, the vacuum intake nozzles of the main unit extract as much of the soiled liquid from the carpet as possible. It is common for floor cleaners to be configured to perform all of these actions simultaneously, albeit on different portions of the carpet. Thus, as the main unit is dragged or self-propelled over carpet, the spraying, agitating, and vacuuming occurs sequentially on any given portion of the carpet.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Spot cleaners tend to be smaller than floor cleaners and are typically used to pick up spills, remove localized stains, or clean furniture upholstery. Some spot cleaners are merely handheld devices that comprise the same general features of the larger floor cleaners, but without the wheels. Other spot cleaners comprise a hand tool that is attached to a main unit via a flexible hose. With such hand tool spot cleaners, the hand tool performs the spraying and the vacuuming and may or may not perform agitation. The vacuum motor and most other necessary components of such hand tool spot cleaners are contained in the main unit. Many floor cleaners are provided with an accessory hand tool and hose that allow the floor cleaners to also serve as spot cleaners.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The present invention is directed primarily to floor cleaner liquid extraction devices.</p>

      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">A preferred embodiment of a liquid extraction cleaning device in accordance with the invention is shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>. The extraction cleaner <b>10</b> comprises a main unit <b>12</b>, a cleaning solution tank assembly <b>14</b>, a recovery tank assembly <b>16</b>, a handle <b>18</b>, and accessories <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The main unit <b>12</b> comprises a vacuum pump <b>22</b>, a liquid pump <b>24</b>, an agitator assembly <b>26</b>, a primary spray nozzle <b>28</b>, and preferably a secondary spray nozzle <b>30</b>, an accessory tool liquid port <b>32</b>, a spray selection switch <b>34</b>, and a vacuum inlet port <b>36</b>, and a lifting handle <b>37</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The vacuum pump <b>22</b> is operatively connected to the recovery tank assembly <b>16</b> in a manner such that the vacuum pump can draw air from the recovery tank. The recovery tank assembly <b>16</b> is operatively connected to the vacuum inlet port <b>36</b> in a manner such that the vacuum inlet port draws in air and/or liquid when air is drawn from the recovery tank assembly by the vacuum pump <b>22</b>. The liquid pump <b>24</b> is operatively connected to the solution tank assembly <b>14</b> for drawing liquid therefrom, and is operatively connected to the primary spray nozzle <b>28</b>, the secondary spray nozzle <b>30</b>, and the accessory tool liquid port <b>32</b> to supply pressurized liquid thereto. The spray selection switch <b>34</b> is operatively connected to the liquid pump <b>24</b> and preferably is a hand operated mechanical fluid valve that has three settings for channeling the liquid from the liquid pump. In one setting, the spray selection switch <b>34</b> allows liquid to travel from the liquid pump <b>24</b> to the primary spray nozzle <b>28</b>, while preventing liquid from traveling from the liquid pump to the secondary spray nozzle <b>30</b> and/or accessory tool liquid port <b>32</b>. In another setting, the spray selection switch <b>34</b> allows liquid to travel from the liquid pump <b>24</b> to the primary spray nozzle <b>28</b> and the secondary spray nozzle <b>30</b>, while preventing liquid from traveling from the liquid pump to the accessory tool liquid port <b>32</b>. In the third setting, the spray selection switch <b>34</b> allows liquid to travel from the liquid pump <b>24</b> to the accessory tool liquid port <b>32</b>, while preventing liquid from traveling from the liquid pump to the primary spray nozzle <b>28</b> and/or the secondary spray nozzle <b>30</b>. It should be appreciated however that this functionality could alternatively be carried out via electrical valves or a combination of electrical and mechanical valves.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The agitator assembly <b>26</b> of the main unit <b>12</b> comprises a housing <b>38</b>, a rotational agitator <b>40</b>, a reciprocating agitator <b>42</b>, an electric motor <b>44</b>, and a pair of fixed side brushes <b>46</b>. The rotational agitator <b>40</b> comprises a plurality of bristles <b>48</b> (some of which are omitted in the drawing figures) that extend from bristle holes <b>50</b> formed in a roller <b>52</b>. The reciprocating agitator <b>42</b> is preferably configured to pivotally reciprocate and comprises brush bar <b>54</b> (also comprising bristles <b>48</b>) that pivotally reciprocates about an axis that is parallel to the rotational axis of the rotational agitator <b>40</b>. The axis about which the reciprocating agitator <b>42</b> pivots is preferably fixed relative to the housing <b>38</b>. In contrast, the axis about which the rotational agitator <b>40</b> revolves preferably is able to pivot up or down (parallel to the ground) about an axis defined by the motor housing <b>56</b> that surrounds the electric motor <b>44</b>. As shown most clearly in <figref>FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the motor housing <b>56</b> comprises an axle portion <b>58</b> that is free to pivot within a channel formed partially by the housing <b>38</b> and partially by the adjacent portion of the bottom of the main unit <b>12</b> of the liquid extraction cleaning device <b>10</b>. Rigid arms <b>60</b> fixed to the motor housing <b>56</b> extend from the motor housing and connect to the opposite ends of the rotational agitator <b>40</b>. Thus, motor housing <b>56</b> and the rotational agitator <b>40</b> pivot together about the axis of the axle portion <b>58</b> of the motor housing relative to the housing <b>38</b> of the agitator assembly <b>26</b>. As such, only the force of gravity acting on the motor housing <b>56</b> and the rotational agitator <b>40</b> forces the rotational agitator downward against a floor (the weight of the electric motor <b>44</b> does not influence that force since the center of mass of the motor is aligned with the axle portion <b>58</b> of the motor housing). The electric motor <b>44</b> preferably drives the rotation of the rotational agitator <b>40</b> via a drive belt (not shown) located in one of the arms <b>60</b>. A linking member <b>62</b> preferably connects an off-axis portion <b>64</b> adjacent to an end of the rotational agitator <b>40</b> to a pivot arm <b>66</b> of the reciprocating agitator <b>42</b>. The linking member <b>62</b> thereby transforms rotational movement of the rotational agitator <b>40</b> into pivotal reciprocation of the reciprocating agitator <b>42</b>. The fixed side brushes <b>46</b> of the agitator assembly <b>26</b> are mounted to the bottom of the housing <b>38</b> on opposite sides of the rotational agitator <b>40</b>. Thus, the fixed side brushes <b>46</b> move only with the main unit <b>12</b> of the liquid extractor <b>10</b>. The front of the housing <b>38</b> of the agitator assembly <b>26</b> also forms a part of the vacuum inlet port <b>36</b>, with the other portion being formed by a piece of translucent material <b>68</b> in a manner such that liquid drawn into the vacuum inlet port can easily be observed. The housing <b>38</b> also supports the primary spray nozzle <b>28</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">As shown below in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the vacuum inlet port <b>36</b> is preferably located adjacent the front on the bottom of the main unit <b>12</b> and the rotational agitator <b>40</b> lies behind the vacuum inlet port <b>36</b> and between the vacuum inlet port and the reciprocating agitator <b>42</b>. The primary spray nozzle <b>28</b> is preferably located immediately aft of the reciprocating agitator <b>42</b> and is configured to spray liquid downward in a fan-like pattern. In contrast, the secondary spray nozzle <b>30</b> is positioned on the rear of the liquid extraction cleaning device <b>10</b> and is preferably at least three times as far behind the vacuum inlet port as compared to the primary spray nozzle <b>28</b>. It should be appreciate that, in operation, liquid extraction cleaning device <b>10</b> is preferably pulled rather than pushed. Thus, carpet is first wetted by the primary spray nozzle <b>28</b> or by the primary and secondary spray nozzles <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> prior to being agitated, and liquid extraction via the vacuum inlet port <b>36</b> occurs after agitation. By positioning the secondary spray nozzle <b>30</b> much further behind the vacuum inlet <b>36</b> port as compared to the primary spray nozzle <b>28</b>, the liquid sprayed from the secondary spray nozzle has a much longer dwell time on/in the carpet than does the liquid sprayed from the primary spray nozzle. Thus, operation of the secondary spray nozzle <b>30</b> not only increases the amount of liquid per area sprayed during a given pass of the liquid extraction cleaning device <b>10</b>, but also increases the penetration time in which the liquid can penetrate the carpet. It should therefore be appreciated that the secondary spray nozzle <b>30</b> is typically only used during an initial cleaning pass or when deep liquid penetration is desired. The lifting handle <b>37</b> Is preferably positioned above the center of gravity of the liquid extraction cleaning device <b>10</b> and is configured to support the weight of the entire liquid extraction cleaning device.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">A pair of wheels <b>70</b> are preferably attached to the main unit <b>12</b> on opposite sides thereof and adjacent the rear of the liquid extraction cleaning device <b>10</b>. The wheels <b>70</b> not only make it easier to pull the liquid extraction cleaning device <b>10</b> over carpet during operation, but also allow users to tilt the main unit <b>12</b> about the wheels and thereby push the liquid extraction cleaning device.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The handle <b>18</b> of the liquid extraction cleaning device <b>10</b> is preferably pivotally connected to the upper rear edge of the main unit <b>12</b>. The handle preferably comprises a locking mechanism <b>72</b>, an electrical input port <b>74</b>, a main power switch <b>76</b>, a liquid pump switch <b>78</b>, and power cord wrap posts <b>80</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, the locking mechanism preferably comprises an internal linking member <b>82</b> connecting an external release member <b>84</b> to internal locking pins <b>86</b>. The locking pins <b>86</b> cooperate with notched members <b>88</b> that are fixed relative to the main unit <b>12</b> of the liquid extraction cleaning device <b>10</b> in a manner such that the locking mechanism <b>72</b> can fix the pivotal orientation of the handle <b>18</b> relative to the main unit in any of a plurality of angles. The linking member <b>82</b> is preferably biased toward the notched members <b>88</b> via a spring <b>90</b> such that the locking mechanism <b>72</b> only allows the handle <b>18</b> to pivot relative to the main unit <b>12</b> when the release member <b>84</b> is pulled away from the base of the handle. Preferably, the handle <b>18</b> can be pivoted forward relative to the main unit <b>12</b> to such a degree that the handle is horizontal or even tilts downward a bit. As shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, with the handle <b>18</b> tilted forward, the entire liquid extraction cleaning device <b>10</b> can be tilted on its back such that minimal floor space is required to stow the liquid extraction cleaning device. The electrical input port <b>74</b> on the handle <b>18</b> merely is a port for receiving the power supply cord (not shown) of the liquid extraction cleaning device <b>10</b> and the power cord wrap posts <b>80</b> are merely conventional posts for wrapping and storing the power cord when the extraction cleaning device is not in use. The main power switch <b>76</b> of the handle <b>18</b> is preferably an electrical three-way toggle switch that is capable of shutting off all power to the liquid extraction cleaning device <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the main power switch <b>76</b> can be toggled to activate the vacuum pump <b>22</b> or the vacuum pump and, simultaneously, the electric motor <b>44</b> of agitator assembly <b>26</b>. In either of such later alternatives, the liquid pump <b>24</b> can also be activated by depressing the liquid pump switch <b>78</b> of the handle <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The cleaning solution tank assembly <b>14</b> comprises a tank portion <b>92</b>, a fill cap <b>94</b>, and a handle <b>96</b>. Like with typical liquid extraction cleaning devices, the tank portion <b>92</b> is operatively connected to the liquid pump <b>24</b> when the tank portion is in position on the main unit <b>12</b>. To refill the cleaning solution tank assembly <b>14</b> with cleaning solution (which should be understood to include water by itself too), a person can lift up on the handle <b>96</b>. The handle <b>96</b> is preferably pivotally connected to the tank portion <b>92</b> such that the handle pivots upward when relative to the tank portion when lifted. This makes it easier to hold and lift the entire cleaning solution tank assembly <b>14</b> from the main unit <b>12</b>. The fill cap <b>94</b> is preferably threadably attached to the tank portion <b>92</b> and is threadably removed to refill the tank. The fill cap <b>94</b> also preferably serves as a measuring cup for diluting concentrated cleaning solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The recovery tank assembly <b>16</b> comprises a tank portion <b>98</b>, a drain cap <b>100</b>, a handle <b>102</b>, and an intake duct <b>104</b>. Like typical recovery tanks, the tank portion <b>98</b> is configured to collect liquid extracted through the vacuum inlet port <b>36</b> of the main unit <b>12</b> as air is drawn out of the tank portion <b>98</b> via the vacuum pump <b>22</b>. The front wall of the tank portion <b>98</b> comprises the opening <b>106</b> through which an air and liquid mixture enters the tank. The drain cap <b>100</b> is preferably threadably attached to a drain port of the tank portion <b>98</b> and can be threadably removed therefrom to drain the tank. The intake duct <b>104</b> surrounds an intake passageway. The intake duct <b>104</b> comprises a lower catch <b>108</b> and an upper discharge tube <b>110</b>. The discharge tube <b>110</b> surrounds a portion of the intake passageway and comprises a releasable locking tab <b>112</b> that cooperates with the lower catch <b>108</b> to releasably attach the intake duct <b>104</b> to the tank portion <b>98</b> of the recovery tank assembly <b>16</b>. More specifically, the intake duct <b>104</b> is attached to the tank portion <b>98</b> by first hooking the lower catch <b>108</b> over a lip at the bottom of the front wall of the tank portion <b>98</b>, and thereafter pivoting the intake duct upward about the lower catch such that the discharge tube <b>110</b> extends through the opening <b>106</b> of the tank portion <b>98</b> and the locking tab <b>112</b> clicks. Once the locking tab <b>112</b> clicks, the locking tab prevents the intake duct <b>104</b> from separating from the tank portion <b>98</b> unless the locking tab is manually deflected by reaching into the tank from the drain port of the tank portion <b>98</b>. The front wall of the intake duct <b>104</b> preferably comprises an accessory tool vacuum inlet port <b>114</b> that is selectively covered by a pliable flap <b>116</b>. When the flap <b>116</b> is bent down, the accessory tool vacuum inlet port <b>114</b> is configured to receive the downstream end of an accessory tool hose as described below. When the flap <b>116</b> is up and is covering the accessory tool vacuum inlet port <b>114</b>, the intake duct <b>104</b> operatively connects the vacuum inlet port <b>36</b> to the interior of the tank portion <b>98</b> of the recovery tank assembly <b>16</b>. Like with the cleaning solution tank assembly <b>14</b>, the handle <b>102</b> of the recovery tank assembly <b>16</b> is pivotally connected to the tank portion <b>98</b> of the recovery tank assembly to make it easier to hold and lift the entire recovery tank assembly <b>16</b> off of the main unit <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, one of the accessories <b>20</b> is a hand tool <b>118</b> that is attached to a flexible hose <b>120</b>. The hand tool <b>118</b> comprises a vacuum inlet port <b>122</b>, an agitator <b>124</b>, and spray nozzle <b>126</b>, and a grip portion <b>128</b>. The vacuum inlet port <b>122</b> and the grip portion <b>128</b> are configured such that air and liquid can be drawn in through the inlet port, pass through the grip portion, and then into the hose <b>120</b>. The agitator <b>124</b> is preferably a brush bar comprising bristles and is adjacent to the vacuum inlet port <b>122</b> and is preferably fixed relative to the grip portion. The spray nozzle <b>126</b> is adjacent to the agitator <b>124</b> opposite the vacuum inlet port <b>122</b> and is operatively connectable to the 24 liquid pump of the main unit <b>12</b> via flexible liquid tube <b>130</b>. The grip portion <b>128</b> preferably comprises a spray trigger <b>132</b> the operates a liquid valve (not shown) in a manner such that the liquid pump <b>24</b> can only force liquid out of the spray nozzle <b>126</b> when the spray trigger is depressed.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The downstream end of the hose <b>120</b> comprises a fitting <b>134</b>.
