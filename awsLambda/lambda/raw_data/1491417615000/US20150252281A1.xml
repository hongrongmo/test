      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a lubricating oil composition containing an ester having an epoxy structure in its molecule added to a lubricating base oil, especially to a lubricating oil composition with a greatly improved stability by adding an ester that is a fatty acid 3,4-epoxycyclohexylalkyl ester and/or a 3,4-epoxycyclohexyl carboxylic acid alkyl ester to capture acidic substances generated due to the deterioration of a lubricating oil or a mixed fluid of a lubricating oil and a refrigerant when used for a refrigerating equipment.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Mechanical systems such as industrial machineries, vehicles and refrigerating equipments have a variety of sliding parts such as various bearings, pistons, cylinders, gears and drive systems in which frictions are constantly repeated. If poor lubrications occur in these sliding parts, lubrication systems or mechanical systems including the same are no longer able to work as desired. Therefore, various lubricating oils are used as lubricants in the sliding parts depending on the operating environments and conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">High stability is required for these lubricating oils from the viewpoint of long-term reliability, but acidic substances are generated due to thermal and oxidative deterioration along with use of the lubricating oils. Since the generated acidic substances exerts a so-called autocatalytic effect, promoting further deterioration, the stability of the lubricants can be greatly increased by removing the acidic substances at an early stage.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In the field of refrigerating equipments, there are movements of transition from current hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants having a high global warming potential (GWP) to hydrofluoroolefin (FIFO) refrigerants having a 1/100 or less GWP, from the viewpoint of the prevention of global warming, and a wide range of investigations such as mixed refrigerants containing HFO is underway.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">However, since these HFO refrigerants have a low GWP, that is, are easily degradable, hydrofluoric acid (HF) that is a strong acid is therefore generated when degraded in the co-presence of lubricating oils in a refrigeration cycle, and promotes the further deterioration of the lubricating oils and refrigerants, or may cause corrosive wear in some cases to become the cause of system troubles. Thus, it is a major object to increase the stability of a mixed fluid of refrigerants and lubricating oils by effectively removing hydrofluoric acid and acidic substances generated due to the deterioration of lubricating oils.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Since dichlorodifluoromethane (R12) and hydrochlorodifluoromethane (R22) have been largely used as a conventional refrigerant in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems such as refrigerators, car air conditioners and room air conditioners and hydrochloric acid is generated when these refrigerants containing chlorine are mixed with lubricating oils of compressors and deteriorated after used for a long time, it is known to add phenyl glycidyl ether and alkylene oxide compounds which capture hydrochloric acid in the molecules to lubricating oils for compressors (refrigerating machine oils).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Thereafter, the stability of refrigerating machine oils has been attempted to be further improved; for example, Patent Literature 1 shows a refrigerating machine oil containing a glycidyl ether compound having two or more epoxy groups in the molecule; Patent Literature 2 proposes a lubricating oil wherein a phosphorus-based additive and a specific epoxy compound are added in combination therewith; and Patent Literature 3 proposes a refrigerating machine oil to which tricresyl phosphate and an epoxy constituted by glycidyl ether or a carbodiimide are added. Further, Patent Literature 4 shows a refrigerating machine oil containing an alicyclic polycarboxylic acid ester compound as a lubricating base oil, and additionally at least one of an epoxy compound selected from the group consisting of a glycidyl ester type epoxy compound and an alicyclic epoxy compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">However, these stabilizing agents have a purpose of capturing hydrochloric acid or suppressing the hydrolysis of an ester that is a lubricating base oil, and their effects are insufficient for a novel HFO refrigerant generating hydrofluoric acid that is a strong acid. Moreover, since organic materials such as plastics have come to be largely used in recent devices, for reductions in size and weight and higher efficiency, a stabilizing agent exhibiting a high effect even at a small amount thereof added is desired in order to reduce influences on these organic materials.</p>

      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0048">When using the lubricating oil composition of the present embodiment as a lubricating oil for general machineries or vehicles, a mineral oil-based base oil may be preferably used as the lubricating base oil. If conventional lubricating oils using a mineral oil-based base oil as the lubricating base oil are used in these applications, acidic substances such as carboxylic acids derived from the mineral oil-based base oil are generated in a large quantity due to the thermal and oxidative deterioration of the mineral oil-based base oil. When the content of additives is increased for suppressing the generation of the acidic substances, corrosion of the device and the like become problems. In contrast, according to the lubricating oil composition of the present embodiment, the effects of the specific ester additive are high even at a small content added, and therefore the stability can be greatly improved, and the corrosion can be reduced, without affecting the other properties of the lubricating oil.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0049">In the case of refrigerating equipment, as described herein above, there are movements of transition from current HFC refrigerant having a high GWP to a refrigerant having a low GWP such as HFO refrigerant, from the viewpoint of the prevention of global warming, and a lubricating oil suitably applied thereto is desired. The lubricating oil composition of the present embodiment is very useful also as a lubricating oil composition for a refrigerating machine used together with a low GWP refrigerant.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0050">Describing in more detail about the refrigerant, currently, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a, R134a) is widely used for refrigerators and car air-conditioners, and R410A which is a 1/1 mixed refrigerant of difluoro methane (HFC-32, R32) and pentafluoroethane (HFC-125, R125) is widely used for room air-conditioners. As the lubricating base oil of a lubricating oil for a refrigerating machine (a refrigerating machine oil) using these refrigerants, esters and polyethers, in particular, polyol esters, polyalkylene glycols and polyvinyl ethers having a moderate mutual solubility are suitable. However, use of these refrigerants is limited by so-called F-gas regulation, since their GWP is high.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0051">As an alternative, refrigerants including a refrigerant containing hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) which is an unsaturated hydrocarbon having a low GWP have been investigated, and they are promising candidates. Examples of the unsaturated hydrocarbon contain 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234yf), 1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234ze), and 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropene (HFO-1225ye). Since these HFO refrigerants have an easily degraded olefin structure in the molecule, they are characterized by a low stability, whereas they have a low GWP. Therefore, when they are deteriorated in the co-presence of a lubricating oil in a refrigeration cycle, hydrofluoric acid (HF) that is a strong acid is easily generated, and causes system problems by further promoting the deterioration of the refrigerant and lubricating oil and, in some cases, by corrosive wear.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0052">According to the lubricating oil composition of the present embodiment, such hydrofluoric acid and even also strong acidic substances generated due to the deterioration of lubricating oils can be effectively removed. In short, the high stability even in systems in which less stable refrigerants such as HFO and lubricating oils coexist can be maintained by the acidic substances being incorporated into the molecule of the above specific ester additive.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0053">That is, examples of a preferred embodiment of the lubricating oil composition of the present embodiment include a lubricating oil composition for a refrigerating machine used together with a refrigerant containing an unsaturated hydrofluorocarbon. Examples of a more preferred embodiment include an operating fluid composition for a refrigerating machine which contains the lubricating oil composition of the present embodiment and a refrigerant containing an unsaturated hydrofluorocarbon. The ârefrigerant containing an unsaturated hydrofluorocarbonâ used herein includes both of a refrigerant consisting of an unsaturated hydrofluorocarbon only (HFO alone), and a mixed refrigerant of an unsaturated hydrofluorocarbon and other refrigerant components.</p>

      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0078">As can be seen from Tables 1 and 2, the lubricating oil compositions of Examples 1 to 8 were small in the increase of the acid value, and not observed for precipitates, even in the thermal stability test at a high temperature in the co-presence of air, water and HFO-1234yf generating hydrofluoric acid. In the case of Examples 1 to 4 using the ester base oil and Example 8 using rapeseed oil, it is shown that hydrolysis was suppressed in the co-presence of water; and in the case of Examples 5 to 7 using the lubricating base oil which does not hydrolyze, it can be said that the oxidative deterioration was suppressed, since the test was in the co-presence of air and water.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0079">On the other hand, in all cases of the lubricating oil compositions of Comparative Examples 1 to 6, precipitates were observed, and the increase of the acid value was large. From these results, the lubricating oil composition of the present invention can achieve, in a small addition amount, the same effects as conventional additives, and can suppress the influence on the organic materials in the system. In addition, the stability is greatly improved when the addition amount is the same level as conventional additives.</p>

      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0080">The lubricating oil composition of the present invention can greatly improve, with the addition of a small amount of the additive, the stability by effectively capturing acidic substances generated due to thermal and oxidative deterioration along with use of lubricating oils in the case of oil pressure-operating oil and engine oils using mainly mineral oils as the lubricating base oil, or acidic substances including strong acids generated due to the thermal deterioration of mixed fluids of lubricating oils and refrigerants in the case of lubricating oils for a refrigerating machine using mainly oxygen-containing compounds as the lubricating base oil, and can be therefore suitably used for general machineries, vehicles refrigerating machines and the like.</p>
