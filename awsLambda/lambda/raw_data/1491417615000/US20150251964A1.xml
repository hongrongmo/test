      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of fertilizers. More specifically, the present invention relates to a fertilizer product that provides the early season âstarterâ or âpop-upâ benefits typically ascribed to phosphorus applications in situations where these traditional phosphorus applications are inappropriate because the soil already has adequate to excessive P. For example, growers are often forced to use traditional P applications when they already have high soil-P readings in order to get accelerated growth from the crop.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Starter fertilizer is defined as the small quantity of fertilizer nutrients applied in close proximity to the seed at planting by growers of crops. In some instances, the practice entails placing the fertilizer into the seed row directly with the seed, which is often referred to as a pop-up fertilizer. Growers of crops use starter fertilizers to enhance the development of emerging seedlings by supplying essential nutrients in accessible locations near the roots. This is especially important when crops are planted into cold, wet soils, particularly when there is minimum tillage of soil.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Nowhere in the literature have scientists defined a critical ratio or noted a specific synergy between P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, (phosphate) Zn and Mn when these elements are applied in concertâparticularly in finely divided particles. Work to date examines the three nutrients with respect to beneficial effects on plants pairwise or singly.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Phosphorus is immobile in the soil and consequently small seedling roots have difficulty obtaining the necessary amounts from the soil for rapid growth. For these reasons, additions of phosphorus fertilizer (often referred to as âstarter fertilizerâ) are routinely used to enhance early phosphorus uptake by crop seedlings, which in turn enhances early seedling growth or âpop-upâ. This application strategy is often used even when overall phosphorus levels in a field may be adequate or high. Usually, recommendations call for 35 kg of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>per hectare to accomplish this effect.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In certain situations, zinc may also be used as a component of a starter fertilizer. Like phosphorus, zinc is highly immobile in soil. In situations where soil tests indicate that zinc levels are inadequate or marginal, growers will use zinc as a component of a starter fertilizer as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Manganese is never commonly considered as a starter fertilizer and it is seldom used as a component of a starter fertilizer because among other reasons it is an immobile nutrient.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In no case does the literature refer to the benefits that would arise from using a combination of phosphorus/zinc/manganese as a coating on macronutrients, or as a starter fertilizer or pop-up fertilizer. Applicants have discovered a composition and method which mobilizes both zinc and manganese in the soil so that they can be used along with phosphorous in starter or pop up fertilizers. Such is accomplished by controlling the immediate environment around the composition including physical format, acidity conditions and composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Work at Brigham Young University in 2011 attempted to characterize the interaction between zinc and phosphorus fertilizer (but not manganese) and this work found that âwhen varying both P and Zn increasing Zn levels stimulated P uptake when ample P was present in the soilâbut this did not occur when P was deficient. (Brandt, A, B Hopkins, V Jolley, B Webb, B greenwood and J Buck, 2012<i>: âPhosphorus and zinc interactions and their relationships with other nutrients in maize grown in chelator buffered nutrient solution, J Plant Nutrition </i>35:1, 123-141).</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0032">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are now described. All publications mentioned hereunder are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0033">Research by the inventors has shown that manganese applied as a coating on NPK fertilizer aids in early season growth characteristics of crops by combatting root rot diseases that typically would slow down emergence (as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). Furthermore, combining manganese with P and Zn creates a heretofore unknown synergy in early plant growth and plant health.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0034">That is, while not wishing to be bound to a particular theory or hypothesis, the inventor believes that phosphate can induce zinc deficiency and that supplying a plant with phosphate only would induce a zinc deficiency in that plant, thereby reducing growth rate and growth efficiency. Similarly, zinc can induce a phosphate deficiency. Furthermore, manganese can substitute for magnesium in chlorophyll molecules. Consequently, manganese, zinc and phosphate are all required during early stages of growth and accordingly, supplying all three in synergistic amounts promotes improves plant growth, as discussed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0035">This patent relates to the discovery of a heretofore unknown synergy between three key nutrients when they are applied using three specific provisos: (a) they must be applied together in a homogeneous mix, (b) they must be applied in a specific range of ratios and (c) they must be applied as powders coated upon conventional granular or prilled fertilizer or alternatively, onto seed. The specific nutrients and ratios in powdered form coated onto macro fertilizers are Zn, P and Mn. When we applied these nutrients in using the three constraints outlined, outsized gains in plant growth were achieved beyond what would be expected from a simple additive effect in meeting plant nutritional needs.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0036">Furthermore, phosphate can induce zinc deficiency and that supplying a plant with phosphate only would induce a zinc deficiency in that plant, thereby reducing growth rate and growth efficiency. Similarly, zinc can induce a phosphate deficiency. Manganese can substitute for magnesium in chlorophyll molecules. Consequently, manganese, zinc and phosphate are all required during early stages of growth and accordingly, supplying all three in synergistic amounts promotes improved plant growth.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0037">Thus, the combination of (a) a root growth stimulation achieved with the powdered P along with (b) a disease protection facet from the powdered Mn and (c) a synergy from including a small amount of powdered Zinc leads to a level of plant growth that only typically would be seen using tens of pounds of phosphate fertilizers.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0038">According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a fertilizer product comprising: <ul id="ul-00009-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00010-en" list-style="none"><li>from about 1 part manganese;</li><li>from about 4 to about 6 parts phosphate; and</li><li>from about 2 to about 4 parts zinc.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0042">Preferably, the zinc, manganese and phosphate are of a particle size of at least through a 100 mesh, U.S. standard sieve.

      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0080">That is, the fertilizer product or coated agronomic product may be co-administered to the soil with planting of the seed or seedling and that while these may be stated as separate steps herein for ease of comprehension, co-administration is within the scope of the invention. Alternatively, the agronomic product may be a seed coated with the fertilizer product which is planted. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in this case, the seed and the fertilizer product are of course co-administered.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0081">The invention will now be described by way of examples; however, the invention is not necessarily limited by the examples.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0082">The literature, in general, states that adequate nutrition allows plants to maintain their growth rate in spite of disease but the role of micronutrients in maintaining growth rate in the face of disease has not been well-researched. For example, there is some suggestion or evidence that Mn nutrition may aid in plant disease tolerance. This evidence is based on an apparent inverse correlation between Mn concentration in the plant and disease severity. Other work seems to point to crop plants benefiting to a greater degree from applications of zinc than do bacteria or other pathogens.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0083">Specifically, in the experiment shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, seedlings were grown in cold conditions (overnight in a refrigeration unit) in order to ensure adequate disease incidence for evaluation. At 21 days after emergence, the seedlings were uprooted and assessed as to incidence of root rot lesions. They were then weighed.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0084">In <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the soybean seedling on the left side has root rot lesions but Mn coating on an NPK prill has allowed the seedling to âoutrunâ the disease. On the right side, the seedling is lesioned and the disease is stunting growth. This is shown by the less extensive root structure found in the seedling on the right panel. That is, as will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the fertilizer composition described herein did not control or eliminate root rot but rather allowed the seedlings to thrive despite the presence of the disease.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0085">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> describes an experiment that shows the impact on early growth on four crops when the three elements are applied in a fashion wherein they are of a particle size between 100 and 325 mesh and applied as a coating onto urea and K prills/granules and compares this to the early plant health achieved with phosphate at a standard 35 kg per ha rate. Note total fresh weights are better for seedlings at this optimized ratio.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0086">Specifically, corn grown from the untreated control seeds had a total fresh weight of 8.8 grams, while corn provided a standard âNPKâ fertilizer had a total fresh weight of 11.6 g. However, supplying the corn seeds with the NPK fertilizer product coated with the fertilizer product of the invention produced corn plants having a total fresh weight of 14.0 g.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0087">Similarly, canola grown in control soil had a total fresh weight of 11.5 g. Canola supplied a standard phosphate fertilizer product had a total fresh weight of 20.2. Canola supplied the phosphate fertilizer product coated with the fertilizer product of the invention had a total fresh weight of 22.4 g.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0088">Soybeans grown in control soil had a total fresh weight of 12.4 g. Soybeans supplied an NPK fertilizer had a total fresh weight of 13.2 g. Soybeans supplied the NPK fertilizer coated with the fertilizer powder of the invention had a total fresh weight of 15.0 g.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0089">While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been described above, it will be recognized and understood that various modifications may be made therein, and the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications which may fall within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
