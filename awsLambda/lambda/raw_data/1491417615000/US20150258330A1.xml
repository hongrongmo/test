    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">An intraoperative multichannel brain probe is presented. The brain probe has a cylindrical upper stainless steel section attached to a lower cylindrical section. In the lower section, an outer cylindrical tube surrounds a second insulating tube. Electrically recording/stimulating wires are placed between the outer tube and the second tube. Each wire has one end protruding out a hole in the outer tube. The other end of each wire is threaded through the entire probe and electrically connected to a recording or stimulating device through a connector system. A number of insulating tubes and electrodes located inside the second tube may also be part of the brain probe. Each inner electrode, typically two, is insulated from each other and from the second insulating tube by other insulating tubes. The combination of one or more wires and electrodes provides a multi-functional device. The brain probe is capable of providing multichannel stimulation and/or recording of brain functions and up to 128 individual electrode conducting sites.</p>

      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This invention relates to the fields of neuroscience and electrochemistry. A multichannel brain probe for use in animals and humans in particular is presented.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Neurosurgery has made much advancement in the last few years. With the development of micro-electrical devices, it has become possible to insert very small electrode devices into the cranium without damaging the brain matter. These devices are very useful in recording brain functions and in stimulating parts of the brain. The small electrode devices can treat certain neurological problems such as movement disorders, pain and epilepsy. Discrete anatomical sites can be stimulated to have a therapeutic effect. Recording of electrical data can also be used to help diagnose certain conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Deep brain stimulation by a microelectrode has been shown to be useful in combatting Parkinson's disease as one example. However, this approach has a limitation in that only one brain electrode is provided. A single electrode may either stimulate or record, but not both. It is an object of this invention to provide a multichannel brain probe capable of both stimulating and recording in the same device. The probe can also be used as a diagnostic tool for neurosurgeons or as a research tool for neuroscientists.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Determining which area of the brain to stimulate or record is a complex and difficult task. The use of a multichannel brain probe with a number of discreet microrecording and microstimulating sites also aids the surgeon as it allows him to physiologically determine the location of both target and non-target areas deep within the brain. It is highly desirable if the single shaft brain probe provides both recording and stimulating capability. A single shaft, rather than multiple shafts, minimizes the harmful effects of the surgical procedure. It is another object of this invention to provide a single multichannel brain probe that provides both recording and stimulating capabilities in a single device.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">This device may be used in chronic (greater than one day) neuroscience applications to record electrical activity with amplifiers from live tissue by putting current or voltage through electrode wire contacts. The device may also be used in animal acute (less than one day) neuroscience applications for recording electrical activity with amplifiers from live tissue or stimulating live tissue by putting current or voltage through electrode wire contacts.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The device is most useful for recording and/or stimulation in human applications for targeting populations of neurons for various applications such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) procedures or other such procedures where multiple recording electrode sites and large stimulating electrode sites are required in acute human brain surgeries.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The manufacture of a multichannel microprobe is a difficult task and new engineering and manufacturing techniques are necessary to produce an extremely small yet effective device. Techniques such as the use of small electrically conducting wire and micro welding as well laser drilling of holes have been found to be useful. Additionally, different arrays of sites and combinations of electrodes are presented. It is another and further object of this invention to disclose new and useful manufacturing practices to provide a many new and novel brain probes with new and varied functions.</p>

      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICE</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">A multichannel brain probe for intraoperative uses has an upper stainless steel section attached to a lower recording and/or stimulating section. Both the upper and the lower sections are cylindrical and both have an extremely small cross-section. The lower section comprises concentric cylindrical tubes and electrodes in specific applications. The outer cylindrical tube is an insulating tube and has holes drilled through it in desired patterns. Inside this tube is a second insulating tube. Recording/stimulating wires are positioned in the area between these two insulating tubes. One end of the wires protrudes out of the holes and the other end of the wires are threaded through the entire device and connected to an electronic interface. Other electrodes may also be present in certain applications of the brain probe. These could include an inner conductor electrode, covered by a cylindrical or tubular insulator. A tubular electrode, surrounding the inner conductor electrode and its insulating cover tube, may also be utilized in practicing this invention. The combination of electrodes and wires allows for precise mapping and/or stimulation of brain functions in a human or animal.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">A multi-channel brain probe <b>1</b> offers an improvement over the prior art in that it allows many different electrical functions to be performed intraoperatively and otherwise. The new brain probe <b>1</b> has an extremely small cross-section and may be used in surgical and deployed operations.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">As best shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the brain probe <b>1</b> has a distal end <b>2</b> and a proximal end <b>3</b>. The distal end <b>1</b> may have one or more electrodes that contact the tissue of the subject while the proximal end connects to a computer or other recording, stimulating or multi-function electronics. The brain probe <b>1</b> has two main sections, an upper, tubular neutral stainless steel shaft or shank <b>4</b> and a lower distal end <b>2</b> section. The distal end section <b>2</b> comprises one or more electrodes, insulators and wires as will be explained. The very tip distal end <b>5</b> of the brain probe <b>1</b> is sharpened as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. The brain probe is inserted through the skull and into the meninges and brain matter as shown pictorially in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Turning to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the major components of brain probe <b>1</b> are shown. These components, in the preferred embodiment, comprise an inner conductor electrode <b>6</b>, a stimulating electrode <b>7</b> and an outer, lower cylindrical insulation tube or shaft <b>8</b>. The upper <b>4</b> and lower <b>8</b> tubular shafts are connected together and are continuous after the manufacturing process. The lower shaft has one end continuous with the upper shaft. The other end is sharpened to a point. The main electrical components <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>12</b> are separated by insulating materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The inner electrode <b>6</b> and stimulating electrode <b>7</b> are separated by an insulating tube <b>9</b> as shown in <figref>FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>. There is also an insulating tube <b>10</b> between stimulating electrode <b>7</b> and the outer insulation tube <b>8</b>. Glue <b>11</b> separates and insulates outer insulation tube <b>8</b> and second insulation tube <b>10</b>. This glue <b>11</b> also contains and surrounds the electrode stimulating and/or recording wires <b>12</b>. The outer tube <b>8</b> has a plurality of electrode simulating and recording wire holes <b>13</b> as best shown on <figref>FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">
        <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> show the configuration and relationship of the important parts of the distal end sensors and stimulating electrodes. Each sensor or electrode must be insulated from any other sensor or electrode. Sharpened inner electrode <b>6</b> is made of medical grade metal such as tungsten, platinum-iridium, pure iridium or stainless steel. Since this electrode will come into contact with a patient's brain tissue, it is important that the metal used is medical grade. Electrode <b>6</b> has an inner shaft diameter of 0.075 to 0.5 millimeters and is sharpened to a point and insulated with Parylene-C or other acceptable biocompatible non-conducting polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The tip of electrode <b>6</b> has some of its insulation removed and is exposed so that the tip has an impedance between 0.005 and 2.5 megohm measured at 1.0 kilohertz. This electrode <b>6</b> can be used to record neural activity or it can be used to pass current into the tissue. Electrode <b>6</b> is connected to a dedicated external connector or, alternatively, it can be connected to a multicontact connector. Connectors will be described later in this Specification.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Inner conductor electrode <b>6</b> can also be an uninsulated sharpened metal conductor that can be used as either a reference ground or ground electrode in a different embodiment of the device. It is to be understood that all the dimensions and electrical values used here and in the remainder of this Specification are for purposes of illustration only and are not meant to be specific limitations. The brain probe <b>1</b> has many diverse uses and applications depending upon the specific applications for which it is being used. This second inner conductor electrode <b>6</b> is located inside and is concentric with the first inner tubular electrode <b>7</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The stimulation electrode <b>7</b> is a metal tube electrode typically made of stainless steel. Electrode <b>7</b> has a linear exposure of between 0.25 to 2.0 millimeters. Electrode <b>7</b> is connected to a dedicated external connector or it can be connected to a multi-contact connector as will be explained later. As in the description of electrode <b>6</b>, stimulating electrode <b>7</b> is optional depending upon its specific use and application. First inner tubular conductor electrode <b>7</b> is located inside and concentric with lower outer tubular shaft <b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">A plurality of electrode recording or stimulating wires <b>12</b> are comprised of an outer insulating material and an actual inner metal wire. The inner electrical conductor can be made of platinum-iridium, pure iridium, tungsten, stainless steel or any biocompatible metal. The inner conductor is insulated with Polymide or any other non-conductive polymer. It has been found that at least 4 wires are preferred. The wires <b>12</b> are cut flush with the outer surface of tube <b>8</b> in the manufacturing process. This process and procedure will be explained later in this description but is shown graphically in <figref>FIGS. 8-12</figref>. A typical diameter of the wires <b>12</b> is between 12.5 and 50 microns (0.0125 to 0.050 millimeters). Multiple wires <b>12</b> are utilized in practicing this invention as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. Two or more wires <b>12</b> may also be bundled together to emerge from the same wire holes <b>13</b> located on the outer part of outer tube <b>8</b> to increase the surface area of the metal contact for recording or stimulation or for recording LFP5 (low frequency potentials).</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Stainless steel shaft <b>4</b> is hollow and is utilized to enable the surgeon to have a greater length of penetration, if desired, into the brain or other tissue. The shank <b>4</b> can also be used for ground or reference by electrically attaching it to an external dedicated connector or to a multi-connector. The diameter <b>17</b>â² of shank <b>4</b> is a function of the diameter of the outer insulation tube <b>8</b> since outer insulation tube <b>8</b> fits inside hollow shank tube or <b>4</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Insulation of the various electrical electrode and wires is critical to the proper functioning of the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The primary insulation <b>14</b> on the top surface of electrode <b>6</b> is a non-conductive polymer or other biocompatible material such as Parylene-C or PTFE Teflon. This insulation on electrode <b>6</b> can be exposed at the sharpened tip <b>5</b> to expose the metal underneath to have a specified impedance value.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The insulation <b>9</b> between inner electrode <b>6</b> and stimulation electrode <b>7</b> is typically Polymide or another biocompatible material such as PTFE Teflon. The inner diameter of tube <b>8</b> must be able to fit over inner electrode <b>6</b> at a minimum.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Insulation <b>10</b> between inner stimulation electrode <b>7</b> and electrode stimulation/recording wires <b>12</b> is also typically Polymide or another biocompatible insulating material such as PTFE Teflon. The inner diameter of the inner tube <b>8</b> is also required to fit over both electrode <b>6</b> and stimulating electrode <b>7</b> if both electrodes are being used in a particular manufacturing application.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The insulation over the electrode wires <b>12</b> is typically Polymide or any other biocompatible insulating materials. Other biocompatible insulating materials are well known in the art and are claimed as part of the new, novel and unique brain probe described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The insulation tube <b>8</b> in typically Polymide or other biocompatible insulating material such as PTFE Teflon or PEEK. The inner diameter of insulating tube <b>8</b> is a function of the number of wires <b>12</b> and wire holes <b>13</b> used in the manufacture of a particular brain probe. The inner diameter of tube <b>8</b> is also affected by which combination of inner electrode <b>6</b>, stimulation electrode <b>7</b>, and insulators <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>14</b> are utilized in a particular brain probe manufacture and application.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The particular glues utilized are also important to the manufacture, use and performance of this device. A medical grade cyanoacrylic or very low viscosity medical grade epoxy is used for bonding inner electrode <b>6</b> to insulation tube <b>9</b> and for bonding insulation tube <b>9</b> to stimulation electrode <b>7</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Glue <b>11</b> is of particular importance in practicing this invention. Glue <b>11</b> is used in between insulating tube <b>10</b> and the outer insulation tube <b>8</b>. This glue is used to fill the void between 8 and 10 once wires <b>12</b> have been inserted into the void and properly aligned in holes <b>13</b>. Inserted wires <b>12</b> before the injection of the glue are shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>. Once wires <b>12</b> have been inserted into the void between 10 and 8 this glue <b>11</b> is injected into the void and fills the area between 10 and 8 completely, up to the outer surface of tube <b>8</b>. Silicone <b>27</b> is then applied above hole <b>13</b> on the top surface of tube <b>8</b> as best shown in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>. The wire <b>12</b> protrudes out through the hole <b>13</b> but remains sealed in silicone <b>27</b> as shown. As shown in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, the excess silicone is then removed from the outside of tube <b>8</b> by either mechanically peeling or dissolving, or both, the silicone <b>27</b>. Precision wire cutters or other process are then used to cut wire <b>12</b> flush to the outer surface of tube <b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Finished site <b>13</b>, as best shown in <figref>FIGS. 8 and 8A</figref> comprises the electrode wire or wires flush with the outer surface of outer insulation tube <b>8</b>. The metal surface of the inner metal wire comes into contact with the tissue of the patient for recording or stimulation purposes.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Outer insulating tube <b>8</b> is also glues to the stainless steel shank <b>4</b> with medical grade cyanoacrylate or very low viscosity medical epoxy.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Turning now to <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the dimensions of the preferred embodiment are shown. It is to be understood that the dimensions shown and described are of a preferred embodiment and are not a limitation on the brain probe device. Many variations of the multichannel brain probe are within the disclosure and contemplation of this device. For example, inclusion of an inner electrode conductor <b>6</b> is optional as is the inclusion of the stimulation electrode <b>7</b>. Additionally, the number of wires <b>12</b> may also vary and the placement, configuration and number of wire holes <b>13</b> may also vary. The following dimensions are typical, however, and describe the general size of the components.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The size of the holes <b>13</b> and the distance <b>22</b> between holes <b>13</b> are a function of the size of the wire or bundled wires designed to be threaded through the hole <b>13</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the hole diameter <b>16</b> is proportional to the number and size wire going through hole <b>13</b>. Holes <b>13</b> are generally spaced 0.050 to 1.0 mm apart. The most distal hole is typically 0.5 to 1.0 mm from the tip of insulation tubing <b>8</b> as shown by dimension <b>20</b> on <figref>FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The general length <b>17</b> of the stainless or microfill tube <b>4</b> can vary from 5 to 310 mm while the overall length of the polymide insulation tube <b>8</b> varies depending on the specific application for which it is intended. The diameter <b>17</b>â² of the stainless steel shaft is a function of the diameter of the distal end components that must fit inside the shaft <b>4</b>. The maximum length <b>18</b> of polymide tube may vary from between 5 to 50 mm. These lengths may vary depending upon the specific application for which the probe is intended. Dimensions given here are for purposes of illustration only.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In the preferred embodiment, the length <b>19</b> from the distal tip end of polymide insulation tubing <b>8</b> to the distal tip end of tungsten electrode <b>6</b> will vary depending on the specific application. The diameter <b>21</b> of insulation tubing <b>8</b> is a function of whether or not the embodiment includes electrodes <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> and the size and number of wires <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Recording sites may vary and may be designated as ânâ recording sites for purposes of this invention. Recording sites n coincide with the holes <b>13</b>. The distance between holes <b>13</b> (and hence recording or stimulation sites n) is approximately 0.1 to 1.0 mm in the preferred embodiment but may vary independently depending upon the number of recording sites needed in any variation of the device. An exact number of holes or their placement is not a limitation on this invention as many different numbers and placements of recording sites is well within the spirit and disclosure of this invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The placement and configuration of electrode wires <b>12</b> (and thus recording sites n) are best shown in <figref>FIGS. 7A</figref>, <b>7</b>B, <b>7</b>C and <b>7</b>D. The instant invention contemplates the placement of between 4 and 128 wires in outer insulation tube <b>8</b> in a variety of arrays. Holes <b>13</b> (recording sites n) depends upon the design and actual use of the brain probe <b>1</b>. Holes can be placed anywhere along insulating tube <b>8</b> as well as circumferentially and in groups. The holes <b>13</b> are finished using mechanical or laser drilling. Laser drilling is more precise.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Examples of arrays are found in drawing <figref>FIGS. 7A-7D</figref>. Recording sites n may be located in a linear distribution <b>23</b> on one side as shown in <figref>FIG. 7A</figref>. They may be located in a linear distribution on opposite sides <b>24</b> as in <figref>FIG. 7B</figref>. They may be located in a spiral distribution <b>25</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 7C</figref>. They may also be placed in groups of 2, 3 or 4. Distribution in groups <b>26</b> of 4 is shown in <figref>FIG. 7D</figref> and can provide multiple tetrode groupings.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Electrode wires <b>12</b>, comprising an outer wire insulation and inner metal conductor are typically pre-insulated with Polymide or some other non-conductive polymer. In manufacture, the wires are cut 20 percent longer than the total length of the LMA brain probe <b>1</b>. The wires <b>12</b> are then threaded through the hole <b>13</b> of insulating tube <b>8</b> and pushed up and out the insulation tube <b>8</b>. At the hole <b>13</b> of the tube <b>8</b>, the hole end of each wire <b>12</b> extends out of the hole <b>13</b> and past the outer surface of tube <b>8</b> by approximately 1 cm. The connector end of each wire is attached to a multi-contact connector <b>28</b> by soldering or microwelding. In this process, it is important to note and detail which hole <b>13</b> and wire <b>12</b> is attached to which connector position.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">A plurality of wires <b>12</b> is located inside the outer tubular shaft <b>8</b>. As many wires <b>12</b> as are needed in each embodiment are threaded through the outer insulation tube <b>8</b> between tube <b>8</b> and insulation tube <b>10</b>. Each wire <b>12</b> has a hole end of each wire protruding out of a hole <b>13</b>. The connector end of each wire is soldered or micro welded to a particular contact on the connector <b>28</b>. This process is repeated for as many wires as are needed in the particular embodiment until all holes <b>13</b> have been populated.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">After all wires <b>12</b> have been threaded through all holes <b>13</b> forceps or other tools are used to insure that the wire <b>12</b> extends past the outer surface of tube <b>8</b> as best shown in <figref>FIGS. 9-12</figref>. A thin coat of silicone <b>27</b> is then applied over each hole <b>13</b> to insure that epoxy <b>11</b> does not extend beyond the outer surface of the hole <b>13</b> when the epoxy <b>11</b> is injected to fill the space between tubes <b>8</b> and <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">In embodiments wherein a hole position will be used to record single neuron action potentials, low frequency potentials (LFP5), or to stimulate with electrical current, a single hole can be made larger in order to accommodate a bundle (more than one) of wires. Bundling multiple wires together increases the surface area of the wire ends. In this case, the connector ends of all wires bundled together will be connected to the same contact on connector <b>28</b>. Wires going through the same hole and bundled together are then by definition electrically parallel. Multiple wires through holes <b>13</b> may be attached to different contacts for other applications.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">
        <figref>FIGS. 9 through 12</figref> illustrate the method of manufacture of a preferred embodiment of this brain probe. <figref>FIG. 9</figref> shows the wire comprising the wire insulation <b>15</b> and the inner metal conductor as it is being pulled upward and outward through hole <b>13</b>. A layer of silicone <b>27</b> is then placed on top of hole <b>13</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>. Epoxy <b>11</b> or other suitable insulating material is then forced into the area between insulation tube <b>8</b> and tube <b>10</b> such that the epoxy goes up to the upper surface of hole <b>13</b> and stops where the silicone <b>27</b> has been applied over hole <b>13</b> and emerging wire <b>12</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>. The top end <b>12</b>â² of wire <b>12</b> and the top end <b>27</b>â² of silicone <b>27</b> is then finished by cutting off the top flush with the top outer surface of tube <b>8</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>. The silicone <b>27</b> and excess wire are discarded. The inner conductor wire is left exposed as shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>. The inner top metal surface of conductor wire <b>12</b> is able to contact the tissue of the subject when the probe is inserted. The finished product along with the other elements of the brain probe is shown in <figref>FIGS. 8 and 8A</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The wires <b>12</b> are then threaded through both the lower <b>8</b> and the upper <b>4</b> shafts. The other connector ends of inner electrical conductive wires <b>12</b> are soldered to contacts on electrical connector <b>28</b>. Connector <b>28</b> is a standard connector well known and utilized in this industry. Connectors <b>28</b> are well known in the art and are manufactured by, for example, Omnetics Connector Corporation and Samtec Corporation. These connectors are shown on <figref>FIG. 13</figref>. The connector wire ends are soldered to contacts on connector <b>28</b>. The outer interface of connector <b>28</b> is then electrically connected to a mating connector <b>29</b> that will interface to an amplifier, stimulator, data acquisition or a computer interface. The connector <b>28</b> is basically a multichannel connector device that connects through a mating connector to an amplifier, stimulator, data acquisition or computer to the wires <b>12</b> or other electrodes. The inner part of the connector and the wires electrically connected to the connector <b>28</b> are then covered with epoxy <b>31</b> as shown in <figref>FIGS. 13A</figref>, <b>13</b>B and <b>13</b>C. Different orientations of the multi contact connectors as shown in <figref>FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref> is within the spirit and disclosure of this invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">
        <figref>FIG. 13B</figref> shows an optional ground reference wire <b>32</b> from the multicontact connector <b>28</b> that protrudes out of the epoxy <b>31</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">
        <figref>FIG. 13C</figref> shows an alternate connector with a pin <b>30</b> protruding through the epoxy. Pin connector <b>30</b> would usually be electrically connected to stimulating electrode <b>7</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">
        <figref>FIG. 14</figref> is a side cutaway view of the inner conductor electrode <b>6</b> and the stimulating electrode <b>7</b> in the assembled and preferred embodiment of the brain probe <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Inner electrode <b>6</b> can be made of tungsten or other suitable metal and have a length of up to 310 mm. The typical diameter of electrode <b>6</b> is from 0.075 to 0.50 mm. If the electrode <b>6</b> is used for recording electrical activity or for stimulating with electrical current it is insulated <b>9</b> with Parylene or another suitable polymer or epoxy compound. Electrode <b>6</b> is sharpened at its distal end <b>41</b> to a specified tip diameter. The tip diameter is a function of the desired electrical properties of the electrode. The electrode <b>6</b> tip is exposed using high voltage plasma or a laser to have a surface area required for either recording or stimulating. The amount of exposure is a function of the uses for the electrode in a particular application.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">Inner electrode <b>6</b> is covered, or surrounded, by insulation. This insulation usually takes the form of a polymide or other suitable polymer tube insulating tube <b>9</b> as previously described. The inner diameter of insulating tube <b>9</b> is such that it fits tightly over the inner electrode <b>6</b>. This insulating tube <b>9</b> is glued at a specified and designated distance from the distal end <b>41</b> of electrode <b>6</b>. Insulating tube <b>9</b> extends nearly the entire length of electrode <b>6</b> leaving only 2 to 10 mm without Polymide tubing insulation at the proximal end <b>40</b> of electrode <b>6</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">Stimulating electrode <b>7</b> is made of stainless steel or another biocompatible metal. Stimulating electrode <b>7</b> has an inner diameter such that it fits tightly over Polymide insulating tube <b>9</b>. Stimulating electrode <b>7</b> is polished at the distal end <b>41</b> and is glued to insulating tube <b>9</b>. Stimulating electrode <b>7</b> is shorter than electrode <b>6</b>. Insulation tube <b>10</b> has an inner diameter that such that tube <b>10</b> fits tightly over stimulating electrode <b>7</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>. Insulating tube <b>10</b> is glued to stimulating electrode <b>7</b> leaving approximately 0.25 to 2.0 mm exposed at the distal end <b>41</b>. Insulation tube <b>10</b> extends to within approximately 5 mm of the proximal end <b>40</b> of the inner electrode <b>6</b>. The proximal end of the electrodes <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> and staggered so that no electrical connections can be made between the two electrodes as is standard in this art.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The integration of electrodes <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> and threaded electrode wires <b>12</b> within outer insulating tube <b>10</b> is done in the following manner. One first assures that the proximal ends <b>40</b> of electrodes <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref> do not have any sharp edges. Manufacturing assembly <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>9</b> (inner electrode <b>6</b>, insulation tube <b>9</b> and stimulating electrode <b>7</b>) is inserted into outer insulating tube <b>10</b> after the threaded wires <b>12</b> have been inserted into holes <b>13</b> and threaded through the area between insulation tube <b>10</b> and outer insulation tube <b>8</b>. Assembly comprising 6, 7 and 9 is twisted as it is being pushed into tube <b>10</b> to minimize the force necessary.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">After manufacturing assembly A has been inserted approximately 80 to 95 percent of the required distance through outer tube <b>8</b>, epoxy glue <b>11</b> is injected into the area between tubes <b>10</b> and <b>8</b> as shown in <figref>FIGS. 8-12</figref> and previously described until the epoxy <b>11</b> begins to emerge out the proximal end <b>40</b> of tube <b>8</b> the assembly. The manufacturing assembly A is then inserted further into tube <b>8</b> to the specified distance insuring that the assembly A is centered within tube <b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">Assembly A must be centered within and concentric with outer tube <b>8</b> perfectly. To insure the perfect eccentric alignment of assembly A and tube <b>8</b> a stainless steel or Polyimide collar <b>43</b> is inserted between tube <b>8</b> and tube <b>10</b> at the distal <b>41</b> of the device as best shown on <figref>FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The epoxy in the assembled unit is then cured in an oven at a specified temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">Silicon is then removed from the outer surface of the outer tube <b>8</b>. Special scissors are then used to cut the metal wires <b>12</b> so that they are flush with the outer surface of outer tube <b>8</b>. The technician then slides stainless steel tube <b>4</b> over the entire assembly if it is required to extend the length of the brain probe. Stainless steel tube <b>4</b> is then glued in place using an appropriate biocompatible glue.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">In practicing this invention, different presentations of the brain probe <b>1</b> are well within the contemplation of this disclosure. For example, as shown on <figref>FIG. 15A</figref> a plurality of probes <b>34</b> may be connected to a single connector <b>33</b> or to multiple connectors. This type of multi-shank LMA design is ideal for acute or chronic applications. However, each shank can have up to 64 electrode sites, and therefore multiple connectors may be required for this type of deployment.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">Another type of brain probe can have tethered probes <b>35</b> using flexible electrically conductive cables <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>. Conductive cables contain the wires <b>12</b> that are encased in silicone adhesive and/or a silicone tube. This brain probe with flexible output cables <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> has been designed specifically for chronic applications. The fine leads <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> are coiled together and coated with a silicon elastomer, allowing the shank <b>35</b> to virtually float in the brain tissue without harming the subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">Also within the disclosure and contemplation of this invention is an ultra-small brain probe <b>38</b> with flexible cables.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">It is to be understood that many different variations of the instant device are within the spirit and contemplation of this invention. Different size primary electrodes <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> can be manufactured to different electrical specifications by varying the diameters or surface tip exposure of the electrodes. Additionally, many different patterns of holes or number and size of electrode wires <b>12</b> are contemplated. Dimensions given are for purposes of illustration only and are not meant to be limitations on the scope of the disclosure.</p>
