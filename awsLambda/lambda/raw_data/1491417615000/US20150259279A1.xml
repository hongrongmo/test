      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Carbamic acid esters (urethanes) are compounds that are widely used in applications such as polyurethane foam, surface coatings, elastomers, paints and adhesives, and are industrially extremely useful. In addition, carbamic acid esters are also useful as raw materials for producing isocyanates without using phosgene.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Industrial production of isocyanates mainly uses a reaction between an amine compound and phosgene (âphosgene methodâ), and nearly the entire amount of isocyanates produced worldwide is produced using the phosgene method. However, the phosgene method has numerous problems.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Firstly, a large amount of phosgene is used as a raw material. Phosgene is an extremely highly toxic substance, its handling requires special precautions to prevent handlers from being exposed, and special measures are also required to detoxify waste.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Secondly, since a large amount of highly corrosive hydrogen chloride is produced as a by-product of the phosgene method, in addition to requiring a process for detoxifying this hydrogen chloride, since hydrolysable salts are frequently contained in the isocyanates produced, in the case of using isocyanates produced according to the phosgene method, there are cases in which they have a detrimental effect on the weather resistance and heat resistance of polyurethane products.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In consideration of these factors, there is a need for a process for producing isocyanate compounds that does not use phosgene. One process that has been proposed for the production of isocyanates without using phosgene involves thermal decomposition of carbamic acid ester. Isocyanates and hydroxy compounds have long been known to be obtained from thermal decomposition of carbamic acid esters (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 1: Berchte der Deutechen Chemischen Gesellschaft, Vol. 3, p. 653, 1870). The basis reaction thereof is indicated by the following formula:</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]R(NHCOORâ²)<sub>x</sub>âR(NCO)<sub>x</sub>+ÃRâ²OHââ(1)[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0000">(wherein R represents an organic residue having a valence of x, Râ² represents a monovalent organic residue, and x represents an integer of 1 or more).</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0007">In this manner, although carbamic acid esters are industrially useful compounds, since carbamic acid esters easily form hydrogen bonds between molecules from ester groups forming the carbamic acid ester, they frequently have a high melting point. Typically, in the case of using a substance industrially, operations such as those for transferring that substance or storing that substance in a storage tank for a fixed period of time are required. In the transfer of a carbamic acid ester having a high melting point, a solid carbamic acid ester, for example, is crushed or treated with a vehicle for processing into the pellets and the like prior to transfer, or the carbamic acid ester is liquefied prior to transfer by heating to a temperature higher than the melting point of the carbamic acid ester. However, in the case of transferring the solid carbamic ester that has been treated with the vehicle for processing into the pellets, there is a need for a complex apparatus to ensure stable transfer of a fixed amount of carbamic acid ester or the need for a process for maintaining the form of the carbamic acid ester within a certain range in cases of the risk of clogging of the transfer line or frequent fluctuations in the form of the carbamic acid ester. On the other hand, in the case of transferring carbamic acid ester in the form of a liquid by heating, it is necessary to heat to a temperature higher than the melting point of the carbamic acid ester (for example, 200Â° C.) in consideration of preventing solidification during transfer. In the case of holding a carbamic acid ester under such high temperatures, undesirable side reactions may occur that cause a decrease in the yield of the carbamic acid ester. Examples of such side reactions may include the reactions of the following formulas (2) and (3) that occur due to isocyanate formed by the occurrence of a thermal decomposition reaction of carbamic acid ester as shown in formula (1) above, and the thermal denaturation reaction of carbamic acid ester as shown in the following formula (4) (see Non-Patent Document 1 and Non-Patent Document 2).</p>

      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0000">(wherein each of R and Râ² independently represents an organic group such as a aliphatic group or alicyclic group).</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0008">These side reactions not only lead to a decrease in the yield of carbamic acid ester, but in the case of handling carbamic acid esters in particular, there may also be precipitation of polymeric solids resulting in clogging of transfer lines or accumulation in storage tanks.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0009">Several Methods have been Proposed to Solve these Problems.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0010">Patent Document 1 discloses a method for storing or transporting aromatic urethane (carbamic acid ester equivalent to the product of a reaction between an aromatic isocyanate and a hydroxy compound) in the presence of an organic solvent. Although this method is characterized by the use of from 1 to 10 times the weight, based on the aromatic urethane, of an organic solvent that is inert with respect to the urethane and the isocyanate corresponding to that urethane, in this method, a decrease in the urethane cannot be inhibited, and a large amount of substances having unknown structures are produced.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0011">In addition, Patent Document 2 discloses a method for storing an aromatic urethane solution by using 1,4-dioxane as a solvent for dissolving the urethane. However, in this method, since an equivalent amount (for example, 20 times the weight) of 1,4-dioxane must be used with respect to the urethane, this method had the problem of resulting in a decrease in the storage efficiency of the urethane.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0012">In this manner, methods used to transfer or store carbamic acid esters without causing denaturation thereof still have problems remaining.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0013">On the other hand, various processes have been proposed thus far for the production of carbamic acid esters.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0014">According to the description of Patent Document 3, an aliphatic diurethane and/or alicyclic diurethane and/or aliphatic polyurethane and/or alicyclic polyurethane are obtained by reacting an aliphatic primary diamine and/or alicyclic primary diamine and/or aliphatic primary polyamine and/or alicyclic primary polyamine with O-alkylcarbamate in the presence of an alcohol and in the presence or absence of a catalyst at 160 to 300Â° C. at a ratio of amine NH<sub>2 </sub>group: carbamate:alcohol of 1:0.8 to 10:0.25 to 50, followed by removing the ammonia formed as necessary.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0015">In addition, according to Patent Document 4, an aryl diurethane and/or aryl polyurethane is produced by reacting an aromatic primary amine and/or aromatic primary polyamine with O-alkylcarbamate in the presence or absence of a catalyst and in the presence or absence of urea and alcohol to form an aryl diurethane and/or aryl polyurethane followed by removing the ammonia formed as necessary.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0016">Other publications contain descriptions relating to partial substitution of urea and/or diamine by a carbonyl-containing compound such as N-substituted carbamate and/or dialkyl carbonate, or mono-substituted urea, di-substituted urea, mono-substituted polyurea or di-substituted polyurea (see Patent Document 5, Patent Document 6, Patent Document 7, Patent Document 8 and Patent Document 9). Patent Document 10 describes a process for producing aliphatic O-arylurethane by reacting a (cyclic) aliphatic polyamine with urea and an aromatic hydroxy compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0017">In addition, according to Patent Document 11, a process is disclosed for producing a carbamic acid ester from an amine compound and dimethyl carbonate. This process reacts an amine compound and dimethyl carbonate in the presence of Lewis acid catalyst, lead, titanium, zirconium catalyst or alkaline catalyst and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0018">In this manner, although various methods are known for producing carbamic acid esters, at the time of using these carbamic acid ester, an operation is required for recovering the carbamic acid ester from a mixture containing the carbamic acid ester produced according to these methods. Several methods have been disclosed for recovering carbamic acid esters.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0019">Patent Document 12 discloses a method distilling one or more types of diurethanes in the presence of a low boiling point alcohol having an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an alicyclic hydrocarbon group having 5 or 6 carbon atoms. However, this method also had the problem of solid substances remaining in the distillation apparatus.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0020">In addition, Patent Document 13 describes a method for distillative separation of an unreacted amine compound and alcohol from a reaction liquid obtained by reacting a carbonic acid ester and an amine compound. However, since a solution mainly containing carbamic acid ester is heated in the bottom of a distillation column during the time the distillative separation operation is being carried out, a thermal denaturation reaction like that described above may occur according to this method as well, thereby preventing the obtaining of an adequate recovery rate. In addition, Patent Document 14 describes a process for producing isocyanate by thermal decomposition of a carbamic acid ester after having synthesized the carbamic acid ester by reacting a diamine and dimethyl carbonate. In this process, although the carbamic acid ester is isolated by distillative purification, this distillative purification is preferably carried out in the presence of an inert solvent having a boiling point at least 10Â° C. lower than the carbamic acid ester. In this distillative purification method, since the carbamic acid ester is heated in the bottom of a distillation column in the same manner as the previously described method, the recovery rate cannot be said to be adequate.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0021">In this manner, methods for separating carbamic acid esters from a mixture obtained in a carbamic acid ester production process still have problems remaining.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0022">On the other hand, various methods have been proposed for producing isocyanates by using a carbamic acid ester as a raw material.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0023">According to the description of Patent Document 3, an aliphatic diurethane and/or alicyclic diurethane and/or aliphatic polyurethane and/or alicyclic polyurethane are obtained by reacting an aliphatic primary diamine and/or alicyclic primary diamine and/or aliphatic primary polyamine and/or alicyclic primary polyamine with O-alkylcarbamate in the presence of an alcohol and in the presence or absence of a catalyst at from 160 to 300Â° C. at a ratio of amine NH<sub>2 </sub>group: carbamate: alcohol of 1:0.8 to 10:0.25 to 50, followed by removing the ammonia formed as necessary. The resulting diurethane and/or polyurethane can be converted to the corresponding diisocyanate and/or highly functional polyisocyanate as necessary. Detailed reaction conditions with respect to thermal decomposition are not described in this publication.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0024">According to Patent Document 4, an aromatic diisocyanate and/or polyisocyanate are produced by going through the following two steps. In the first step, an aromatic primary amine and/or aromatic primary polyamine are reacted with O-alkylcarbamate in the presence or absence of a catalyst and in the presence or absence of urea and alcohol to form an aryl diurethane and/or aryl polyurethane followed by removing the ammonia formed as necessary. In the second step, an aromatic isocyanate and/or aromatic polyisocyanate are obtained by thermal decomposition of the aryl diurethane and/or aryl polyurethane.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0025">Several methods are known for forming a corresponding isocyanate and alcohol by thermal decomposition of a (cyclic) aliphatic, and particularly aromatic monourethane and diurethane, and although these methods may include methods carried out in a gaseous phase at a high temperature and methods carried out in a liquid phase under comparatively low temperature conditions, since there are cases in which the reaction mixture forms precipitates, polymeric substances and occlusions in the reaction vessel and recovery apparatus due to the occurrence of side reactions as described above, for example, economic efficiency is poor in the case of producing isocyanates over a long period of time.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0026">Thus, chemical methods such as the use of a special catalyst (see Patent Document 15 and Patent Document 16) or a catalyst in combination with an inert solvent (see Patent Document 17) have been disclosed to improve yield during thermal decomposition of urethanes.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0027">More specifically, Patent Document 18 describes a process for producing hexamethylene diisocyanate comprising thermal decomposition of hexamethylene diethylurethane in the presence of dibenzyl toluene used as a solvent, and in the presence of a catalyst mixture containing methyl toluenesulfonate and diphenyl tin dichloride. However, since there is no detailed description provided regarding production of the starting components or isolation, purification or voluntary recovery of the solvent and catalyst mixture, it is not possible to assess the economic efficiency of this process.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0028">According to the method described in Patent Document 19, urethane can be easily decomposed to an isocyanate and an alcohol in a carbon-containing fluidized bed without using a catalyst. In addition, according to Patent Document 20, hexamethylene dialkyl urethane can be decomposed in a gaseous phase at a temperature in excess of 300Â° C. in the presence or absence of a gas-permeable packaging material composed of, for example, carbon, copper, bronze, steel, zinc, aluminum, titanium, chromium, cobalt or quartz to form hexamethylene diisocyanate. According to the description of Patent Document 14, the process is carried out in the presence of a hydrogen halide and/or hydrogen halide donor. However, this method is unable to achieve a hexamethylene diisocyanate yield of 90% or more. This is because the decomposition products are partially rebonded resulting in the formation of urethane bonds. Thus, further purification of hexamethylene diisocyanate by distillation is required, and this frequently results in an increase in yield loss.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0029">Moreover, Patent Document 21 discloses that a monocarbamate can be decomposed at a satisfactory yield without using a solvent in the presence or absence of a catalyst and/or stabilizer advantageously under reduced pressure and at a comparatively low temperature. The decomposition products (monoisocyanate and alcohol) are removed from the boiling reaction mixture by distillation and are captured separately by fractional condensation. A method is described in a generic form for partially removing the reaction mixture in order to remove by-products formed during thermal decomposition. Thus, although by-products can be removed from the bottom of the reaction vessel, the problem with respect to the case of adhering to the walls of the reaction vessel as previously described remains, and the problem with respect to long-term operation is unresolved. In addition, there is no description regarding the industrial use of the removed residue (containing a large amount of useful components).</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0030">According to the description of Patent Document 22, thermal decomposition of an aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic polycarbamate is carried at from 150 to 350Â° C. and from 0.001 to 20 bar in the presence of an inert solvent and in the presence or absence of a catalyst, auxiliary agent in the form of hydrogen chloride, organic acid chloride, alkylating agent or organic tin chloride. By-products formed can be removed continuously from the reaction vessel together with the reaction solution, for example, and a corresponding amount of fresh solvent or recovered solvent is added simultaneously. A disadvantage of this method is that, for example, a decrease in the space-time yield of polyisocyanate occurs due to the use of a refluxing solvent, and what is more, a large amount of energy is required, including that for recovering the solvent, for example. Moreover, the auxiliary agent that is used is volatile under the reaction conditions, and the decomposition products may be contaminated. In addition, the amount of residue is large relative to the amount of polyisocyanate formed, thereby making the economic efficiency and reliability as an industrial method suspect.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0031">Patent Document 23 describes one method for continuous thermal decomposition of a carbamate, such as an alicyclic diurethane 5-(ethoxycarbonylamino)-1-(ethoxycarbonylaminomethyl)-1,3,3-trimethylcyclohexane, supplied along the inner surface of a tubular reaction vessel in a liquid form in the presence of a high boiling point solvent. This method has the disadvantages of low yield and low selectivity during production of a (cyclic) aliphatic diisocyanate. In addition, there is no description of a continuous method accompanying recovery of rebonded or partially decomposed carbamate, and post-treatment of solvent containing by-products and catalyst is also not mentioned.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0032">The description of Patent Document 24 relates to a circulation method for producing (cyclic) aliphatic diisocyanate by converting a corresponding diamine to diurethane followed by thermal decomposition of this urethane. This method minimizes the decrease in yield by recirculating the product from a urethane decomposition step to an urethanation step following reaction with alcohol. By-products that are unable to be recirculated are removed by separation by distilling a mixture of urethanation products, and in this case, unwanted residue forms in the form of bottom products while all comparatively low boiling point components, including diurethane, are removed from the top of the column. This method, however has a disadvantage of using a large amount of energy. This is because all diurethane is required to be evaporated in the presence of a catalyst, and this diurethane must be evaporated at a temperature level within the range of the decomposition temperature of urethane. Isocyanate groups formed in useful products react with residual urethane groups, frequently resulting in the formation of comparatively high molecular weight by-products that cause a reduction in yield.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0033">In addition, according to the description of Patent Document 25, a method is disclosed whereby unwanted by-products are partially removed prior to carrying out thermal decomposition of polyurethane. The disadvantage of this method is that the yield of isocyanate decreases as a result of polyurethane being contained in the partially removed by-products. In addition, since polymeric compounds form and adhere to the reaction vessel as a result of heating of by-products remaining in the reaction vessel without being discharged from the reaction vessel, long-term, continuous operation is difficult.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0034">As has been described above, processes for producing isocyanates using carbamic acid esters as raw materials have numerous problems to be solved and have yet to be industrialized. <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li>Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. S59-48452</li><li>Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2004-262831</li><li>Patent Document 3: U.S. Pat.

Furthermore, the present invention is not limited to the following present embodiment, but rather can be modified in various ways within the scope of the gist thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0090">An explanation is first provided of a composition comprising a carbamic acid ester and an aromatic hydroxy compound in the present embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0091">In the composition comprising the carbamic acid ester and the aromatic hydroxy compound in the present embodiment:</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0092">when the number of mole of an ester group constituting the carbamic acid ester contained in the composition is defined as A, and the number of mole of the aromatic hydroxy compound contained in the composition is defined as B, then a ratio of B to A (B/A) is preferably within a range of from 0.1 to 50, and a melting point of the composition is 150Â° C. or lower. In a preferable aspect of the present embodiment, the composition is a composition for transfer and storage of carbamic acid ester.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0093">Since carbamic acid esters used in the present embodiment easily form hydrogen bonds between molecules by the ester groups constituting the carbamic acid esters, they frequently have a high melting point. In the transfer of such a carbamic acid ester, a solid carbamic acid ester, for example, is crushed or treated with a vehicle for processing into pellets and the like prior to transfer, or the carbamic acid ester is liquefied prior to transfer by heating to a temperature higher than the melting point of the carbamic acid ester. However, in the case of transferring the solid carbamic ester that has been treated with the vehicle, there is a need for a complex apparatus to ensure stable transfer of a fixed amount of carbamic acid ester or the need for a process for maintaining the form of the carbamic acid ester within a certain range in cases of the risk of clogging of the transfer line or frequent fluctuations in the form of the carbamic acid ester. On the other hand, in the case of transferring carbamic acid ester in the form of a liquid by heating, although it is necessary to heat to a temperature higher than the melting point of the carbamic acid ester (for example, 200Â° C.) in consideration of preventing solidification during transfer, in the case of holding a carbamic acid ester under such high temperatures, there are frequently cases in which isocyanate may be formed at undesirable locations due to the occurrence of a thermal decomposition reaction of the carbamic acid ester or the occurrence of a thermal denaturation reaction of the carbamic acid ester as previously described. The composition of the present embodiment demonstrates the effect of being able to maintain the stability of the carbamic acid ester by inhibiting thermal denaturation of the carbamic acid ester in the composition during transfer or storage of the composition. Although the mechanism by which the effect of inhibiting thermal denaturation of the carbamic acid ester is demonstrated is not clear, the inventors of the present invention presumed that, as a result of the aromatic hydroxy compound that forms the composition forming hydrogen bonds between urethane bonds (âNHCOOâ) of the carbamic acid ester and the aromatic hydroxy compound, a state is formed in which the urethane bonds have difficulty in approaching each other, thereby making it difficult for a reaction that forms urea bonds to occur as in, for example, a reaction that forms urea bonds represented by formula (2) above.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0094">In the composition of the present embodiment, although the number of mole (B) of the aromatic hydroxy compound is preferably greater than the number of mole (A) of the ester group constituting the carbamic acid ester, on the other hand, in consideration of carbamic acid ester transfer efficiency and the size of the storage tank at the time of storage, the ratio of B to A (B/A) is preferably from 0.2 to 30, more preferably from 0.3 to 20 and even more preferably from 0.5 to 10.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0095">In addition, the melting point of the carbamic acid ester constituting the composition of the present embodiment is 200Â° C. or lower, the melting point of the aromatic hydroxy compound is preferably 190Â° C. or lower, and the composition composed of the carbamic acid ester and the aromatic hydroxy compound is preferably a homogeneous liquid at 180Â° C. When transferring the composition in liquid form, although the composition is made to be in a liquid form by heating the composition to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point thereof, in the case the temperature at which the composition becomes a homogeneous liquid is higher than 180Â° C., thermal decomposition of the carbamic acid ester constituting the composition occurs when transforming the composition into liquid form, thereby resulting in the case of isocyanate being formed at undesirable locations and making this undesirable. From such a viewpoint, the temperature at which the composition becomes a homogeneous liquid is preferably 180Â° C. or lower, and in consideration of the ease of maintaining the temperature of the transfer line and the like, the temperature is more preferably 150Â° C. or lower and even more preferably 100Â° C. or lower.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0096">In general, the term âmelting pointâ refers to a temperature when a solid phase and liquid phase are considered to be in a state of equilibrium, and indicates a value based on a pressure of one atmosphere. In the present embodiment, the melting point can be measured by the known method, such as with a melting point measuring apparatus described in the literature (Combined Chemical Dictionary 9, p. 357, Kyoritsu Shuppan Co., Ltd., Japan, 2003). In addition, melting point can readily be measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or differential thermal analysis (DTA), and for example, the endothermic peak measured during heating of a solid substance at a heating rate of 5Â° C./min under a nitrogen atmosphere with a differential scanning calorimeter can be defined as the melting point.</p>

      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0120">The inventors of the present invention surprisingly found that the carbamic acid ester does not undergo the thermal denaturation reaction as described above and is stable in the presence of the aromatic hydroxy compound. Although the mechanism by which denaturation of carbamic acid ester is inhibited is not clear, the inventors of the present invention presumed that, for example, ester groups of the carbamic acid ester and the aromatic hydroxy compound form hydrogen bonds, and corresponding ester groups are inhibited from approaching each other by the hydrogen bonds, thereby inhibiting a decarboxylation reaction by corresponding ester groups of the carbamic acid ester as shown in formula (2) above. In addition, even more unexpectedly, the temperature at which the composition of the present embodiment, comprising the carbamic acid ester and the aromatic hydroxy compound, is a liquid is lower than the melting point of the carbamic acid ester as well as the melting point of the aromatic hydroxy compound, and since the composition can be held at a comparatively low temperature during transfer or storage in liquid form, the effect is also demonstrated by which the thermal denaturation reaction of the carbamic acid ester as described above is inhibited.</p>

The temperature at which the reaction is carried out is, for example, within the range of from 80 to 180Â° C., and in order to distill off the water formed from the system, although varying according to the reaction pressure, a temperature of from 100 to 180Â° C. is preferable. Although a high temperature is preferable for the reaction temperature to accelerate the reaction rate, since undesirable reactions such as decomposition also occur at high temperatures thereby decreasing yield, the reaction temperature is more preferably within the range of from 100 to 160Â° C. The reaction pressure is a pressure that allows water formed to be removed from the system, and the reaction is carried out at a pressure of from 20 to 1Ã10<sup>6 </sup>Pa, although varying according to the reaction temperature. There are no particular limitations on the reaction time of the dehydration reaction, and is generally from 0.001 to 50 hours, preferably from 0.01 to 10 hours and more preferably from 0.1 to 2 hours. The reaction may be terminated once the desired alkyl tin alkoxide composition has been obtained. Progression of the reaction is also determined by measuring the amount of water extracted outside the system, and can also be determined by a method using <sup>119</sup>Sn-NMR by sampling the reaction liquid. In order to produce the mixture of the present embodiment in step 1, the reaction is terminated after confirming the obtaining of a composition in which the molar ratio of tetraalkyl dialkoxy distannoxane and dialkyl tin dialkoxide contained in the alkyl tin alkoxide composition obtained in the above reaction, when expressed as the combined molar ratio of both, is within the range of from 0:100 to 80:20 and more preferably within the range of from 10:90 to 70:30. The alcohol used may be used while still present in the reaction system, and the alcohol may also be used by distilling off the alcohol depending on the case. Since there is the advantage of being able to reduce the size of the reaction vessels of the other steps, it is preferable to remove as much of the alcohol as possible. Removal by known distillation is preferable for the removal method, and known distillation equipment can be used for the distiller used for distillation. A thin film distillation apparatus is preferably used for the distillation apparatus since the alcohol can be removed in a short period of time. There are no particular limitations on the type of reaction vessel of the dehydration reaction, and the known tank type or the column type reaction vessel can be used. A low boiling point reaction mixture containing water is extracted in gaseous form from the reaction vessel by distillation, while a high boiling point reaction mixture containing a produced alkyl tin alkoxide or alkyl tin alkoxide mixture is extracted in the form of a liquid from the lower portion of the reaction vessel. Various known methods are used for such a reaction vessel, examples of which may include types using reaction vessels containing a stirring tank, a multistage stirring tank, a distillation column, a multistage distillation column, a multitubular reactor, a continuous multistage distillation column, a packed column, a thin film distillation apparatus, a reactor provided with a support inside, a forced circulation reactor, a falling film evaporator, a falling drop evaporator, a trickle flow reactor or a bubble column, and types using combinations thereof. Methods using a columnar reactor are preferable from the viewpoint of efficiently shifting the equilibrium to the products side, while a structure having a large gas-liquid contact area is preferable for being able to rapidly transfer the water formed to the gaseous phase. Although continuous methods using a multitubular reactor, a multistage distillation column or a packed column packed with a packing can also be used, since the dialkyl tin oxide used in this step is generally a solid, it is preferable to employ a method in which the reaction is first carried out in a tank-type reaction vessel followed by increasing the content of dialkyl tin dialkoxide in a column-type reaction vessel. Although known materials may be used for the materials of the reaction vessel and lines provided they do not have a detrimental effect, materials such as SUS304, SUS316 or SUS316L are inexpensive and can be used preferably.

The reaction time may be within the range of from several seconds to 100 hours, and in consideration of productivity and the like, is preferably from several minutes to 10 hours. A known tank type reaction vessel or a column type reaction vessel can be used for the reaction vessel. In addition, a plurality of reaction vessels may be used in combination. Since the reaction is a reaction between carbon dioxide gas (gas) and an alkyl tin alkoxide composition (liquid), in order to carry out the reaction efficiently, it is preferable to increase the contact surface area between the gas and liquid by increasing the gas-liquid interface. Known findings can be used for the method for reacting while increasing the gas-liquid interface in this manner, and examples of preferable methods thereof may include increasing the stirring speed or generating bubbles in the liquid in the case of a tank type reaction vessel, and using a packed column or using a plate column in the case of a column type reaction vessel.

Since the reaction is generally an exothermic reaction, the reaction vessel may be cooled or it may be cooled by dissipation of heat there from. Alternatively, the reaction vessel may also be heated if the purpose is combining with a carbonic acid esterification reaction. A known method such as a method using a heat jacket or a method using an internal coil can be used to heat and cool the reaction vessel. The carbon dioxide gas and alkyl tin alkoxide composition supplied to the reaction vessel may be supplied separately to the reaction vessel or they may be mixed prior to supplying to the reaction vessel. These components may also be supplied from a plurality of locations in the reaction vessel. Completion of the reaction can be determined by, for example, <sup>119</sup>Sn-NMR analysis.</p>

The reaction is terminated after the desired carbonic acid ester has formed in the reaction vessel. Progression of the reaction can be confirmed by, for example, sampling the reaction liquid in the reaction vessel, and analyzing the carbonic acid ester formed by a method such as <sup>1</sup>H-NMR or gas chromatography. For example, the reaction may be terminated after the carbonic acid ester has been formed at a molar ratio of 10% or more of the dialkyl tin alkoxide and/or carbon dioxide associate of the dialkyl tin alkoxide contained in the dialkyl tin alkoxide and/or carbon dioxide associate of the dialkyl tin alkoxide, and in the case of desiring to increase the yield of the carbonic acid ester, the reaction may be terminated after allowing to continue until the value reaches 90% or more. A known reaction vessel can be used for the reaction vessel, and a column type reaction vessel or a tank type reaction vessel can be used preferably.

Although varying according to the boiling point and pressure of the carbonic acid ester, the temperature in this step is within the range of from a normal temperature (e.g., 20Â° C.) to 200Â° C., and since there are cases in which denaturation of tin compounds in the distillation residue may occur or the amount of carbonic acid ester may decrease due to a reverse reaction at high temperatures, the reaction temperature is preferably within the range of from the normal temperature (e.g. 20Â° C.) to 150Â° C. Although varying according to the type of carbonic acid ester and temperature at which the reaction is carried out, the reaction is generally carried out at normal pressure to reduced pressure conditions, and in consideration of productivity, the pressure is more preferably within the range of from 100 Pa to 80 KPa and most preferably within the range of from 100 Pa to 50 KPa.

In order to produce the mixture of the present embodiment in step 1, the reaction is terminated after confirming the obtaining of a composition in which the molar ratio of tetraalkyl dialkoxy distannoxane and dialkyl tin dialkoxide contained in the alkyl tin alkoxide composition obtained in the above reaction, when expressed as the combined molar ratio of both, is within the range of from 0:100 to 80:20 and more preferably within the range of from 10:90 to 70:30. The alcohol used may be used while still present in the reaction system, and the alcohol may also be used by distilling off the alcohol depending on the case. Since there is the advantage of being able to reduce the size of the reaction vessels of the other steps, it is preferable to remove as much of the alcohol as possible. Removal by known distillation is preferable for the removal method, and known distillation equipment can be used for the distiller used for distillation. A thin film distillation apparatus is preferably used for the distillation apparatus since the alcohol can be removed in a short period of time. Differing from the alkyl tin alkoxide synthesis step, since dialkyl tin oxide normally in a solid state is not used in this step, there are few restrictions on the reaction vessel. Namely, there are no particular limitations on the type of reaction vessel of the dehydration reaction, and a known tank type or a column type reaction vessel can be used. A low boiling point reaction mixture containing water is extracted in gaseous form from the reaction vessel by distillation, while a high boiling point reaction mixture containing a produced alkyl tin alkoxide or alkyl tin alkoxide mixture is extracted in the form of a liquid from the lower portion of the reaction vessel. Various known methods are used for such a reaction vessel, examples of which may include types using reaction vessels containing a stirring tank, a multistage stirring tank, a distillation column, a multistage distillation column, a multitubular reactor, a continuous multistage distillation column, a packed column, a thin film evaporator, a reactor provided with a support inside, a forced circulation reactor, a falling film evaporator, a falling drop evaporator, a trickle flow reactor or a bubble column, and types using combinations thereof. Methods using a columnar reactor are preferable from the viewpoint of efficiently shifting the equilibrium to the products side, while a structure having a large gas-liquid contact area is preferable for being able to rapidly transfer the water formed to the gaseous phase. Continuous methods using a multitubular reactor, a multistage distillation column or a packed column packed with a packing are particularly preferable. Although known materials may be used for the materials of the reaction vessel and lines provided they do not have a detrimental effect, materials such as SUS304, SUS316 or SUS316L are inexpensive and can be used preferably. Known process apparatuses such as a flow meter, a thermometer and other measuring instruments or a reboiler, a pump or a condenser and the like may be added as necessary, a known method such as steam or a heater may be used for heating, and a known method such as air cooling, cooling water or brine can be used for cooling.</p>

      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0198">Step (3) is preferably a step for obtaining a composition containing a carbamic acid ester and an aromatic hydroxy compound by separating an alcohol and a carbonic acid ester or urea from a mixture of the mixture of step (1) or step (2) and an aromatic hydroxy compound. Although several methods can be considered as methods for carrying out this step (3), in one aspect thereof, this step is carried out in a distillation apparatus, the mixture of step (1) or step (2) is supplied to a distillation apparatus as a mixture with an aromatic hydroxy compound, alcohol and carbonic acid ester or urea is recovered from a top of the column, and the composition containing carbamic acid ester and aromatic hydroxy compound is obtained from a bottom of the column.</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0199">In addition, in another aspect thereof, a mixture obtained by separating all or a portion of the alcohol and/or a portion of the carbonic acid ester or urea from the mixture of step (1) or step (2) is mixed with an aromatic hydroxy compound, and the carbonic acid ester or urea is separated from the mixture. Namely, step (3) is carried out in a distillation apparatus, and is carried out with a process comprising the following steps (3-1) and (3-2):</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0200">step (3-1): supplying the mixture of step (1) or step (2) to a distillation apparatus, an alcohol and/or a carbonic acid ester or an urea being recovered from a top of the column, and a mixture containing the carbamic acid ester, the alcohol and/or the carbonic acid ester or the urea being recovered from a bottom of the column;</p>

      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0202">The composition containing the mixture of carbamic acid ester and aromatic hydroxy compound can also be obtained by a method in which carbamic acid ester is obtained by distillative separation of carbonic acid ester and alcohol or the urea and alcohol are separated from a reaction liquid obtained by producing a carbamic acid ester, followed by mixing with the mixture of the carbamic acid ester and aromatic hydroxy compound. However, in this method, during distillative separation, for example, thermal denaturation of carbamic acid ester occurs easily as a result of dimerization, oligomerization and the like due to the occurrence of decarboxylation reactions between ester groups of the carbamic acid ester as indicated in formula (2) above, which not only causes a decrease in the yield of carbamic acid ester, but also results in the problem of polymeric deposits accumulating in the reaction vessel where the distillative separation is carried out, thereby impairing long-term operation. As a result of conducting extensive studies to resolve this problem, the inventors of the present invention found that the carbamic acid ester thermal denaturation reaction as described above can be inhibited by carrying out distillative separation of the carbonic acid ester and the alcohol or the urea and the alcohol from a reaction liquid obtained by producing carbamic acid ester in the presence of the previously described aromatic hydroxy compound, and recovering as a mixture of carbamic acid ester and aromatic hydroxy compound, thereby solving the above problem. Although the mechanism by which thermal denaturation of carbamic acid ester is inhibited is not clear, the inventors of the present invention presumed that, for example, the ester groups of the carbamic acid ester form hydrogen bonds with the aromatic hydroxy compound, thereby inhibiting ester groups of the carbamic acid ester from approaching each other due to the presence of the hydrogen bonds, which in turn inhibits the decarboxylation reaction between ester groups of the carbamic acid ester.</p>

However, in consideration of the size of the apparatus in which the distillative separation is carried out and the amount of heat required by the distillative separation, the molar ratio is more preferably within the range of from 1:0.2 to 1:300 and even more preferably within the range of from 1:0.3 to 1:30, and can be determined while taking into consideration the ratio of the number of moles of the ester groups of carbamic acid ester in the finally obtained composition of the present embodiment and the number of mole of aromatic hydroxy compound, as well as the amount of aromatic hydroxy compound distilled during distillative separation.</p>

Step (5) can be carried out by a method in which isocyanate is produced by subjecting the carbamic acid ester contained in the composition to a thermal decomposition reaction in the presence of the aromatic hydroxy compound contained in the composition, a method in which isocyanate is produced by obtaining the aryl carbamate having a group derived from an aromatic hydroxy compound by reacting carbamic acid ester contained in the composition with the aromatic hydroxy compound contained in the composition, followed by subjecting the aryl carbamate to a thermal decomposition reaction, or a method that combines these methods. The following provides an explanation of step (5). Step (5) can be carried out by the two methods indicated below.</p>
      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="2">&lt;Direct Method&gt;</heading>
      <p id="p-00241-en" num="0213">As a first method for carrying out step (5), a method is explained in which isocyanate is produced by subjecting the carbamic acid ester contained in the composition to a thermal decomposition reaction in the presence of the aromatic hydroxy compound contained in the composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00242-en" num="0214">The thermal decomposition reaction mainly contains a reaction that forms a corresponding isocyanate and hydroxy compound (alcohol or aromatic hydroxy compound derived from a carbamic acid ester) from a carbamic acid ester, and is carried out in the presence of an aromatic hydroxy compound as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00243-en" num="0215">Although reaction conditions vary according to the compounds used, the stoichiometric ratio of the amount of aromatic hydroxy compound used to the carbamic acid ester used is preferably from 1 to 100 times. Although it is preferable to use a large amount of aromatic hydroxy compound to inhibit side reactions as previously described, in consideration of the size of the reaction vessel and the like, the stoichiometric ratio is more preferably from 2 to 80 times and even more preferably from 2 to 50 times. An aromatic hydroxy compound of the same type as the aromatic hydroxy compound contained in the composition may be further added during the thermal decomposition reaction, and the thermal decomposition reaction may also be carried out by adding the aromatic hydroxy compound of a different type from the aromatic hydroxy compound contained in the composition in consideration of separation of the isocyanate formed, the hydroxy compound and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00244-en" num="0216">The reaction temperature is generally within the range of from 100 to 400Â° C., and although a high temperature is preferable for increasing the reaction rate, since side reactions as described above may be conversely caused by the carbamic acid ester and/or the product in the form of the isocyanate, the reaction temperature is preferably within the range of from 130 to 300Â° C. and more preferably within the range of from 150 to 250Â° C. A known cooling apparatus or heating apparatus may be installed in the reaction vessel to maintain a constant reaction temperature. In addition, although varying according to the types of compounds used and reaction temperature, the reaction pressure may be a decreased pressure, a normal pressure or an increased pressure, and the reaction is generally carried out at a pressure within the range of from 20 to 1Ã10<sup>6 </sup>Pa. There are no particular limitations on the reaction time (residence time in the case of a continuous method) and is generally from 0.001 to 100 hours, preferably from 0.01 to 50 hours and more preferably from 0.1 to 30 hours. A catalyst can be used in the present embodiment, and the catalyst is used at 0.01 to 30% by weight and preferably at 0.5 to 20% by weight based on the weight of the aryl carbamate. For example, organic metal catalysts such as dibutyl tin dilaurate, lead octoate or stannous octoate, or amines such as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane, triethylenediamine or triethylamine are suitable for use as catalysts, while organic metal catalysts such as dibutyl tin dilaurate, lead octoate or stannous octoate are particularly preferable. These compounds may be used alone or two or more types may be used as a mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00245-en" num="0217">A solvent can also be used in the present embodiment, and although examples of solvents that can be used may include alkanes such as pentane (including isomers), hexane (including isomers), heptane (including isomers), octane (including isomers), nonane (including isomers) or decane (including isomers); aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene (including isomers), ethyl benzene, diisopropyl benzene (including isomers), dibutyl benzene (including isomers) or naphthalene; nitrile compounds such as acetonitrile or benzonitrile; aromatic compounds substituted with a halogen or nitro group such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene (including isomers), bromobenzene, dibromobenzene (including isomers), chloronaphthalene, bromonaphthalene, nitrobenzene or nitronaphthalene; polycyclic hydrocarbon compounds such as diphenyl, substituted diphenyl, diphenyl methane, terphenyl, anthracene or dibenzyl toluene (including isomers); aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cyclopentane, cyclooctane or ethylcyclohexane; alicyclic alcohols such as cyclohexanol, cyclopentanol or cyclooctanol; ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone or acetophenone; esters such as dibutyl phthalate, dihexyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzylbutyl phthalate; ethers and thioethers such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, diphenyl ether or diphenyl sulfide; ketone compounds such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone; ester compounds such as ethyl acetate or ethyl benzoate; and, sulfoxides such as dimethylsulfoxide or diphenylsulfoxide, based on the complexity of the procedure during separation and recovery of the hydroxy compound, the carbamic acid ester thermal decomposition reaction is preferably carried out without using a solvent.</p>
      <p id="p-00246-en" num="0218">As was previously described, although the thermal decomposition reaction of the present embodiment is a reaction by which a corresponding isocyanate and a hydroxy compound are formed from the carbamic acid ester, the thermal decomposition reaction is an equilibrium reaction. Thus, in order to efficiently obtain isocyanate in this thermal decomposition reaction, it is preferable to remove at least one of the products of this thermal decomposition reaction in the form of the isocyanate and the hydroxy compound from the thermal decomposition reaction system in the form of a gaseous component by a method such as distillation. Whether the isocyanate or hydroxy compound is removed as a gaseous component can be arbitrarily determined according to the compounds used, and for example, the respective normal boiling points of the isocyanate and the hydroxy compound are compared followed by removing the compound having the lower normal boiling point in the form of a gaseous component.</p>
      <p id="p-00247-en" num="0219">The thermal decomposition reaction is preferably carried out by a continuous method. A continuous method refers to a method in which the carbamic acid ester is continuously supplied to a reaction vessel where it is subjected to a thermal decomposition reaction, and at least either the formed isocyanate or hydroxy compound is removed from the reaction vessel in the form of a gaseous component, while a portion or all of the liquid containing the carbamic acid ester and/or aromatic hydroxy compound is removed from the bottom of the reaction vessel.</p>
      <p id="p-00248-en" num="0220">In the case of carrying out the carbamic acid ester thermal decomposition reaction using a continuous method, the carbamic acid ester is supplied to the reaction vessel where the thermal decomposition reaction is carried out in the form of a composition with an aromatic hydroxy compound of the present embodiment. Although there are many cases in which the carbamic acid ester is a solid at normal temperatures (e.g., 25Â° C.), since there many cases in which the composition of the present embodiment is a liquid, there are many cases in which it is advantageous in terms of continuously supplying to the reaction vessel. In addition, since there are many case in which it is advantageous for the composition of the present embodiment to have a low viscosity when transferring the composition to the reaction vessel, there are many cases in which the composition is supplied to the reaction vessel while maintaining at a certain temperature (for example, 130Â° C.). Although side reactions occur as described above ultimately leading to a decrease in the yield of isocyanate if the carbamic acid ester is held at these temperature conditions for a long period of time, the inventors of the present invention surprisingly found that the composition of the present embodiment is resistant to the occurrence of such side reactions even if held under such temperature conditions for a long period of time. Although the mechanism by which these aromatic hydroxy compounds inhibit side reactions is not clear, as previously described, the inventors of the present invention presumed that, as a result of an aromatic hydroxy compound forming hydrogen bonds between urethane bonds (âNHCOOâ) of the carbamic acid ester and the aromatic hydroxy compound, a state is formed in which the urethane bonds have difficulty in approaching each other, thereby making it difficult for a reaction that forms urea bonds to occur as in, for example, a reaction that forms urea bonds represented by the above-mentioned formula (2).</p>
      <p id="p-00249-en" num="0221">Although known materials may be used for the reaction vessel and lines used to carry out the thermal decomposition reaction provided they do not have a detrimental effect on the carbamic acid ester or the products in the form of the hydroxy compound and isocyanate, SUS304, SUS316 or SUS316L and the like can be used preferably since they are inexpensive. There are no particular limitations on the type of reaction vessel, and a known tank type reaction vessel or a column type reaction vessel can be used. A reaction vessel is preferably used that is provided with lines for extracting a low boiling point mixture containing at least either the isocyanate or the hydroxy compound formed in the thermal decomposition reaction from the reaction vessel in the form of a gaseous component, and for removing all or a portion of a mixed liquid containing unreacted carbamic acid ester and compounds not extracted in the form of a gaseous component from the lower portion of the reaction vessel. Various known methods are used for such a reaction vessel, examples of which may include types using reaction vessels containing a stirring tank, a multistage stirring tank, a distillation column, a multistage distillation column, a multitubular reactor, a continuous multistage distillation column, a packed column, a thin film evaporator, a reactor provided with a support inside, a forced circulation reactor, a falling film evaporator, a falling drop evaporator, a trickle flow reactor or a bubble column, and types using combinations thereof. Methods using a thin film evaporator or a columnar reaction vessel are preferable from the viewpoint of rapidly removing the low boiling point component from the reaction system, while a structure having a large gas-liquid contact area is preferable for rapidly transferring the low boiling point component formed to the gaseous phase.</p>
      <p id="p-00250-en" num="0222">The reaction vessel is preferably provided with a line for supplying the carbamic acid ester, a line for extracting a gaseous component containing at least either the isocyanate or the hydroxy compound formed by the thermal decomposition reaction, and a line for extracting a mixed liquid containing compounds not removed as a gaseous component and unreacted carbamic acid ester, and the line for extracting the gaseous component containing at least either the isocyanate or hydroxy compound is preferably located at a location that allows the gaseous component in the reaction vessel to be extracted, and the line for extracting the mixed liquid containing compounds not removed as a gaseous component, unreacted carbamic acid ester and the aromatic hydroxy compound is particularly preferably located there below.</p>
      <p id="p-00251-en" num="0223">In addition, a line for supplying inert gas and/or liquid inert solvent from the lower portion of the reaction vessel may be separately attached, and a line may also be attached for recirculating all or a portion of the mixed liquid containing unreacted carbamic acid ester and/or active hydrogen extracted from the bottom of the reaction vessel. Equipment for warming, cooling or heating may be added to each line in consideration of clogging and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00252-en" num="0224">Although there are many cases in which the gaseous component removed from the thermal decomposition reaction, and/or the mixed liquid containing compounds not removed as a gaseous component, unreacted carbamic acid ester and aromatic hydroxy compound containing aromatic hydroxy compounds and/or alcohols in the form of compounds other than isocyanates, among these compounds, the aromatic hydroxy compound can be reused as the aromatic hydroxy compound of step (3). On the other hand, the alcohol can be reused as the alcohol used in production of the dialkyl tin compound of step (A) in the process for producing carbonic acid ester, and the alcohol can also be reused during production of carbamic acid ester from an amine compound, alcohol and urea.</p>

      <p id="p-00253-en" num="0225">A method is explained for the second method of step (5) for producing isocyanate by reacting the carbamic acid ester contained in the composition of step (4) with the aromatic hydroxy compound contained in the composition to obtain the aryl carbamate having a group derived from the aromatic hydroxy compound followed by subjecting the aryl carbamate to a thermal decomposition reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00254-en" num="0226">This process comprises the following steps (5-1) and (5-2):</p>
      <p id="p-00255-en" num="0227">step (5-1): reacting the carbamic acid ester and aromatic hydroxy compound which are contained in the composition of step (4), a low boiling point component formed being recovered in a form of a gaseous component, and a reaction liquid containing the aryl carbamate and the aromatic hydroxy compound being removed from a bottom of the reaction vessel in which the reaction occurs, and</p>
      <p id="p-00256-en" num="0228">step (5-2): supplying the reaction liquid of step (5-1) to a reaction vessel in which a thermal decomposition reaction occurs, the aryl carbamate being subjected to a thermal decomposition reaction, at least one of either an isocyanate or an aromatic hydroxy compound which are formed being recovered in a form of a gaseous component, and all or a portion of a mixture containing the isocyanate and/or the aromatic hydroxy compound and/or the aryl carbamate not recovered in a form of a gaseous component being recovered from the bottom of the reaction vessel.</p>
      <p id="p-00257-en" num="0229">&lt;Step (5-1)&gt;</p>
      <p id="p-00258-en" num="0230">In step (5-1), the carbamic acid ester and the aromatic hydroxy compound are reacted to obtain the aryl carbamate having a group derived from the aromatic hydroxy compound. In this reaction, an ester group of the carbamic acid ester is replaced with an aryloxy group derived from the aromatic hydroxy compound resulting in the formation of the corresponding aryl carbamate and a hydroxy compound derived from the carbamic acid ester (also referred to as a âtransesterification reactionâ in the present description).</p>
      <p id="p-00259-en" num="0231">Although varying according to the reacted compounds, the reaction conditions of this transesterification reaction are such that the aromatic hydroxy compound is used within the range of from 2 to 1000 times the ester group of the carbamic acid ester when expressed as the stoichiometric ratio. As a result of conducting extensive studies, the inventors of the present invention surprisingly found that by using an aromatic hydroxy compound having a substituent at at least one ortho position with respect to the hydroxyl group in this transesterification reaction as previously described, side reactions as previously described attributable to the carbamic acid ester and/or product in the form of the aryl carbamate can be inhibited in the transesterification reaction. In the transesterification reaction, although the aromatic hydroxy compound is preferably used in excess with respect to the ester group of the carbamic acid ester in order to inhibit side reactions attributable to the carbamic acid ester and/or product in the form of the aryl carbamate as well as allow the reaction to be completed quickly, the aromatic hydroxy compound is preferably used within the range of from 2 to 100 times and preferably within the range of from 5 to 50 times in consideration of the size of the reaction vessel.</p>
      <p id="p-00260-en" num="0232">During the transesterification reaction, an aromatic hydroxy compound of the same type as the aromatic hydroxy compound contained in the composition may be further added, or the thermal decomposition reaction may be carried out by adding a different type of aromatic hydroxy compound from the aromatic hydroxy compound contained in the composition in consideration of separation of the resulting isocyanate, hydroxy compound and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00261-en" num="0233">The reaction temperature is generally within the range of from 100 to 300Â° C., and although high temperatures are preferable in order to increase the reaction rate, since there conversely may be greater susceptibility to the occurrence of side reactions at high temperatures, the reaction temperature is preferably within the range of from 150 to 250Â° C. A known cooling apparatus or heating apparatus may be installed in the reaction vessel to maintain a constant reaction temperature. In addition, although varying according to the types of compounds used and reaction temperature, the reaction pressure may be a decreased pressure, a normal pressure or an increased pressure, and the reaction is generally carried out at a pressure within the range of from 20 to 1Ã10<sup>6 </sup>Pa. There are no particular limitations on the reaction time (residence time in the case of a continuous method) and is generally from 0.001 to 100 hours, preferably from 0.01 to 50 hours and more preferably from 0.1 to 30 hours. In addition, the reaction can also be completed by confirming that a desired amount of aryl carbamate has been formed by, for example, liquid chromatography after sampling the reaction liquid. In the present embodiment, the catalyst is used at 0.01 to 30% by weight and preferably at 0.5 to 20% by weight based on the weight of the carbamic acid ester. For example, organic metal catalysts such as dibutyl tin dilaurate, lead octoate or stannous octoate, or amines such as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane, triethylenediamine or triethylamine are suitable for use, while organic metal catalysts such as dibutyl tin dilaurate, lead octoate or stannous octoate are particularly preferable. These compounds may be used alone or two or more types may be used as a mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00262-en" num="0234">Although the use of a reaction solvent is not necessarily required in the present embodiment, a suitable inert solvent is preferably used as a reaction solvent for the purpose of facilitating the reaction procedure, examples of which may include alkanes such as hexane (including isomers), heptane (including isomers), octane (including isomers), nonane (including isomers) or decane (including isomers); aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene (including isomers), ethyl benzene, diisopropyl benzene (including isomers), dibutyl benzene (including isomers) or naphthalene; aromatic compounds substituted with a halogen or nitro group such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene (including isomers), bromobenzene, dibromobenzene (including isomers), chloronaphthalene, bromonaphthalene, nitrobenzene or nitronaphthalene; polycyclic hydrocarbon compounds such as diphenyl, substituted diphenyl, diphenyl methane, terphenyl, anthracene or dibenzyl toluene (including isomers); aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cyclopentane, cyclooctane or ethylcyclohexane; ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone or acetophenone; esters such as dibutyl phthalate, dihexyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzylbutyl phthalate; ethers and thioethers such as diphenyl ether or diphenyl sulfide; and sulfoxides such as dimethylsulfoxide or diphenylsulfoxide; and, silicone oil. These solvents can be used alone or two or more types can be used as a mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00263-en" num="0235">As has been previously described, although the transesterification reaction in the present embodiment involves an exchange between an ester group of the carbamic acid ester and an aryloxy group derived from the aromatic hydroxy compound resulting in the formation of the corresponding aryl carbamate and an alcohol, the transesterification reaction is an equilibrium reaction. Thus, in order to efficiently produce the aryl carbamate by this transesterification reaction, it is preferable to remove the products from the reaction system. Since the compound having the lowest normal boiling point in the reaction system is the alcohol formed by the transesterification reaction, the alcohol is preferably removed from the reaction system by a method such as distillative separation.</p>
      <p id="p-00264-en" num="0236">In addition, the transesterification reaction is preferably carried out by a continuous method to allow the transesterification reaction to proceed efficiently. Namely, a method is preferably used in which the carbamic acid ester and the aromatic hydroxy compound are supplied continuously to the reaction vessel to carry out the transesterification reaction, the alcohol formed is removed from the reaction vessel in the form of a gaseous component, and a reaction liquid containing the formed aryl carbamate and the aromatic hydroxy compound is continuously removed from the bottom of the reaction vessel. In the case of carrying out the transesterification reaction according to this method, in addition to promoting the transesterification reaction, there is also the unexpected effect of being able to improve the final yield of isocyanate by inhibiting side reactions as previously described.</p>
      <p id="p-00265-en" num="0237">Although known materials may be used for the reaction vessel and lines used to carry out the transesterification reaction provided they do not have a detrimental effect on the starting substances or reactants, SUS304, SUS316 or SUS316L and the like can be used preferably since they are inexpensive. There are no particular limitations on the type of reaction vessel, and a known tank-type or a column-type reaction vessel can be used. A reaction vessel is preferably used that is provided with lines for extracting a low boiling point reaction mixture containing alcohol formed in the transesterification reaction from the reaction vessel in the form of a gaseous component, and for extracting a mixed liquid containing the produced aryl carbamate and aromatic hydroxy compound from the lower portion of the reaction vessel in the form of a liquid. Various known methods are used for such a reaction vessel, examples of which may include types using reaction vessels containing a stirring tank, a multistage stirring tank, a distillation column, a multistage distillation column, a multitubular reactor, a continuous multistage distillation column, a packed column, a thin film evaporator, a reactor provided with a support inside, a forced circulation reactor, a falling film evaporator, a falling drop evaporator, a trickle flow reactor or a bubble column, and types using combinations thereof. Methods using a thin film evaporator or a columnar reactor are preferable from the viewpoint of efficiently shifting the equilibrium to the products side, while a structure having a large gas-liquid contact area is preferable for being able to rapidly transfer the alcohol formed to the gaseous phase.</p>
      <p id="p-00266-en" num="0238">A multistage distillation column refers to a distillation column having multiple stages in which the number of theoretical plates of distillation is 2 or more, and any multistage distillation column may be used provided it allows continuous distillation. Any multistage distillation column can be used for the multistage distillation column provided it is ordinarily used as a multistage distillation column, examples of which may include tray column types using a bubble tray, a porous plate tray, a valve tray or a counter-current tray, and packed column types packed with various types of packing materials such as a raschig ring, a lessing ring, a pole ring, a Berl saddle, an Interlock saddle, a Dixon packing, a McMahon packing, Helipack, a Sulzer packing or Mellapak. Any packed column can be used provided the column is packed with a known packing material as described above. Moreover, a combination tray-packed column type is also used preferably that combines a tray portion with a portion packed with a packing material. The reaction vessel is preferably provided with a line for supplying a mixture containing the carbamic acid ester and the aromatic hydroxy compound, a line for extracting a gaseous phase component containing alcohol formed by the transesterification reaction, and a line for extracting a mixed liquid containing the aryl carbamate and aromatic hydroxy compound, and the line for extracting the gaseous phase component containing the alcohol is preferably at a location that allows the gaseous phase component in the reaction vessel to be extracted, and the line for extracting the mixed liquid containing the aryl carbamate and the aromatic hydroxy compound is particularly preferably located there below.</p>
      <p id="p-00267-en" num="0239">A line for supplying inert gas and/or liquid inert solvent from the lower portion of the reaction vessel may be separately attached, and in the case the mixed liquid containing the formed aryl carbamate and the aromatic hydroxy compound contains unreacted carbamic acid ester, a line may be attached for recirculating all or a portion of the mixed liquid to the reaction vessel. Furthermore, in the case of using the above-mentioned inert solvent, the inert solvent may be in the form of a gas and/or a liquid.</p>

      <p id="p-00279-en" num="0247">The aryl carbamate produced in the transesterification reaction may be subjected to the subsequent thermal decomposition reaction while still as a mixed liquid containing aryl carbamate and aromatic hydroxy compound removed from the reaction vessel, or the aryl carbamate may be subjected to the thermal decomposition reaction after purifying from the mixed liquid. A known method can be used to purify the aryl carbamate from the reaction liquid, examples of which may include removal of the aromatic hydroxy compound by distillation, washing with a solvent and purification of the aryl carbamate by crystallization.</p>
      <p id="p-00280-en" num="0248">Since the aryl carbamate of the present embodiment is a carbamic acid ester composed of an aromatic hydroxy compound and an isocyanate, the thermal decomposition temperature is low as is generally known. In addition, the aryl carbamate of the present embodiment is unexpectedly extremely resistant to the occurrence of side reactions (such as a reaction resulting in the formation of a urea bond as previously described) at high temperatures (such as 200Â° C.) at which the thermal decomposition reaction is carried out. Although the mechanism by which side reactions are inhibited is unclear, as was previously described, it is presumed that a substituent at the ortho position relative to the hydroxyl group sterically protects a urethane bond, thereby hindering the reaction between a different carbamic acid ester and the urethane bond.</p>
      <p id="p-00281-en" num="0249">Moreover, although the aromatic hydroxy compound formed by the thermal decomposition reaction of the aryl carbamate of the present embodiment is an aromatic hydroxy compound having a substituent at the ortho position relative to a hydroxyl group, since the reaction rate between the aromatic hydroxy compound and isocyanate is surprisingly slow, namely the reverse reaction rate in the thermal decomposition reaction is surprisingly low, when carrying out the thermal decomposition reaction on the aryl carbamate, there is the advantage of being able to easily separate the aromatic hydroxy compound and the isocyanate.</p>

      <p id="p-00284-en" num="0252">The following provides an explanation of the aryl carbamate decomposition reaction of step (5-2).</p>
      <p id="p-00285-en" num="0253">The decomposition reaction of the present embodiment is a thermal decomposition reaction by which the corresponding isocyanate and the aromatic hydroxy compound are formed from the aryl carbamate.</p>
      <p id="p-00286-en" num="0254">The reaction temperature is generally within the range of from 100 to 300Â° C., and although a high temperature is preferable for increasing the reaction rate, since side reactions as described above may be conversely caused by the aryl carbamate and/or the reaction product in the form of the isocyanate, the reaction temperature is preferably within the range of from 150 to 250Â° C. A known cooling apparatus or heating apparatus may be installed in the reaction vessel to maintain a constant reaction temperature. In addition, although varying according to the types of compounds used and reaction temperature, the reaction pressure may be a decreased pressure, a normal pressure or an increased pressure, and the reaction is generally carried out at a pressure within the range of from 20 to 1Ã10<sup>6 </sup>Pa. There are no particular limitations on the reaction time (residence time in the case of a continuous method) and is generally from 0.001 to 100 hours, preferably from 0.01 to 50 hours and more preferably from 0.1 to 30 hours. A catalyst can be used in the present embodiment, and the catalyst is used at 0.01 to 30% by weight and preferably at 0.5 to 20% by weight based on the weight of the aryl carbamate. For example, organic metal catalysts such as dibutyl tin dilaurate, lead octoate or stannous octoate, or amines such as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane, triethylenediamine or triethylamine are suitable for use as catalysts, while organic metal catalysts such as dibutyl tin dilaurate, lead octoate or stannous octoate are particularly preferable. These compounds may be used alone or two or more types may be used as a mixture. In the case of using a catalyst in the above-mentioned transesterification reaction, the catalyst contained in the mixed liquid following the transesterification reaction may be used as a catalyst in the thermal decomposition reaction or catalyst may be freshly added to the aryl carbamate when the thermal decomposition reaction is carried out.</p>
      <p id="p-00287-en" num="0255">Although the use of a reaction solvent is not necessarily required in the present embodiment, a suitable inert solvent can be used as a reaction solvent for the purpose of facilitating the reaction procedure, examples of which may include alkanes such as hexane (including isomers), heptane (including isomers), octane (including isomers), nonane (including isomers) or decane (including isomers); aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene (including isomers), ethyl benzene, diisopropyl benzene (including isomers), dibutyl benzene (including isomers) or naphthalene; aromatic compounds substituted with a halogen or nitro group such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene (including isomers), bromobenzene, dibromobenzene (including isomers), chloronaphthalene, bromonaphthalene, nitrobenzene or nitronaphthalene; polycyclic hydrocarbon compounds such as diphenyl, substituted diphenyl, diphenyl methane, terphenyl, anthracene or dibenzyl toluene (including isomers); aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cyclopentane, cyclooctane or ethylcyclohexane; ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone or acetophenone; esters such as dibutyl phthalate, dihexyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzylbutyl phthalate; ethers and thioethers such as diphenyl ether or diphenyl sulfide; and sulfoxides such as dimethylsulfoxide or diphenylsulfoxide; and, silicone oil. These solvents can be used alone or two or more types can be used as a mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00288-en" num="0256">As was previously described, although the thermal decomposition reaction of the present embodiment is a reaction by which the corresponding isocyanate and the aromatic hydroxy compound are formed from the aryl carbamate, the thermal decomposition reaction is an equilibrium reaction. Thus, in order to efficiently obtain isocyanate in this thermal decomposition reaction, it is preferable to remove at least one of the products of this thermal decomposition reaction in the form of the isocyanate and the aromatic hydroxy compound from the thermal decomposition reaction system in the form of a gaseous component by a method such as distillation. Whether the isocyanate or the aromatic hydroxy compound is removed as a gaseous component can be arbitrarily determined according to the compounds used, and for example, the respective normal boiling points of the isocyanate and the aromatic hydroxy compound are compared followed by removing the compound having the lower normal boiling point in the form of a gaseous component.</p>
      <p id="p-00289-en" num="0257">The aryl carbamate is also susceptible to the occurrence of side reactions as described above in the case of being held at a high temperature for a long period of time, although to a much lower degree than carbamic acid ester. In addition, the above-mentioned side reactions may also be induced by the isocyanate formed by the thermal decomposition reaction. Thus, the time during which the aryl carbamate and the isocyanate are held at a high temperature is preferably as short as possible, and the thermal decomposition reaction is preferably carried out by a continuous method. A continuous method refers to a method in which the aryl carbamate is continuously supplied to the reaction vessel where it is subjected to a thermal decomposition reaction, and at least either the formed isocyanate or aromatic hydroxy compound is removed from the reaction vessel in the form of a gaseous component.</p>
      <p id="p-00290-en" num="0258">Although known materials may be used for the reaction vessel and lines used to carry out the thermal decomposition reaction provided they do not have a detrimental effect on the aryl carbamate or the products in the form of the aromatic hydroxy compound and isocyanate, SUS304, SUS316 or SUS316L and the like can be used preferably since they are inexpensive. There are no particular limitations on the type of reaction vessel, and a known tank-type reaction vessel or a column-type reaction vessel can be used. A reaction vessel is preferably used that is provided with lines for extracting a low boiling point mixture containing at least either the isocyanate or the aromatic hydroxy compound formed in the thermal decomposition reaction from the reaction vessel in the form of a gaseous component, and for removing a mixed liquid containing unreacted aryl carbamate and compounds not extracted in the form of a liquid from the lower portion of the reaction vessel. Various known methods are used for such a reaction vessel, examples of which may include types using reaction vessels containing a stirring tank, a multistage stirring tank, a distillation column, a multistage distillation column, a multitubular reactor, a continuous multistage distillation column, a packed column, a thin film evaporator, a reactor provided with a support inside, a forced circulation reactor, a falling film evaporator, a falling drop evaporator, a trickle flow reactor or a bubble column, and types using combinations thereof. Methods using a thin film evaporator or a columnar reactor are preferable from the viewpoint of rapidly removing a low boiling point component from the reaction system, while a structure having a large gas-liquid contact area is preferable for rapidly transferring the low boiling point component formed to the gaseous phase.</p>
      <p id="p-00291-en" num="0259">The reaction vessel is preferably provided with a line for supplying the aryl carbamate, a line for extracting a gaseous component containing at least either the isocyanate or the aromatic hydroxy compound formed by the thermal decomposition reaction, and a line for extracting a mixed liquid containing compounds not removed as a gaseous component and unreacted aryl carbamate, the line for extracting the gaseous component containing at least either the isocyanate or the aromatic hydroxy compound is preferably located at a location that allows the gaseous component in the reaction vessel to be extracted, and the line for extracting the mixed liquid containing compounds not removed as a gaseous component and unreacted aryl carbamate is particularly preferably located there below.</p>
      <p id="p-00292-en" num="0260">In addition, a line for supplying inert gas and/or liquid inert solvent from the lower portion of the reaction vessel may be separately attached, and a line may also be attached for recirculating all or a portion of the mixed liquid containing unreacted aryl carbamate and compounds not removed as a gaseous component to the reaction vessel. Equipment for warming, cooling or heating may be added to each line in consideration of clogging and the like. Furthermore, in the case of using the above-mentioned inert solvent, the inert solvent may be in the form of a gas and/or a liquid.</p>
      <p id="p-00293-en" num="0261">The aromatic hydroxy compound obtained in the thermal decomposition reaction can be reused as the aromatic hydroxy compound in step (3) in the process for producing the composition of the present embodiment. When reusing the aromatic hydroxy compound, the aromatic hydroxy compound may be reused after purifying by a known method such as distillative purification. In addition, the entire amount of the aromatic hydroxy compound obtained in the thermal decomposition reaction may be reused or only a portion thereof may be reused.</p>
      <p id="p-00294-en" num="0262">Table 1 is a table showing the process flow of an example of a modified process for producing isocyanate combining the composition of the present embodiment, a step for producing carbonic acid ester and the composition using the carbonic acid ester, a step for producing isocyanate using the composition, and the reuse of alcohol and/or aromatic hydroxy compound obtained in each step.  </p>
      <p id="p-00295-en" num="0263">A mixture is produced containing the carbonic acid ester produced by going through steps (A) and (B) and the carbamic ester in step (1) using amine compounds. The excess carbonic acid ester and by-product alcohol contained in this mixture are subjected to distillative separation in step (3) in the presence of aromatic hydroxy compound to obtain the composition of the present embodiment containing carbamic acid ester and the aromatic hydroxy compound. The alcohol is reused as the alcohol in the regeneration step of the dialkyl tin compound of step (C), while the carbonic acid ester is reused as the carbonic acid ester of step (1). Next, although isocyanate is produced using the composition of the present embodiment obtained in step (3), the production of isocyanate may be carried out by a method in which isocyanate is produced by subjecting the composition to a transesterification reaction as previously described, by a method in which isocyanate is produced by producing the aryl carbamate by subjecting the composition to a transesterification reaction and then subjecting the aryl carbamate to a thermal decomposition reaction, or by a method that combines both. In the isocyanate production step, the alcohol derived from the separated carbamic acid ester and the aromatic hydroxy compound are reused in the dialkyl tin compound regeneration step of step (C) and the step for producing the composition containing the carbamic acid ester and the aromatic hydroxy compound of step (3), respectively. They may also be subjected to a purification step and the like in addition to the steps described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00296-en" num="0264">The composition of the present embodiment as described above is a composition suitable for transfer and storage of carbamic acid ester, and this composition enables reductions in yield of carbamic acid ester caused by thermal denaturation and the like to be inhibited. In addition, the composition can also be used in the production of isocyanate, and isocyanate produced with this composition can be preferably used as a production raw material of polyurethane foam, paints, adhesives and the like, thereby making it extremely important industrially.</p>

      <p id="p-00317-en" num="0285">625 g (2.7 mol) of di-n-butyl tin oxide (Sankyo Organic Chemicals Co., Ltd., Japan) and 2020 g (22.7 mol) of 3-methyl-1-butanol (Kuraray Co., Ltd., Japan) were placed in a 5000 mL volumetric pear-shaped flask. The flask was connected to an evaporator (R-144, Shibata Co., Ltd., Japan) to which was connected an oil bath (OBH-24, Masuda Corp., Japan) equipped with a temperature controller, a vacuum pump (G-50A, Ulvac Inc., Japan) and a vacuum controller (VC-10S, Okano Seisakusho Co., Ltd.). The purge valve outlet of this evaporator was connected to a line containing nitrogen gas flowing at normal pressure. After closing the purge valve of the evaporator to reduce pressure inside the system, the purge valve was opened gradually to allow nitrogen to flow into the system and return to normal pressure. The oil bath temperature was set to about 145Â° C., the flask was immersed in the oil bath and rotation of the evaporator was started. After heating for about 40 minutes in the presence of atmospheric pressure nitrogen with the purge valve of the evaporator left open, distillation of 3-methyl-1-butanol containing water began. After maintaining in this state for 7 hours, the purge valve was closed, pressure inside the system was gradually reduced, and excess 3-methyl-1-butanol was distilled with the pressure inside the system at 74 to 35 kPa. After the fraction no longer appeared, the flask was taken out of the oil bath. After allowing the flask to cool to the vicinity of room temperature (25Â° C.), the flask was taken out of the oil bath, the purge valve was opened gradually and the pressure inside the system was returned to atmospheric pressure. 1173 g of reaction liquid were obtained in the flask.

The flask was connected to an evaporator (R-144, Shibata Co., Ltd., Japan) to which was connected an oil bath (OBH-24, Masuda Corp., Japan) equipped with a temperature controller, a vacuum pump (G-50A, ULVAC Inc., Japan) and a vacuum controller (VC-10S, Okano Seisakusho Co., Ltd.). The purge valve outlet of this evaporator was connected to a line containing nitrogen gas flowing at normal pressure. After closing the purge valve of the evaporator to reduce pressure inside the system, the purge valve was opened gradually to allow nitrogen to flow into the system and return to normal pressure. The oil bath temperature was set to about 145Â° C., the flask was immersed in the oil bath and rotation of the evaporator was started. After heating for about 40 minutes in the presence of atmospheric pressure nitrogen with the purge valve of the evaporator left open, distillation of 3-methyl-1-butanol containing water began. After maintaining in this state for 7 hours, the purge valve was closed, pressure inside the system was gradually reduced, and excess 3-methyl-1-butanol was distilled with the pressure inside the system at 74 to 35 kPa. After the fraction no longer appeared, the flask was taken out of the oil bath. After allowing the flask to cool to the vicinity of room temperature (25Â° C.), the flask was taken out of the oil bath, the purge valve was opened gradually and the pressure inside the system was returned to atmospheric pressure. 1290 g of reaction liquid were obtained in the flask.
