    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to an adhesive agent which is used in bonding or direct electrical connection of a semiconductor chip such as LSI, LED or laser diode to a circuit board such as a flexible substrate, a glass epoxy substrate, a glass substrate, a ceramic substrate or a silicon interposer, or in bonding or lamination between semiconductor chips.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In recent years, flip chip assembly has received attention and has been rapidly spreading as a technique for mounting a semiconductor chip on a circuit board associated with downsizing and density growth of semiconductor devices. In flip chip assembly, an epoxy resin-based adhesive agent is generally interposed between a semiconductor chip and a circuit board to ensure the connection reliability of joints between bump electrodes formed on the semiconductor chip and pad electrodes of the circuit board. Particularly, adhesive agents containing a polyimide resin, an epoxy resin, and inorganic particles are being frequently used for various applications such as electrical and electronic applications, architecture, automobiles, and airplanes by virtue of the heat resistance and insulation properties of the polyimide resin, the adhesiveness and water resistance of the epoxy resin, and the low water absorbency and low thermal expansibility of the inorganic particles (for example, Patent Documents 1 to 3).</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Further, when metal electrodes of the semiconductor chip and the circuit board are solder welded, a flux material is used. A main function of the flux material is to make a solder joint clean, to prevent oxidation of a metal, and to enhance solder wettability. As the flux material, rosin-based materials are known (e.g., Patent Documents 4 and 5).</p>

    <heading id="h-00005-en">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <heading id="h-00006-en">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In the case of a conventional adhesive agent, in flip chip assembly, a hardening reaction proceeds gradually due to heating for removing a water content by moisture absorption or heating in a semiconductor chip assembly process, and therefore there is a case where unstable electrical connection is caused because bump electrodes of a semiconductor chip are less likely to penetrate the adhesive agent or there is a case where connection reliability is poor because air bubbles are trapped in the adhesive agent. Further, there is a case where the adhesive agent is fluidized due to the aforementioned heating and becomes irregular in its thickness to cause poor connection reliability. Moreover, a semiconductor device produced using such a conventional adhesive agent also has a problem in that it may be difficult to maintain sufficient connection reliability when the semiconductor device is subjected to a process where higher durability is required such as a moisture absorption-reflow process or a thermal cycle process.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In order to solve these problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide an adhesive agent which has excellent storage life in heating conditions of a heat-drying process and an assembly process.</p>
    <heading id="h-00007-en">SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS</heading>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present invention pertains to an adhesive agent comprising a polyimide (a), an epoxy compound (b), and an acid-modified rosin (c).</p>
    <heading id="h-00008-en">EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">According to the present invention, an adhesive agent is provided which has excellent stability against heating treatment during a heat-drying process and an assembly process.</p>
    <heading id="h-00009-en">EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The adhesive agent of the present invention is an adhesive agent comprising a polyimide (a), an epoxy compound (b), and an acid-modified rosin (c).</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The adhesive agent of the present invention contains the polyimide (a), and is therefore excellent in heat resistance and chemical resistance. Particularly, a hardened article having a higher-density network structure can be obtained by using a polyimide having, in its side chain, at least one highly polar functional group selected from the group consisting of a phenolic hydroxyl group, a sulfonic acid group, and a thiol group since the solubility in an organic solvent and the compatibility with an epoxy resin of polyimide are improved and a ring-opening reaction of the epoxy compound and an addition reaction to another organic-solvent-soluble polyimide are accelerated during heat treatment. A method for synthesizing such a polyimide is not limited to the following examples, and an example thereof is a method in which a diamine having a highly polar functional group such as a phenolic hydroxyl group, a sulfonic acid group, and a thiol group is first reacted with an acid dianhydride to synthesize a polyimide precursor, and then the polyimide precursor is subjected to end modification using a primary monoamine as a terminal blocking agent, and is then subjected to heat treatment at 150Â°C or higher to perform polyimide cyclization. Alternatively, the following method may be used. An acid dianhydride is reacted with a primary monoamine as a terminal blocking agent in advance, and then a diamine having a functional group is added to synthesize an end-modified polyimide precursor, and the polyimide precursor is subjected to heat treatment at a high temperature of 150Â°C or higher to perform polyimide cyclization.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">It is to be noted that the polyimide (a) used in the present invention is desirably an organic-solvent-soluble polyimide which is dissolved in at least one solvent selected from the following solvents in an amount of 20 mass% or more at 23Â°C since the coating properties of the resulting adhesive agent varnish are enhanced. Examples of the solvents include ketone-based solvents such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclopentanone, and cyclohexanone; ether-based solvents such as 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, and diglyme; glycol ether-based solvents such as methyl cellosolve, ethyl cellosolve, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monoethyl ether, propylene glycol monobutyl ether, and diethylene glycol methyl ethyl ether; and other solvents such as benzyl alcohol, N-methylpyrrolidone, Î³-butyrolactone, ethyl acetate, and N,N-dimethylformamide.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">A preferred example of the polyimide (a) is a polymer having a structure represented by a general formula (2) or a general formula (3) and containing a structure represented by a general formula (1) in an amount of 5 to 15% by mass with respect to the total amount of the polymer as R<sup>4</sup> in the general formula (2) or the general formula (3). By setting the content of a structure represented by the general formula (1) contained in the polymer to 5% by mass or more, it is possible to impart solubility in an organic solvent and appropriate flexibility to a polyimide. By setting the content to 15% by mass or less, it is possible to maintain the rigidity of a polyimide and secure heat resistance and insulation properties.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">It is to be noted that the total amount of the polymer (polyimide) obtained by synthesis of the polyimide refers to the weight of a polymer obtained by polymerization using a diamine, an acid dianhydride, and a terminal blocking agent as its constituents. The total amount of the polyimide does not include the weights of an excess of the diamine, an excess of the acid dianhydride, and an excess of the terminal blocking agent which have been fed during synthesis but not polymerized to a polymer. <chemistry id="chem-00001-en" num="0001"><img id="img-00001-en" wi="103" he="38" img-content="chem" file="EP2940094A1_00001.PNG" img-format="png" original="imgb0001.tif" /></chemistry></p>

Further, 20 to 90 mol% of the total of R<sup>5</sup>s and R<sup>6</sup>s are preferably groups selected from the group consisting of phenolic hydroxyl groups, sulfonic acid groups, and thiol groups.

    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">In the general formulas (2) and (3), X represents a monovalent organic group and is a residue of a primary monoamine which is a terminal blocking agent. Herein, examples of the primary monoamine include an aliphatic monoamine, an alicyclic monoamine, and an aromatic monoamine.

Among them, aniline is preferably used.</p>
    <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">As the primary monoamine, one not having another substituent which reacts with the epoxy compound is preferably used. This makes it possible to obtain an organic-solvent-soluble polyimide not having a substituent, which reacts with the epoxy compound, at the end of the polyimide having high molecular mobility. The use of such an organic-solvent-soluble polyimide makes it possible to suppress the progress of the reaction between the organic-solvent-soluble polyimide and the epoxy compound at room temperature to enhance the storage life of the adhesive agent.</p>

By setting m to 8 or more, it is possible to increase the viscosity of the resulting adhesive agent varnish to enable a thick coating, and by setting m to 200 or less, it is possible to improve the solubility of the polyimide in a solvent. Here, a measurement method of the weight average molecular weight of the polyimide will be exemplified below. A polyimide solution having a solid concentration of 0.1% by mass is prepared by dissolving the polyimide in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), and the polystyrene equivalent weight average molecular weight is calculated using the polyimide solution and a GPC apparatus Waters 2690 (manufactured by Waters Corporation). GPC measurement is performed using NMP containing 0.05 mol/L of LiCl and 0.05 mol/L of phosphoric acid dissolved therein as a mobile phase at a developing speed of 0.4 mL/min.

Further, a polyimide having another structure may be additionally mixed in addition to these polyimides.

The type and amount of the structure used for copolymerization or mixing are preferably selected to an extent not impairing the heat resistance of a heat resistant resin obtained by heat treatment.</p>
    <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The polyimide (a) is synthesized by a publicly known method by substituting part of a diamine with a terminal blocking agent which is a monoamine or by substituting part of an acid dianhydride with a terminal blocking agent which is a monocarboxylic acid, an acid anhydride, a monoacid chloride compound, or a monoactive ester compound. For example, a polyimide precursor is obtained by a method in which a tetracarboxylic dianhydride is reacted with a diamine compound (part of which is substituted with a terminal blocking agent that is a monoamine) at a low temperature, a method in which a tetracarboxylic dianhydride (part of which is substituted with a terminal blocking agent that is an acid anhydride, a monoacid chloride compound, or a monoactive ester compound) is reacted with a diamine compound at a low temperature, a method in which a diester is obtained by the reaction between a tetracarboxylic dianhydride and an alcohol and is then reacted with a diamine (part of which is substituted with a terminal blocking agent that is a monoamine) in the presence of a condensing agent, or a method in which a diester is obtained by the reaction between a tetracarboxylic dianhydride and an alcohol and then the residual dicarboxylic acid is acid-chlorinated and reacted with a diamine (part of which is substituted with a terminal blocking agent that is a monoamine) . Subsequently, the polyimide precursor is subjected to imide ring closure by a publicly known method and thereby, a polyimide can be synthesized.</p>
    <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">A structure represented by the general formula (1) introduced into the polymer and a structure derived from a terminal blocking agent can be easily detected and quantitatively analyzed in the following manner. For example, a polymer into which a structure represented by the general formula (1) and a terminal blocking agent have been introduced is dissolved in an acidic solution or a basic solution to decompose it into a diamine component and an acid anhydride component which are constituent units of the polymer, and the resulting decomposed product was measured by using gas chromatography (GC) or NMR, and thereby, the structure represented by the general formula (1) and the terminal blocking agent used can be easily detected and quantitatively analyzed. Alternatively, also when a polyimide into which a terminal blocking agent has been introduced is directly subjected to pyrolysis gas chromatography (PGC) or infrared spectral measurement and <sup>13</sup>CNMR spectral measurement, the structure represented by the general formula (1) and the terminal blocking agent used can be easily detected and quantitatively analyzed.</p>

When the content of the polyimide (a) is 15 parts by mass or more, heat resistance is more improved. On the other hand, when the content of the polyimide (a) is 90 parts by mass or less, the adhesive agent becomes lower in water absorption, and therefore foaming in hardening the adhesive agent by heating can be more suppressed, and for example, a reduction of the adhesive force between a circuit board and a semiconductor chip is more reduced, and connection reliability is more improved.</p>
    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The adhesive agent of the present invention contains the epoxy compound (b). The epoxy compound (b) reacts with a phenolic hydroxyl group, a sulfonic acid group, or a thiol group in the acid-modified rosin (c) or the polyimide side chain to form a hardened article having a high-density network structure, and therefore the resulting hardened adhesive agent exhibits resistance to various chemicals. Thereby, the resistance of the adhesive agent to various solvents, especially to N-methylpyrrolidone can be increased. Further, since the epoxy compound is generally hardened by a ring-opening reaction accompanied by no shrinkage, it becomes possible to reduce the shrinkage of the adhesive agent during hardening. As the epoxy compound (b), an epoxy compound having two or more epoxy groups or an epoxy compound having an epoxy equivalent of 100 to 500 is preferably used. By setting the epoxy equivalent to 100 or more, the toughness of the hardened adhesive agent can be increased. By setting the epoxy equivalent to 500 or less, it is possible to allow the hardened adhesive agent to have a high-density network structure and excellent electrical insulation properties.</p>
    <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The epoxy compound (b) contains both of a liquid epoxy compound and a solid epoxy compound, and the liquid epoxy compound content is preferably 20% by mass or more and 70% by mass or less, and more preferably 30% by mass or more and 60% by mass or less with respect to the total amount of the epoxy compound. When the adhesive agent contains the liquid epoxy compound in an amount of a value within the above range, the adhesive agent can have appropriate plasticity and flexibility as an adhesive agent for semiconductors.</p>
    <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Herein, the liquid epoxy compound refers to one having a viscosity of 150 Paâ¢s or less at a temperature of 25Â°C and a pressure of 1.013 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup>, and the solid epoxy compound refers to one having a viscosity exceeding 150 Paâ¢s at a temperature of 25Â°C.

These solid epoxy compounds may be used in combination of two or more thereof.</p>
    <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046"> The adhesive agent of the present invention contains an acid-modified rosin (c). The acid-modified rosin is obtained by subjecting raw material rosins such as a gum rosin, a wood rosin and a tall oil rosin, and unsaturated carboxylic acids such as (meth)acrylic acid, (anhydrous) maleic acid, fumaric acid, (anhydrous) citraconic acid and (anhydrous) itaconic acid to a diels-alder reaction (addition reaction). The raw material rosin is preferably refined by distillation, recrystallization or extraction for use in order to remove impurities such as metals and improve a resin color. The acid-modified rosin can be modified to an acid-modified rosin having a transparent color by hydrogenation. Examples of such acid-modified rosins include PINECRYSTAL (registered trademark) KE-604, PINECRYSTAL (registered trademark) KR-120, and MALKYD (registered trademark) No. 33 (trade names, produced by ARAKAWA CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, LTD.).</p>
    <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">These acid-modified rosins have two or more carboxyl groups. Therefore, the acid-modified rosin has excellent compatibility with the organic-solvent-soluble polyimide (a) and the epoxy compound (b). The acid-modified rosin can react with the epoxy compound to form a high-density network structure. It is thought that since the acid-modified rosin has a bulky cyclohexane ring produced by a bulky structure of the rosin itself and acid-modification, this sterically hinders the epoxy group from reacting with the carboxyl group to enhance stability in heating conditions of a heat-drying process of the adhesive agent and an assembly process. On the other hand, for example, at temperatures of 200Â°C to 250Â°C which are a hardening temperature of the adhesive agent, molecular mobility of the acid-modified rosin is enhanced and a reaction with the epoxy compound quickly proceeds to enable the completion of hardening of the adhesive agent in a short time.</p>
    <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The content of the acid-modified rosin (c) in the adhesive agent is preferably 5 parts by mass or more and 30 parts by mass or less with respect to 100 parts by mass of the epoxy compound (b). By setting the content of the acid-modified rosin to a value within the above range, it is possible to be excellent in storage life and to harden the adhesive agent in a short time. The content of the acid-modified rosin (c) is more preferably 20 parts by mass or less with respect to 100 parts by mass of the epoxy compound (b). Further, the content is more preferably 10 parts by mass or more.</p>
    <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Further, when the acid-modified rosin is used, there is also an effect of improving adhesiveness of the adhesive agent to metal materials such as an electrode and imparting a flux function to the adhesive agent. That is, by electrically connecting the circuit members by use of the adhesive agent of the present invention, it is possible to keep a joint clean, prevent resins or inorganic particles which are components of the adhesive agent from immixing between the circuit members of the joint, and enhance solder wettability. As described above, the acid-modified rosin (c) has an effect on both of an improvement of adhesiveness and an improvement of reliability of an electric connection. In addition to this, as described above, since an acidic group of the acid-modified rosin is consumed by the reaction with the epoxy compound during a hardening reaction and since the acid-modified rosin has a bulky structure, it is possible to prevent a metal portion such as an electrode from being corroded after bonding.</p>
    <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In addition to this, another publicly known latent hardener other than the acid-modified rosin may be used in conjunction with the acid-modified rosin. Particularly, a basic latent hardener exerts an interactive force with the acid-modified rosin, and therefore it can further enhance a latent property. As the basic latent hardener, imidazole-based latent hardeners can be preferably used. Specific examples of the imidazole-based latent hardeners to be preferably used include CUREZOL (registered trademark) 2PZCNS, CUREZOL (registered trademark) 2PZCNS-PW, CUREZOL (registered trademark) C11Z-CNS, CUREZOL (registered trademark) 2MZ-A, CUREZOL (registered trademark) C11-A, CUREZOL (registered trademark) 2E4MZ-A, CUREZOL (registered trademark) 2MZA-PW, CUREZOL (registered trademark) 2MAOK-PW, and CUREZOL (registered trademark) 2PHZ-PW (trade names, produced by SHIKOKU CHEMICALS CORPORATION); and NOVACURE (registered trademark) HX-3941HP, NOVACURE (registered trademark) HXA3922HP, NOVACURE (registered trademark) HXA3932HP, and NOVACURE (registered trademark) HXA3042HP (trade names, manufactured by ASAHI KASEI E-MATERIALS CORPORATION) that are microcapsule-type hardeners obtained by treating imidazole-based latent hardeners with isocyanates.</p>
    <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The adhesive agent of the present invention may further contain the inorganic particles (d). Examples of the material of the inorganic particles (d) include silica, alumina, titania, silicon nitride, boron nitride, aluminum nitride, iron oxide, glass, other metal oxides, metal nitrides, metal carbonates, and metal sulfates such as barium sulfate. These materials may be used singly or in combination of two or more of them. Among them, silica and alumina are preferably used from the viewpoint of low thermal expansibility, thermal dissipation performance, low moisture absorptivity, and dispersion stability in the adhesive agent.</p>
    <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The content of the inorganic particles (d) in the adhesive agent is preferably 30 to 80% by mass and more preferably 50 to 70% by mass with respect to the total amount of the aforementioned components (a) to (d). When the content of the inorganic particles (d) is 30 to 80% by mass, irregular thickness due to flow deformation hardly occurs during heat-drying the adhesive agent, and in association with this, connection reliability of a semiconductor device prepared by using this adhesive agent is more improved. It is more possible to maintain sufficient connection reliability particularly when the semiconductor device is subjected to a process where higher durability is required such as a moisture absorption-reflow process and a thermal cycle process. Further, dispersibility of inorganic particles in the adhesive agent is more sufficient, and the agglomeration of the inorganic particles less occurs. Further, when the adhesive agent is applied onto a release plastic film to form an adhesive film and the adhesive film is wound into a roll shape, problems that cracks are produced in the adhesive sheet or the adhesive sheet is separated from the release plastic film hardly occur.</p>
    <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The inorganic particles (d) may have either a spherical form or a nonspherical form such as a crushed form or a flake form; however, they preferably have a spherical form from the viewpoint of easy uniform dispersibility in the adhesive agent. Further, the average particle size of the spherical inorganic particles is preferably 3 Âµm or less. The average particle size is more preferably 10 nm or more and 1 Âµm or less. When the average particle size is 10 nm or more, dispersibility of the inorganic particles is more improved, which allows the inorganic particles to be contained in the adhesive agent in a higher concentration. When the average particle size is 3 Âµm or less, since a surface area of the inorganic particles is adequately large, an interactive force of the inorganic particles (d) with the above components (a) to (c) and a component mixed as required is adequately large, and the adhesive agent is more hardly fluidized and deformed during heat-drying.</p>
    <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">When the adhesive agent needs to have transparency, the particle size of the inorganic particles is preferably 100 nm or less, more preferably 60 nm or less. For example, the adhesive agent needs to have transparency when, after a film of the adhesive agent is formed on a substrate, it is necessary to visually identify marks on the surface of the substrate through the adhesive agent for the purpose of alignment and the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">It is to be noted that the average particle size of the inorganic particles refers to the most frequently observed size of the individual inorganic particles. When the inorganic particles have a spherical form, the particle size of the inorganic particles refers to its diameter, and when the inorganic particles have an oval or flat form, the particle size refers to its maximum length in such a shape. Further, when the inorganic particles have a rod or fibrous form, the particle size refers to its maximum longitudinal length. As a method for measuring the average particle size of the inorganic particles contained in the adhesive agent, a SEM (scanning electron microscope) is used for directly observing the particles and measuring particle sizes of 100 particles. The maximum likelihood particle size on the number basis is selected from a distribution of the particle sizes obtained by measurement and defined as an average particle size.</p>
    <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">For the purpose of reducing the stress of a film obtained by hardening the adhesive agent, the adhesive agent of the present invention may further contain a thermoplastic resin.

The adhesive agent of the present invention may be used as an adhesive agent film obtained by forming the adhesive agent into a sheet-shape. Examples of the method of forming the adhesive agent into a sheet shape include a method of applying the adhesive agent varnish onto a release base material and then removing a solvent.</p>
    <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Examples of the solvent include, but not limited to: ketone-based solvents such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclopentanone, and cyclohexanone; ether-based solvents such as 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofurane, and diglyme; glycol ether-based solvents such as methyl cellosolve, ethyl cellosolve, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monoethyl ether, propylene glycol monobutyl ether, and diethylene glycol methyl ethyl ether; and other solvents such as benzyl alcohol, N-methylpyrrolidone, Î³-butyrolactone, ethyl acetate, and N,N-dimethylformamide. These solvents may be used singly or in combination of two or more thereof.</p>
    <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Examples of the release base material include, but not limited to, polypropylene film, polyethylene terephthalate film, polyethylene naphthalate film, polyester film, polyvinyl chloride film, polycarbonate film, polyimide film, fluoropolymer film such as polytetrafluoroethylene film, polyphenylene sulfide film, polypropylene film, and polyethylene film. The release base material may be subjected to release treatment using a releasing agent such as a silicone-based releasing agent, a long-chain alkyl-based releasing agent, a fluorine-based releasing agent, or an aliphatic amide-based releasing agent. The thickness of the release base material is not particularly limited; however, the thickness is usually preferably 5 to 75 Âµm. The thickness of the release base material is preferably equal to or larger than that of the adhesive agent from the viewpoint of reducing residual stress in the adhesive agent. Further, another release base material is preferably laminated on the surface of the adhesive agent opposite to the surface having the release base material of the adhesive agent film, that is, the adhesive agent film is preferably sandwiched between two release base materials. As the another release base material, one made of the above-mentioned material and having a thickness within the above-mentioned range may be used. The two release base materials may be the same.</p>
    <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">When the release base material is laminated on both sides of the adhesive agent film, it is preferred that there is a difference between the adhesive force between one of the release base materials and the adhesive agent film and the adhesive force between the other release base material and the adhesive agent film. Particularly, the difference in adhesive force is preferably 5 N/m or more, more preferably 47 N/m or less. By setting the difference in adhesive force to 5 N/m or more, it is possible, when one of the release base materials whose adhesive force to the adhesive agent film is smaller is peeled off, to prevent the adhesive agent film from being totally or partially separated from the other release base material. Further, by setting the difference in adhesive force to 47 N/m or less, the adhesive agent is less likely to remain on the surface of each of the release base materials when the release base material is peeled off.</p>

The minimum melt viscosity is more preferably 600 Paâ¢s or more and 5,000 Paâ¢s or less. By setting the minimum melt viscosity to a value within the above range, in the case of using the adhesive agent as an adhesive agent film, it is possible to laminate the adhesive agent film on a semiconductor wafer or a circuit board without causing the film to be wrinkled or trapping air bubbles between the film and the semiconductor wafer or the circuit board. In addition, it is also possible to reduce the amount of the adhesive agent squeezing out from the edges of a semiconductor chip during semiconductor chip bonding. It is to be noted that the minimum melt viscosity of the adhesive agent can be measured using, for example, a dynamic viscoelasticity measurement apparatus and a sample having a diameter of 15 mm and a thickness of 0.8 mm at a temperature rise rate of 2Â°C/min, a measuring frequency of 1 Hz and a measuring distortion of 9% within a measurement temperature range of 0 to 150Â°C. The viscosity of the adhesive agent decreases as the measurement temperature increases from 0Â°C, but it turns to an increase due to a hardening reaction when the temperature exceeds a certain value. A minimal value of the viscosity at this time is taken as a minimum melt viscosity.</p>
    <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">The adhesive agent of the present invention preferably has a minimum melt viscosity of 100 to 10000 Paâ¢s after stored for one month under the circumstance of 23Â°C and 55% in relative humidity (RH). Thereby, even when the adhesive agent film made of the adhesive agent of the present invention is laminated on a semiconductor wafer or a circuit board after storage for an extended period of time, it is possible to laminate the adhesive agent film without causing the film to be wrinkled or trapping air bubbles between the film and the semiconductor wafer or the circuit board.

After these treatment, each of the circuit boards with a semiconductor was incorporated into a liquid crystal substrate to prepare a liquid crystal panel, and all liquid crystal panels using the circuit boards with a semiconductor subjected to 1000 or 2000 cycles were subjected to a display test. The case where all the 10 liquid crystal panels using the circuit boards after 1000 cycles or 2000 cycles displayed images was rated as "A", and the case where not all the 10 liquid crystal panels displayed images due to the occurrence of defective connection was rated as "C". The evaluation results are shown in Tables 1 to 4 (After Reliability Test/1000 cycles, 2000 cycles).</p>

    <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">From the result of comparison between Examples 1 to 30 and Comparative Examples 1 to 8, it is found that the adhesive agent not containing acid-modified rosin has low storage life, and therefore connection reliability cannot be obtained at all when the adhesive agent films, the tape rolls of which were stored for 1 month or 3 months under the circumstance of 23Â°C and 55% in RH, were used. Further, it is found that when the adhesive agent contains inorganic particle, connection reliability is maintained even when the adhesive agent is subjected to a moisture absorption-reflow process and a thermal cycle process.</p>
