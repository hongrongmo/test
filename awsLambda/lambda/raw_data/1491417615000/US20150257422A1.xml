      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The invention relates to compounds suitable for modifying receptors and their ligands associated with chemosensory or chemosensory related sensation or reaction.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The taste system provides sensory information about the chemical composition of the external world. Taste transduction is one of the most sophisticated forms of chemical-triggered sensation in animals. Signaling of taste is found throughout the animal kingdom, from simple metazoans to the most complex of vertebrates. Mammals are believed to have five basic taste modalities: sweet, bitter, sour, salty, and umami (the taste of monosodium glutamate, a.k.a. savory taste).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are health concerns on the rise globally, but are growing at alarming rates in the United States. Sugar and calories are key components that can be limited to render a positive nutritional effect on health. High-intensity sweeteners can provide the sweetness of sugar, with various taste qualities. Because they are many times sweeter than sugar, much less of the sweetener is required to replace the sugar.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">High-intensity sweeteners have a wide range of chemically distinct structures and hence possess varying properties, such as, without limitation, odor, flavor, mouthfeel, and aftertaste. These properties, particularly flavor and aftertaste, are well known to vary over the time of tasting, such that each temporal profile is sweetener-specific (Tunaley, A., âPerceptual Characteristics of Sweetenersâ, Progress in Sweeteners, T. H. Grenby, Ed. Elsevier Applied Science, 1989).</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Sweeteners such as saccharin and 6-methyl-1,2,3-oxathiazin-4(3H)-one-2,2-dioxide potassium salt (acesulfame potassium) are commonly characterized as having bitter and/or metallic aftertastes. Products prepared with 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid are claimed to display reduced undesirable aftertastes associated with sweeteners, and do so at concentrations below those concentrations at which their own tastes are perceptible. Also, high intensity sweeteners such as sucralose and aspartame are reported to have sweetness delivery problems, i.e., delayed onset and lingering of sweetness (S. G. Wiet, et al., J. Food Sci., 58(3):599-602, 666 (1993)).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">It has been reported that an extra-cellular domain, e.g., the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor, especially one or more interacting sites within the Venus flytrap domain, is a suitable target for compounds or other entities to modulate the chemosensory receptor and/or its ligands. Certain compounds have been reported to be modulators of the chemosensory receptors in T1R family and/or their ligands and are described in the four patent applications listed below.</p>

      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0072">The present compounds can be used for one or more methods of the present invention, e.g., modifying receptors and their ligands associated with chemosensory or chemosensory related sensation or reaction. According to the present invention, a method of modulating a chemosensory receptor and/or its ligand includes modulating the activity, structure, function, expression, and/or modification of a chemosensory receptor as well as modulating, treating, or taking prophylactic measure of a condition, e.g., physiological or pathological condition, associated with a chemosensory receptor. In general, a physiological or pathological condition associated with a chemosensory receptor includes a condition, disease, or disorder associated with the chemosensory receptor and/or its ligand, e.g., gastrointestinal disorders, metabolic disorders, functional gastrointestinal disorders, etc. In one embodiment, the method includes increasing or enhancing sweet flavor. In another embodiment, the method includes modulating a sweet receptor and/or its ligand expressed in a place of the body other than the taste buds, such as an internal organ. In general, the compounds of the present invention, individually or in combination, can be provided in a composition, such as, e.g., an ingestible composition. In one embodiment, the present compound can impart a more sugar-like temporal profile and/or flavor profile to a sweetener composition by combining one or more present compound with one or more sweetener in the sweetener composition. In another embodiment, the present compound can increase or enhance the sweet taste of a composition by contacting the composition thereof with one or more present compound to form a modified composition. In another embodiment, the present compound can be in a composition that modulates the sweet receptors and/or their ligands expressed in the body other than in the taste buds.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0073">The compounds of Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), and its various subgenuses and species, and their salts and/or solvates, should preferably be comestibly acceptable, e.g., deemed suitable for consumption in food or drink from the perspective of giving unmodified comestible compositions an improved and/or pleasing sweet taste, and would not be significantly toxic or causes unpleasant or undesirable pharmacological or toxicological effects on an animal or human at the typical concentrations they are employed as flavoring agents for the comestible compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0074">One of the methods of demonstrating that a flavorant compound is comestibly acceptable is to have the compound tested and/or evaluated by an Expert Panel of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) and declared as to be âGenerally Recognized As Safeâ (âGRASâ). The FEMA/GRAS evaluation process for flavorant compounds is complex but well known to those of ordinary skill in the food product preparation arts, as is discussed by Smith, et al. in an article entitled âGRAS Flavoring Substances 21,â Food Technology, 57(5), pgs 46-59, May 2003, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In addition to the FEMA expert panel, an independent, qualified panel of experts in pertinent scientific disciplines may be formed by the manufacturer to evaluate the safety of a specific compound for GRAS status. This process is known as a âself determination of GRAS status.â Another method of demonstrating that a flavorant compound is comestibly acceptable is to obtain favorable review by the WHO/FAO Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, or JECFA. There are also other evaluation methods, such as independent review by the regulatory agency, which are generally known to those of ordinary skill in the food product preparation arts.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0075">In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention can be used at its ligand enhancing concentrations, e.g., very low concentrations on the order of a few parts per million, in combination with one or more known sweeteners, natural or artificial, so as to reduce the concentration of the known sweetener required to prepare an ingestible composition having the desired degree of sweetness.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0076">In one embodiment, the present compounds can enhance the sweetness of a sweetener under a broad range of pH, e.g., from lower pH to neutral pH. The lower and neutral pH includes, but is not limited to, a pH from about 2.5 to about 8.5; from about 2.5 to about 8.0; from about 2.8 to about 7.5; from about 3.0 to about 7, and from about 3.5 to about 7. In certain embodiments, the present compounds can enhance the perceived sweetness of a fixed concentration of a sweetener in taste tests at a compound concentration of about 50 Î¼M, 40 Î¼M, 30 Î¼M, 20 Î¼M, or 10 Î¼M at both low to neutral pH value. In certain embodiments, the enhancement factor of the present compounds at the lower pH is substantially similar to the enhancement factor of the compounds at neutral pH. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the present compounds demonstrate enhanced photostability. That is, when exposed to a light source, the present compounds have stability and less prone to degradation. Such photostability and consistent sweet enhancing property under a broad range of pH render the present compounds good candidates for a broad use in a wide variety of foods and beverages.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0077">Commonly used known or artificial sweeteners for use in such combinations of sweeteners include but are not limited to the common saccharide sweeteners, e.g., sucrose, fructose, glucose, and sweetener compositions comprising natural sugars, such as corn syrup (including high fructose corm syrup) or other syrups or sweetener concentrates derived from natural fruit and vegetable sources, semi-synthetic âsugar alcoholâ sweeteners such as erythritol, isomalt, lactitol, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, maltodextrin, and the like, and artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame-K, cyclamate, sucralose, and alitame. Sweeteners also include cyclamic acid, mogroside, tagatose, maltose, galactose, mannose, sucrose, fructose, lactose, neotame and other aspartame derivatives, glucose, D-tryptophan, glycine, maltitol, lactitol, isomalt, hydrogenated glucose syrup (HGS), hydrogenated starch hydrolyzate (HSH), stevioside, rebaudioside A and other sweet <i>Stevia</i>-based glycosides, carrelame and other guanidine-based sweeteners, etc. The term âsweetenersâ also includes combinations of sweeteners as disclosed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0078">In one embodiment, the present compound is added to a noncomestible composition or non-edible product, such as supplements, nutraceuticals, functional food products (e.g., any fresh or processed food claimed to have a health-promoting and/or disease-preventing properties beyond the basic nutritional function of supplying nutrients), pharmaceutical product, over the counter (OTC) product, oral care product, cosmetic products such as sweetened lip balms, and other personal care products.</p>

      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0101">One application of the present compounds is for modulating (inducing, enhancing or inhibiting) the sweet taste or other taste properties of other natural or synthetic sweet tastants, and ingestable compositions made therefrom. In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention is used or provided in its ligand enhancing concentration(s). For example, a broad but also low range of concentrations of the compounds or entities of the present invention would typically be required, i.e., from about 0.001 ppm to 100 ppm, or narrower alternative ranges from about 0.1 ppm to about 10 ppm, from about 0.01 ppm to about 30 ppm, from about 0.05 ppm to about 10 ppm, from about 0.01 ppm to about 5 ppm, or from about 0.02 ppm to about 2 ppm, or from about 0.01 ppm to about 1 ppm.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0102">In one embodiment, the present invention provides a sweet enhancing composition. The sweet enhancing composition comprises a compound of the present invention in an amount effective to provide sweetening, e.g., sweet flavor enhancing amount in combination with a first amount of sweetener, wherein the sweetening is more than the sweetening provided by the first amount of sweetener without the compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0103">In one embodiment, the present invention provides an ingestible composition which comprises the sweet enhancing composition of the present invention. In certain embodiments, the present ingestible composition is in the form of a food or beverage product, a pharmaceutical composition, a nutritional product, a dietary supplement, over-the-counter medication, or oral care product.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0104">In one embodiment, the present invention provides a sweetener replacement composition which comprises one or more compounds of the present invention in an amount effective to provide sweetening, e.g., at a concentration higher than their ligand enhancing concentration in the absence of a sweetener, e.g., sucrose other than the present compound(s).</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0105">According to another aspect of the invention, the compounds of the present invention are provided in a flavoring concentrate formulation, e.g., suitable for subsequent processing to produce a ready-to-use (i.e., ready-to-serve) product. By âa flavoring concentrate formulationâ, it is meant a formulation which should be reconstituted with one or more diluting medium to become a ready-to-use composition. The term âready-to-use compositionâ is used herein interchangeably with âingestible compositionâ, which denotes any substance that, either alone or together with another substance, can be taken by mouth whether intended for consumption or not. In one embodiment, the ready-to-use composition includes a composition that can be directly consumed by a human or animal. The flavoring concentrate formulation is typically used by mixing with or diluted by one or more diluting medium, e.g., any consumable or ingestible ingredient or product, to impart or modify one or more flavors to the diluting medium. Such a use process is often referred to as reconstitution. The reconstitution can be conducted in a household setting or an industrial setting. For example, a frozen fruit juice concentrate can be reconstituted with water or other aqueous medium by a consumer in a kitchen to obtain the ready-to-use fruit juice beverage. In another example, a soft drink syrup concentrate can be reconstituted with water or other aqueous medium by a manufacture in large industrial scales to produce the ready-to-use soft drinks Since the flavoring concentrate formulation has the flavoring agent or flavor modifying agent in a concentration higher than the ready-to-use composition, the flavoring concentrate formulation is typically not suitable for being consumed directly without reconstitution. There are many benefits of using and producing a flavoring concentrate formulation. For example, one benefit is the reduction in weight and volume for transportation as the flavoring concentrate formulation can be reconstituted at the time of usage by the addition of suitable solvent, solid or liquid.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0106">In one embodiment, the flavoring concentrate formulation comprises i) as flavor modifying ingredient, a compound of the present invention; ii) a carrier; and iii) optionally at least one adjuvant. The term âas flavor modifying ingredientâ denotes that the compound of the present invention acts as a flavoring agent or a flavor modifying agent (such as a flavor enhancer) in the formulation. The term âcarrierâ denotes a usually inactive accessory substance, such as solvents, binders, or other inert medium, which is used in combination with the present compound and one or more optional adjuvants to form the formulation. For example, water or starch can be a carrier for a flavoring concentrate formulation. In some embodiments, the carrier is the same as the diluting medium for reconstituting the flavoring concentrate formulation; and in other embodiments, the carrier is different from the diluting medium. The term âcarrierâ as used herein includes, but is not limited to, ingestibly acceptable carrier.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0107">The term âadjuvantâ denotes an additive which supplements, stabilizes, maintains, or enhances the intended function or effectiveness of the active ingredient, such as the compound of the present invention. In one embodiment, the at least one adjuvant comprises one or more flavoring agents. The flavoring agent may be of any flavor known to one skilled in the art or consumers, such as the flavor of chocolate, coffee, tea, mocha, French vanilla, peanut butter, chai, or combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the at least one adjuvant comprises one or more sweeteners. The one or more sweeteners can be any of the sweeteners described in this application. In another embodiment, the at least one adjuvant comprises one or more ingredients selected from the group consisting of a emulsifier, a stabilizer, an antimicrobial preservative, an antioxidant, vitamins, minerals, fats, starches, protein concentrates and isolates, salts, and combinations thereof. Examples of emulsifiers, stabilizers, antimicrobial preservatives, antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, fats, starches, protein concentrates and isolates, and salts are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,468,576, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0108">In one embodiment, the present flavoring concentrate formulation can be in a form selected from the group consisting of liquid including solution and suspension, solid, foamy material, paste, gel, cream, and a combination thereof, such as a liquid containing certain amount of solid contents. In one embodiment, the flavoring concentrate formulation is in form of a liquid including aqueous-based and nonaqueous-based. The present flavoring concentrate formulation can be carbonated or non-carbonated.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0109">The flavoring concentrate formulation may further comprise a freezing point depressant, nucleating agent, or both as the at least one adjuvant. The freezing point depressant is a ingestibly acceptable compound or agent which can depress the freezing point of a liquid or solvent to which the compound or agent is added. That is, a liquid or solution containing the freezing point depressant has a lower freezing point than the liquid or solvent without the freezing point depressant. In addition to depress the onset freezing point, the freezing point depressant may also lower the water activity of the flavoring concentrate formulation. The examples of the freezing point depressant include, but are not limited to, carbohydrates, oils, ethyl alcohol, polyol, e.g., glycerol, and combinations thereof. The nucleating agent denotes a ingestibly acceptable compound or agent which is able to facilitate nucleation. The presence of nucleating agent in the flavoring concentrate formulation can improve the mouthfeel of the frozen slushes of a frozen slush and to help maintain the physical properties and performance of the slush at freezing temperatures by increasing the number of desirable ice crystallization centers. Examples of nucleating agents include, but are not limited to, calcium silicate, calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the flavoring concentrate formulation is formulated to have a low water activity for extended shelf life. Water activity is the ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a formulation to the vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature. In one embodiment, the flavoring concentrate formulation has a water activity of less than about 0.85. In another embodiment, the flavoring concentrate formulation has a water activity of less than about 0.80. In another embodiment, the flavoring concentrate formulation has a water activity of less than about 0.75.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0110">In one embodiment, the flavoring concentrate formulation has the present compound in a concentration that is at least 2 times of the concentration of the compound in a ready-to-use composition. In one embodiment, the flavoring concentrate formulation has the present compound in a concentration that is at least 5 times of the concentration of the compound in a ready-to-use composition. In one embodiment, the flavoring concentrate formulation has the present compound in a concentration that is at least 10 times of the concentration of the compound in a ready-to-use composition. In one embodiment, the flavoring concentrate formulation has the present compound in a concentration that is at least 15 times of the concentration of the compound in a ready-to-use composition. In one embodiment, the flavoring concentrate formulation has the present compound in a concentration that is at least 20 times of the concentration of the compound in a ready-to-use composition. In one embodiment, the flavoring concentrate formulation has the present compound in a concentration that is at least 30 times of the concentration of the compound in a ready-to-use composition. In one embodiment, the flavoring concentrate formulation has the present compound in a concentration that is at least 40 times of the concentration of the compound in a ready-to-use composition. In one embodiment, the flavoring concentrate formulation has the present compound in a concentration that is at least 50 times of the concentration of the compound in a ready-to-use composition.

      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0111">The starting materials used in preparing the compounds of the invention, i.e. the various structural subclasses and species of the compounds of the synthetic precursors of the present compounds of Formula (I), are often known compounds, or can be synthesized by known methods described in the literature, or are commercially available from various sources well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as for example, Sigma-Aldrich Corporation of St. Louis, Mo. USA and their subsidiaries Fluka and Riedel-de Haen, at their various other worldwide offices, and other well known chemical suppliers such as Fisher Scientific, TCI America of Philadelphia, Pa., ChemDiv of San Diego, Calif., Chembridge of San Diego, Calif., Asinex of Moscow, Russia, SPECS/BIOSPECS of the Netherlands, Maybridge of Cornwall, England, Acros, TimTec of Russia, Comgenex of South San Francisco, Calif., and ASDI Biosciences of Newark, Del.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0112">It is recognized that the skilled artisan in the art of organic chemistry can readily carry out the synthesis of many starting materials and subsequent manipulations without further direction, that is, it is well within the scope and practice of the skilled artisan to carry out many desired manipulations. These include reduction of carbonyl compounds to their corresponding alcohols, oxidations, acylations, aromatic substitutions, both electrophilic and nucleophilic, etherifications, esterification, saponification, nitrations, hydrogenations, reductive animation and the like. These manipulations are discussed in standard texts such as March's Advanced Organic Chemistry (3d Edition, 1985, Wiley-Interscience, New York), Feiser and Feiser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis, and in the various volumes and editions oÃ¯Methoden der Organischen Chemie (Houben-Weyl), and the like. Many general methods for preparation of starting materials comprising variously substituted heterocyclic, hetereoaryl, and aryl rings (the precursors of Ar, hAr<sup>1</sup>, and/or hAr<sup>2</sup>) can be found in Methoden der Organischen Chemie (Houben-Weyl), whose various volumes and editions are available from Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart. The entire disclosures of the treatises recited above are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties for their teachings regarding methods for synthesizing organic compounds and their precursors.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0113">The skilled artisan will also readily appreciate that certain reactions are best carried out when other functionality is masked or protected in the molecule, thus avoiding any undesirable side reactions and/or increasing the yield of the reaction. Often the skilled artisan utilizes protecting groups to accomplish such increased yields or to avoid the undesired reactions. These reactions are found in the literature and are also well within the scope of the skilled artisan. Examples of many of these manipulations can be found for example in T. Greene and P. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3<sup>r </sup>Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons (1999).</p>

      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0150">Test samples containing experimental compounds are presented in pairs to the panelist and they are asked to determine which of the sample is sweeter. The present compounds showed sweet flavor enhancement in medium with a wide range of pH value, and this Experiment provided results for samples tested at pH of about 7.1 or about 2.8. A group of 10 to 16 or more panelists participated in each test. Subjects refrained from eating or drinking (except water) for at least 1 hour prior to the test. Subjects rinsed with water several times to clean the mouth.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0151">Taste tests were performed with sucrose or HFCS as the sweetener in the presence or absence of compound. A 0.2% stock solution of compound in water with sodium bicarbonate was prepared and then this stock solution was diluted in the final sample to achieve the targeted final concentration of compound. Taste samples were also prepared in a low sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.1; âLSBâ) lacking sucrose or HFCS to evaluate the taste of the compound alone. Low sodium phosphate buffer consists of 0.3 mM KCl, 0.5 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.175 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. Sample volumes are usually 20 ml.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0152">In one paired comparison test, the panelist is presented with two different samples and asked to identify the sample which is sweeter. The samples within a paired comparison test are presented in a randomized, counterbalanced order. Panelists have up to a 1 minute delay between taste tests to clear the mouth of any tastes.</p>
