      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Inventions of the present application are directed to the treatment of neuro-degenerative diseases such as Hutchinson Disease, Parkinson's disease, Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Neuro-degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Hutchinson's Disease, Parkinson's disease, Kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and other spongiform encephalopathies remain major health problems. Currently there are very limited means to treat these diseases. With respect to Alzheimer's, Hutchinson's and Parkinson's diseases, these diseases tend to manifest themselves in older individuals and as the diseases progress; the afflicted individuals are less able to care for themselves. It is therefore highly desirable to have simple therapies which can be administered (e.g. oral formulations) without the need for specially trained healthcare providers.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to drug delivery systems, dosage forms and methods for the treatment of neuro-degenerative diseases. Turning first to embodiments directed to an article of manufacture, one embodiment features an effective amount of a Bryostatin-1 in a biopolymer.

      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Embodiments of the present invention feature a biopolymer resistant to acid. For the purpose of the present discussion, resistance to acid refers to stomach acids at a pH of approximately 1 to 3 for a period of time of about 0.5 to 4.0 hours. One biopolymer is a poly (D, L-lactide-coglycoside). This biopolymer has two components, a lactide and a glycoside component. Embodiments of the present invention feature a poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycoside) having a ratio of lactide and glycoside of 25-75% lactide with the remaining comprising glycoside. A common ratio is 50:50 lactide to glycoside as determined by weight. This biopolymer is resistant to acid degradation and allows oral delivery of the drug to the small intestine for absorption.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Embodiments of the present invention feature microspheres that are lyophilized for reconstitution in an aqueous solution. Another embodiment features microspheres held in suspension for oral administration and/or held in an oral dosage form selected from the group of tablets, capsules, gel caps, and powders. Methods of making tablets, capsules, gel caps and powders are well known in the art. (Remington, âThe Science and Practice of Pharmacyâ-20<sup>th </sup>Edition Lippincott, Williams and Williams). Suspensions for oral administration are preferably flavored to improve patient acceptance.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Another embodiment of the present invention features pharmaceutically orally acceptable oil containing an effective amount of Bryostatin. An amount of oil for administration is determined, and an effective amount of Bryostatin is dissolved in such oil in a manner known in the art. Preferably, the amount of oil which is intended for oral administration is enclosed in a gel cap in a manner known in the art. For example, Vitamin D and Vitamin E supplements are often enclosed in gel cap formulations.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The present method and apparatus will be described with respect to <figref>FIG. 2</figref> which depicts in schematic form a polymer sphere apparatus, generally designated by the numeral <b>13</b>. The polymer sphere apparatus is comprised of the following major elements: a polymer vessel <b>15</b>, a Bryostatin drug injection assembly <b>17</b>, an admixture chamber <b>19</b>, a depressurization vessel <b>21</b>, and an orifice nozzle <b>23</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Polymer vessel <b>15</b> is in fluid communication with a supercritical critical or near critical syringe pump <b>25</b> via conduits <b>27</b><i>a, </i><b>27</b><i>b </i>and <b>27</b><i>c. </i>Supercritical, critical or near critical pump <b>25</b> is in fluid communication with a source of supercritical, critical or near critical fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Polymer vessel <b>15</b> is also in fluid communication with a modifier syringe pump <b>31</b> via conduit <b>33</b> which intersects with conduit <b>27</b><i>a </i>at junction <b>35</b>. Modifier syringe pump <b>31</b> is in communication with a source of modifiers and/or entrainers (not shown).</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Polymer vessel <b>15</b> is loaded with polymer. This polymer vessel receives supercritical, critical or near critical fluid from supercritical critical or near critical pump <b>25</b> via conduits <b>27</b><i>a, </i><b>27</b><i>b </i>and <b>27</b><i>c. </i>Polymer vessel <b>15</b> receives modifiers and/or entrainers from modifier pump <b>31</b> via conduit <b>33</b>. Polymer is dissolved in the supercritical, critical or near critical fluid and modifier to form a polymer solution. Formation of the polymer solution is facilitated by circulating the polymers and supercritical, critical or near critical fluid in a loop with a conduits <b>27</b><i>d, </i><b>27</b><i>d, </i><b>27</b><i>e, </i><b>27</b><i>f, </i>and <b>27</b><i>g, </i>a master valve <b>29</b>, a static mixer <b>31</b>, and a circulation pump <b>33</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Polymer vessel <b>15</b> is in fluid communication with admixture chamber <b>19</b> via conduits <b>37</b> and <b>39</b>. Admixture chamber <b>19</b> is also in fluid communication with Bryostatin drug injection assembly <b>17</b>. Bryostatin drug injection assembly <b>17</b> comprises Bryostatin drug syringe pump <b>43</b>, a source of a Bryostatin <b>41</b> and conduit <b>45</b>. Bryostatin drug syringe pump <b>43</b> is in communication with a source of Bryostatin material and pressurizes and compels such material through conduit <b>45</b>. Conduit <b>45</b> is in communication with admixture chamber via conduits <b>39</b> which intersects conduit <b>45</b> at junction <b>47</b>. Preferably, junction <b>47</b> is a mixing âTâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Admixture vessel <b>19</b> is in the nature of an inline mixer and thoroughly mixes incoming streams from the polymer vessel <b>15</b> and Bryostatin drug injection assembly <b>17</b>. Admixture vessel <b>19</b> is in communication with orifice nozzle <b>23</b> via conduit <b>49</b>. Orifice nozzle <b>23</b> is in the nature of a back pressure regulator and has a nozzle defining one or more orifices which discharge into depressurization vessel <b>21</b> via conduit <b>51</b>. Preferably orifice nozzle <b>23</b> controls pressure and decompression rates such that a supercritical critical or near critical carbon dioxide enters the orifice at a rate of about 0.425 mls/min and 0.075 mls/min acetone or about 0.5 mls/min carbon dioxide and ethanol combined to maintain system pressure at 2,500 psig.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The operating pressure of the system can be preset at a precise level via a computerized controller (not shown) that is part of the syringe pumps. Temperature control in the system is achieved by enclosing the apparatus <b>11</b> in Â¼â³ Lexan sheet while utilizing a Neslab heating/cooling system coupled with a heat exchanger (not shown) to maintain uniform temperature throughout the system.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In a typical experimental run, polymeric materials were first packed into the polymer vessel <b>15</b>. Supercritical critical or near critical fluid and an ethanolic solution of Bryostatin drug were charged into the supercritical, critical or near critical syringe pumps <b>25</b> and <b>31</b>, respectively, and brought to the desired operating pressure. In the alternative, an ethanol solution of Bryostatin drug is charged into bioactive syringe pump <b>43</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The system is pressurized with the supercritical critical or near critical fluid via supercritical, critical or near critical syringe pump <b>25</b> to the pressure level equal to that set in modifier syringe pump <b>31</b> and Bryostatin drug syringe pump <b>43</b>, and maintained at this level with the nozzle orifice <b>23</b>. The dynamic operating mode for all pumps is set so that each pump can be operated at its own desired flow rate. The supercritical critical or near critical stream flows through the polymer vessel <b>15</b>, dissolves polymer and contacts the Bryostatin drug stream at junction <b>47</b>. The mixture of supercritical critical nears critical fluid, Bryostatin drug and polymer materials is then passed through admixture chamber <b>19</b> for further mixing. Finally, the mixed solution entered orifice nozzle <b>23</b> and was injected into a 10% sucrose solution containing 0.1% polyvinyl alcohol, 40% ethanol with trace acetic acid in the depressurization vessel <b>21</b>. As a result of supercritical fluid decompression, polymer spheres containing Bryostatin drug are formed in the 10% sucrose solution, 0.1% polyvinyl alcohol, 40% ethanol with trace acetic acid. The expanded supercritical fluid exits the system via a vent line on the depressurization vessel <b>21</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The polymer spheres are in the nature of microspheres <b>11</b>. These microspheres <b>11</b> are frozen at â80Â° degrees Centigrade and lyophilized.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Oil based Bryostatin solutions are dissolved in olive oil with vitamin E as a preservative and lecithin and medium chain triglyceride emulsifiers to increase bioavailability. The oil with the dissolved Bryostatin is encapsulated in gel capsules with a nitrogen purge and head. In the alternative, the oil with dissolved Bryostatin is administered as a liquid dosage form. However, those skilled in the art recognize that oily formulations are not normally well received due to taste and texture. The oil with dissolved Bryostatin may also be emulsified and administered as a liquid formulation. Emulsification may mask some of the less desirable taste and texture associated with oil based oral formulations.</p>

      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0039">Results further suggest that nanospheres with Bryostatins and Bryostatin 1, in particular, induce alpha-secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to s-APP alpha, and activate protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms alpha, delta and epsilon (measured by membrane translocation) in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. These events are well-described cell and pharmacological events associated with prevention of beta-secretase mediated formation of beta-amyloid, the presumptive cause of dementia in human Alzheimer's disease and in the sweAPP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0041">Based on the hydrophobicity of Bryostatin-1, we developed an oil-based formulation of Bryostatin-1.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0042">A stock solution of 82 mg/100 mL of Bryostatin-1 was used. Isopropyl alcohol, Extra Virgin olive oil, sesame oil, and vegetable oil were all used as solvents.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0043">Thirty microliters of the stock solution were placed in each of 4 clean, dry HPLC vials. The ethanol was allowed to evaporate, leaving 25 micrograms in the vial. Then, 1.0 mL of the solvent was placed in the vial and vortexed to ensure proper mixing. These samples were then injected on a normal phase HPLC system, with a gradient of 10%-70% isopropyl alcohol in hexane as the mobile phase (specifically developed for this experiment).</p>

      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0045">The data in Table 2 indicates that Bryostatin-1 is soluble in a variety of different types of oil. The reason for the higher concentrations than the standard (isopropyl alcohol) is due to the baseline. While attempting a baseline subtraction for each oil, there was negative absorbance so the blank IPA sample was subtracted from each sample's baseline. While this incorporates a little more area for integration, the amount of Bryostatin in the oil was quantifiable. In addition, the sesame oil had an integration area that was much larger than the peak itself. When manipulating the review application within the Millennium HPLC software, it was seen that the peak itself had a similar area to that of the standard (Bryostatin in IPA).</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0046">Bryostatin-1 is soluble in a variety of oils, with the best results in Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil with excipients. Bryostatin-1 is formulated to a specific concentration in Extra Virgin olive containing mixed natural tocopherol antioxidants to improve stability, and lecithin and medium chain triglyceride emulsifiers to increase bioavailability. This formulation is then encapsulated in gel capsules with a N<sub>2 </sub>purge and head. Targeted concentrations are in the range of 10 to 25 82 g/mL.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0047">Water Maze Studies</p>

These tests suggest that mice that received Bryostatin-1 at a dose of 5 micrograms/mouse on alternative days orally in an oil formulation showed significant protection against Alzheimer's disease mediated memory loss produced by the APP/PS1 mutations as compared with memory acquisition skills seen in control animals.</p>
