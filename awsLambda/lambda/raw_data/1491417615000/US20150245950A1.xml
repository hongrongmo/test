      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims the benefit, under 35 USC 119(e), of the filing of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/947,399, titled âLOW PROFILE FLEXIBLE PRESSURE TRANSMISSION CONDUIT,â filed Mar. 3, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p>

    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This application relates generally to medical treatment systems and, more particularly, but not by way of limitation, to dressings, systems, and methods that may be suitable for treating a tissue site.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Depending on the medical circumstances, reduced pressure may be used for, among other things, reduced-pressure therapy to encourage granulation at a tissue site, draining fluids at a tissue site, closing a wound, reducing edema, promoting perfusion, and fluid management. Reduced pressure may be supplied remotely from a therapy device or reduced pressure source to, for example, a dressing that may be positioned at a tissue site. The reduced pressure may be transferred through a pressure transfer conduit, such as a tube, from the therapy device to the dressing. The pressure transfer conduit may also be used to conduct fluid away from the dressing.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The pressure transfer conduit may follow a route from the dressing to the therapy device that may closely follow the contours of the patient being treated. Thus, the pressure transfer conduit may, for example, be bent, kinked, or compressed during service, such as from the patient covering or lying on the pressure transfer conduit. Such bending, kinking, or other compression may cause restriction of a flow pathway in a conventional pressure transfer conduit, which may block or reduce pressure transfer through the pressure transfer conduit to below a therapeutic level. Additionally, a conventional pressure transfer conduit may cause patient discomfort when a patent is covering or lying on the pressure transfer conduit. For example, a conventional pressure transfer conduit may generate a point pressure on the patient, causing discomfort. Such discomfort can become severe and may generate or initiate a wound, such as a pressure sore. Conventional pressure transfer conduits may also be bulky, expensive, and require complex manufactured structures. Thus, improvements to systems, dressings, and methods that may enhance patient comfort and increase system reliability may be desirable.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In the following detailed description of non-limiting, illustrative embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, structural, mechanical, electrical, and chemical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the appended claims. To avoid detail not necessary to enable those skilled in the art to practice the embodiments described herein, the description may omit certain information known to those skilled in the art. Thus, the following detailed description is non-limiting, and the appended claims define the scope of the illustrative embodiments. As used herein, unless otherwise indicated, âorâ does not require mutual exclusivity.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Referring to the drawings, <figref>FIG. 1</figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a system <b>102</b> for treating a tissue site <b>104</b> of a patient. The tissue site <b>104</b> may extend through or otherwise involve an epidermis <b>106</b>, a dermis <b>108</b>, and a subcutaneous tissue <b>110</b>. The tissue site <b>104</b> may be a sub-surface tissue site as depicted in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> that may extend below the surface of the epidermis <b>106</b>. Further, the tissue site <b>104</b> may be a surface tissue site (not shown) that may predominantly reside on the surface of the epidermis <b>106</b>, such as, for example, an incision. The system <b>102</b> may provide therapy to, for example, the epidermis <b>106</b>, the dermis <b>108</b>, and the subcutaneous tissue <b>110</b>, regardless of the positioning of the system <b>102</b> or the type of tissue site. The system <b>102</b> may also be utilized without limitation at other tissue sites.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Further, the tissue site <b>104</b> may be the bodily tissue of any human, animal, or other organism, including bone tissue, adipose tissue, muscle tissue, dermal tissue, vascular tissue, connective tissue, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, or any other tissue. The treatment of the tissue site <b>104</b> may include the removal of fluids, such as exudate or ascites.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Continuing with <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the system <b>102</b> may include an optional tissue interface, such as an interface manifold <b>120</b>. Further, the system <b>102</b> may include a dressing <b>124</b> and a reduced-pressure source <b>128</b>. The reduced-pressure source <b>128</b> may be a component of an optional therapy unit <b>130</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. In some embodiments, the reduced-pressure source <b>128</b> and the therapy unit <b>130</b> may be separate components. As indicated above, the interface manifold <b>120</b> is an optional component that may be omitted for different types of tissue sites or different types of therapy using reduced pressure, such as, for example, epithelialization. If equipped, the interface manifold <b>120</b> may be adapted to be positioned proximate to or adjacent to the tissue site <b>104</b>, such as, for example, by cutting or otherwise shaping the interface manifold <b>120</b> in any suitable manner to fit the tissue site <b>104</b>. As described below, the interface manifold <b>120</b> may be adapted to be positioned in fluid communication with the tissue site <b>104</b> to distribute reduced pressure to the tissue site <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the interface manifold <b>120</b> may be positioned in direct contact with the tissue site <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The tissue interface or the interface manifold <b>120</b> may be formed from any manifold material or flexible bolster material that provides a vacuum space, or treatment space, such as, for example, a porous and permeable foam or foam-like material, a member formed with pathways, a graft, or a gauze. In some embodiments, the interface manifold <b>120</b> may be a reticulated, open-cell polyurethane or polyether foam that may be fluid permeable while under a reduced pressure. One such foam material is VACÂ® GranuFoamÂ® material available from Kinetic Concepts, Inc. (KCI) of San Antonio, Tex. Further, in some embodiments, any material or combination of materials may be used as a manifold material for the interface manifold <b>120</b> provided that the manifold material is operable to distribute or collect fluid. For example, herein the term manifold may refer to a substance or structure configured for delivering fluids to or removing fluids from a tissue site through a plurality of pores, pathways, or flow channels. The plurality of pores, pathways, or flow channels may be interconnected to improve the distribution of fluids provided to and removed from an area around the manifold. Examples of manifolds may include, without limitation, devices that have structural elements arranged to form flow channels, cellular foam, such as open-cell foam, porous tissue collections, and liquids, gels, and foams that include or cure to include flow channels.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In some embodiments, a material with a higher or lower density than GranuFoamÂ® material may be desirable for the interface manifold <b>120</b> depending on the application. Among the many possible materials, the following may be used without limitation: GranuFoamÂ® material; FoamexÂ® technical foam (www.foamex.com); a molded bed of nails structure; a patterned grid material, such as those manufactured by Sercol Industrial Fabrics; 3D textiles, such as those manufactured by Baltex of Derby, U.K.; a gauze; a flexible channel-containing member; or a graft. Further, in some embodiments, ionic silver may be added to the interface manifold <b>120</b> by, for example, a micro bonding process. Other substances, such as anti-microbial agents, may be added to the interface manifold <b>120</b> as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In some embodiments, the interface manifold <b>120</b> may comprise a porous, hydrophobic material. The hydrophobic characteristics of the interface manifold <b>120</b> may prevent the interface manifold <b>120</b> from directly absorbing fluid, such as exudate, from the tissue site <b>104</b>, but allow the fluid to pass through.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Continuing with <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the dressing <b>124</b> may be adapted to provide reduced pressure from the reduced-pressure source <b>128</b> to the interface manifold <b>120</b>, and to store fluid extracted from the tissue site <b>104</b> through the interface manifold <b>120</b>. The dressing <b>124</b> may include a base layer <b>132</b>, an adhesive <b>136</b>, a sealing member <b>140</b>, a fluid management assembly <b>144</b>, and a conduit interface <b>148</b>. Components of the dressing <b>124</b> may be added or removed to suit a particular application.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 1-4B</figref>, the base layer <b>132</b> may have a periphery <b>152</b> surrounding a central portion <b>156</b>, and a plurality of apertures <b>160</b> disposed through the periphery <b>152</b> and the central portion <b>156</b>. The base layer <b>132</b> may also have corners <b>158</b> and edges <b>159</b>. The corners <b>158</b> and the edges <b>159</b> may be part of the periphery <b>152</b>. One of the edges <b>159</b> may meet another of the edges <b>159</b> to define one of the corners <b>158</b>. Further, the base layer <b>132</b> may have a border <b>161</b> substantially surrounding the central portion <b>156</b> and positioned between the central portion <b>156</b> and the periphery <b>152</b>. The border <b>161</b> may be free of the apertures <b>160</b>. The base layer <b>132</b> may be adapted to cover the interface manifold <b>120</b> and tissue surrounding the tissue site <b>104</b> such that the central portion <b>156</b> of the base layer <b>132</b> is positioned adjacent to or proximate to the interface manifold <b>120</b>, and the periphery <b>152</b> of the base layer <b>132</b> is positioned adjacent to or proximate to tissue surrounding the tissue site <b>104</b>. In this manner, the periphery <b>152</b> of the base layer <b>132</b> may surround the interface manifold <b>120</b>. Further, the apertures <b>160</b> in the base layer <b>132</b> may be in fluid communication with the interface manifold <b>120</b> and tissue surrounding the tissue site <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The apertures <b>160</b> in the base layer <b>132</b> may have any shape, such as, for example, circles, squares, stars, ovals, polygons, slits, complex curves, rectilinear shapes, triangles, or other shapes. The apertures <b>160</b> may be formed by cutting, by application of local RF energy, or other suitable techniques for forming an opening. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>, each of the apertures <b>160</b> of the plurality of apertures <b>160</b> may be substantially circular in shape, having a diameter and an area. The area of each of the apertures <b>160</b> may refer to an open space or open area defining each of the apertures <b>160</b>. The diameter of each of the apertures <b>160</b> may define the area of each of the apertures <b>160</b>. For example, the area of one of the apertures <b>160</b> may be defined by multiplying the square of half the diameter of the aperture <b>160</b> by the value 3.14. Thus, the following equation may define the area of one of the apertures <b>160</b>: Area=3.14*(diameter/2)Ì2. The area of the apertures <b>160</b> described in the illustrative embodiments herein may be substantially similar to the area in other embodiments (not shown) for the apertures <b>160</b> that may have non-circular shapes. The diameter of each of the apertures <b>160</b> may be substantially the same, or each of the diameters may vary depending, for example, on the position of the aperture <b>160</b> in the base layer <b>132</b>. For example, the diameter of the apertures <b>160</b> in the periphery <b>152</b> of the base layer <b>132</b> may be larger than the diameter of the apertures <b>160</b> in the central portion <b>156</b> of the base layer <b>132</b>. Further, the diameter of each of the apertures <b>160</b> may be between about 1 millimeter to about 50 millimeters. In some embodiments, the diameter of each of the apertures <b>160</b> may be between about 1 millimeter to about 20 millimeters. The apertures <b>160</b> may have a uniform pattern or may be randomly distributed on the base layer <b>132</b>. The size and configuration of the apertures <b>160</b> may be designed to control the adherence of the dressing <b>124</b> to the epidermis <b>106</b> as described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>, in some embodiments, the apertures <b>160</b> positioned in the periphery <b>152</b> may be apertures <b>160</b><i>a</i>, the apertures <b>160</b> positioned at the corners <b>158</b> of the periphery <b>152</b> may be apertures <b>160</b><i>b</i>, and the apertures <b>160</b> positioned in the central portion <b>156</b> may be apertures <b>160</b><i>c</i>. The apertures <b>160</b><i>a </i>may have a diameter between about 9.8 millimeters to about 10.2 millimeters. The apertures <b>160</b><i>b </i>may have a diameter between about 7.75 millimeters to about 8.75 millimeters. The apertures <b>160</b><i>c </i>may have a diameter between about 1.8 millimeters to about 2.2 millimeters. The diameter of each of the apertures <b>160</b><i>a </i>may be separated from one another by a distance A between about 2.8 millimeters to about 3.2 millimeters. Further, the diameter of at least one of the apertures <b>160</b><i>a </i>may be separated from the diameter of at least one of the apertures <b>160</b><i>b </i>by the distance A. The diameter of each of the apertures <b>160</b><i>b </i>may also be separated from one another by the distance A. A center of one of the apertures <b>160</b><i>c </i>may be separated from a center of another of the apertures <b>160</b><i>c </i>in a first direction by a distance B between about 2.8 millimeters to about 3.2 millimeters. In a second direction transverse to the first direction, the center of one of the apertures <b>160</b><i>c </i>may be separated from the center of another of the apertures <b>160</b><i>c </i>by a distance C between about 2.8 millimeters to about 3.2 millimeters. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>, the distance B and the distance C may be increased for the apertures <b>160</b><i>c </i>in the central portion <b>156</b> being positioned proximate to or at the border <b>161</b> compared to the apertures <b>160</b><i>c </i>positioned away from the border <b>161</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>, the central portion <b>156</b> of the base layer <b>132</b> may be substantially square with each side of the central portion <b>156</b> having a length D between about 100 millimeters to about 108 millimeters. In some embodiments, the length D may be between about 106 millimeters to about 108 millimeters. The border <b>161</b> of the base layer <b>132</b> may have a width E between about 4 millimeters to about 11 millimeters and may substantially surround the central portion <b>156</b> and the apertures <b>160</b><i>c </i>in the central portion <b>156</b>. In some embodiments, the width E may be between about 9 millimeters to about 10 millimeters. The periphery <b>152</b> of the base layer <b>132</b> may have a width F between about 25 millimeters to about 35 millimeters and may substantially surround the border <b>161</b> and the central portion <b>156</b>. In some embodiments, the width F may be between about 26 millimeters to about 28 millimeters. Further, the periphery <b>152</b> may have a substantially square exterior with each side of the exterior having a length G between about 154 millimeters to about 200 millimeters. In some embodiments, the length G may be between about 176 millimeters to about 184 millimeters. Although <figref>FIGS. 4A-4B</figref> depict the central portion <b>156</b>, the border <b>161</b>, and the periphery <b>152</b> of the base layer <b>132</b> as having a substantially square shape, these and other components of the base layer <b>132</b> may have any shape to suit a particular application. Further, the dimensions of the base layer <b>132</b> as described herein may be increased or decreased, for example, substantially in proportion to one another to suit a particular application. The use of the dimensions in the proportions described above may enhance the cosmetic appearance of a tissue site. For example, these proportions may provide a surface area for the base layer <b>132</b>, regardless of shape, that is sufficiently smooth to enhance the movement and proliferation of epithelial cells at the tissue site <b>104</b>, and reduce the likelihood of granulation tissue in-growth into the dressing <b>124</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The base layer <b>132</b> may be a soft, pliable material suitable for providing a fluid seal with the tissue site <b>104</b> as described herein. For example, the base layer <b>132</b> may comprise a silicone gel, a soft silicone, hydrocolloid, hydrogel, polyurethane gel, polyolefin gel, hydrogenated styrenic copolymer gel, a foamed gel, a soft closed cell foam such as polyurethanes and polyolefins coated with an adhesive as described below, polyurethane, polyolefin, or hydrogenated styrenic copolymers. The base layer <b>132</b> may have a thickness between about 500 microns (Î¼m) and about 1000 microns (Î¼m). In some embodiments, the base layer <b>132</b> may have a stiffness between about 5 Shore 00 and about 80 Shore 00. Further, in some embodiments, the base layer <b>132</b> may be comprised of hydrophobic or hydrophilic materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In some embodiments (not shown), the base layer <b>132</b> may be a hydrophobic-coated material. For example, the base layer <b>132</b> may be formed by coating a spaced material, such as, for example, woven, nonwoven, molded, or extruded mesh with a hydrophobic material. The hydrophobic material for the coating may be a soft silicone, for example. In this manner, the adhesive <b>136</b> may extend through openings in the spaced material analogous to the apertures <b>160</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The adhesive <b>136</b> may be in fluid communication with the apertures <b>160</b> in at least the periphery <b>152</b> of the base layer <b>132</b>. In this manner, the adhesive <b>136</b> may be in fluid communication with tissue surrounding the tissue site <b>104</b> through the apertures <b>160</b> in the base layer <b>132</b>. As described further below and shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the adhesive <b>136</b> may extend or be pressed through the plurality of apertures <b>160</b> to contact the epidermis <b>106</b> for securing the dressing <b>124</b> to, for example, the tissue surrounding the tissue site <b>104</b>. The apertures <b>160</b> may provide sufficient contact of the adhesive <b>136</b> to the epidermis <b>106</b> to secure the dressing <b>124</b> about the tissue site <b>104</b>. However, the configuration of the apertures <b>160</b> and the adhesive <b>136</b>, described below, may permit release and repositioning of the dressing <b>124</b> about the tissue site <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">At least one of the apertures <b>160</b><i>a </i>in the periphery <b>152</b> of the base layer <b>132</b> may be positioned at the edges <b>159</b> of the periphery <b>152</b>, and may have an interior cut open or exposed at the edges <b>159</b> that is in fluid communication in a lateral direction with the edges <b>159</b>. The lateral direction may refer to a direction toward the edges <b>159</b> and in the same plane as the base layer <b>132</b>. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>, a plurality of the apertures <b>160</b><i>a </i>in the periphery <b>152</b> may be positioned proximate to or at the edges <b>159</b> and in fluid communication in a lateral direction with the edges <b>159</b>. The apertures <b>160</b><i>a </i>positioned proximate to or at the edges <b>159</b> may be spaced substantially equidistant around the periphery <b>152</b> as shown in <figref>FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>. However, in some embodiments, the spacing of the apertures <b>160</b><i>a </i>proximate to or at the edges <b>159</b> may be irregular. The adhesive <b>136</b> may be in fluid communication with the edges <b>159</b> through the apertures <b>160</b><i>a </i>being exposed at the edges <b>159</b>. In this manner, the apertures <b>160</b><i>a </i>at the edges <b>159</b> may permit the adhesive <b>136</b> to flow around the edges <b>159</b> for enhancing the adhesion of the edges <b>159</b> around the tissue site <b>104</b>, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Continuing with <figref>FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>, the apertures <b>160</b><i>b </i>at the corners <b>158</b> of the periphery <b>152</b> may be smaller than the apertures <b>160</b><i>a </i>in other portions of the periphery <b>152</b>. For a given geometry of the corners <b>158</b>, the smaller size of the apertures <b>160</b><i>b </i>compared to the apertures <b>160</b><i>a </i>may maximize the surface area of the adhesive <b>136</b> exposed and in fluid communication through the apertures <b>160</b><i>b </i>at the corners <b>158</b>. For example, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>, the edges <b>159</b> may intersect at substantially a right angle, or about 90 degrees, to define the corners <b>158</b>. Also as shown, the corners <b>158</b> may have a radius of about 10 millimeters. Three of the apertures <b>160</b><i>b </i>having a diameter between about 7.75 millimeters to about 8.75 millimeters may be positioned in a triangular configuration at the corners <b>158</b> to maximize the exposed surface area for the adhesive <b>136</b>. The size and number of the apertures <b>160</b><i>b </i>in the corners <b>158</b> may be adjusted as necessary, depending on the chosen geometry of the corners <b>158</b>, to maximize the exposed surface area of the adhesive <b>136</b> as described above. Further, the apertures <b>160</b><i>b </i>at the corners <b>158</b> may be fully housed within the base layer <b>132</b>, substantially precluding fluid communication in a lateral direction exterior to the corners <b>158</b>. The apertures <b>160</b><i>b </i>at the corners <b>158</b> being fully housed within the base layer <b>132</b> may substantially preclude fluid communication of the adhesive <b>136</b> exterior to the corners <b>159</b>, and may provide improved handling of the dressing <b>124</b> during deployment at the tissue site <b>104</b>. Further, the exterior of the corners <b>158</b> being substantially free of the adhesive <b>136</b> may increase the flexibility of the corners <b>158</b> to enhance comfort.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Similar to the apertures <b>160</b><i>b </i>in the corners <b>158</b>, any of the apertures <b>160</b> may be adjusted in size and number to maximize the surface area of the adhesive <b>136</b> in fluid communication through the apertures <b>160</b> for a particular application or geometry of the base layer <b>132</b>. For example, in some embodiments (not shown) the apertures <b>160</b><i>b</i>, or apertures of another size, may be positioned in the periphery <b>152</b> and at the border <b>161</b>. Similarly, the apertures <b>160</b><i>b</i>, or apertures of another size, may be positioned as described above in other locations of the base layer <b>132</b> that may have a complex geometry or shape.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The adhesive <b>136</b> may be a medically-acceptable adhesive. The adhesive <b>136</b> may also be flowable. For example, the adhesive <b>136</b> may comprise an acrylic adhesive, rubber adhesive, high-tack silicone adhesive, polyurethane, or other adhesive substance. In some embodiments, the adhesive <b>136</b> may be a pressure-sensitive adhesive comprising an acrylic adhesive with coating weight of 15 grams/m<sup>2 </sup>(gsm) to 70 grams/m<sup>2 </sup>(gsm). The adhesive <b>136</b> may be a layer having substantially the same shape as the periphery <b>152</b> of the base layer <b>132</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>. In some embodiments, the layer of the adhesive <b>136</b> may be continuous or discontinuous. Discontinuities in the adhesive <b>136</b> may be provided by apertures (not shown) in the adhesive <b>136</b>. Apertures in the adhesive <b>136</b> may be formed after application of the adhesive <b>136</b> or by coating the adhesive <b>136</b> in patterns on a carrier layer, such as, for example, a side of the sealing member <b>140</b> adapted to face the epidermis <b>106</b>. Further, apertures in the adhesive <b>136</b> may be sized to control the amount of the adhesive <b>136</b> extending through the apertures <b>160</b> in the base layer <b>132</b> to reach the epidermis <b>106</b>. Apertures in the adhesive <b>136</b> may also be sized to enhance the Moisture Vapor Transfer Rate (MVTR) of the dressing <b>124</b>, described further below.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Factors that may be utilized to control the adhesion strength of the dressing <b>124</b> may include the diameter and number of the apertures <b>160</b> in the base layer <b>132</b>, the thickness of the base layer <b>132</b>, the thickness and amount of the adhesive <b>136</b>, and the tackiness of the adhesive <b>136</b>. An increase in the amount of the adhesive <b>136</b> extending through the apertures <b>160</b> may correspond to an increase in the adhesion strength of the dressing <b>124</b>. A decrease in the thickness of the base layer <b>132</b> may correspond to an increase in the amount of adhesive <b>136</b> extending through the apertures <b>160</b>. Thus, the diameter and configuration of the apertures <b>160</b>, the thickness of the base layer <b>132</b>, and the amount and tackiness of the adhesive utilized may be varied to provide a desired adhesion strength for the dressing <b>124</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the thickness of the base layer <b>132</b> may be about 200 microns, the adhesive layer <b>136</b> may have a thickness of about 30 microns and a tackiness of 2000 grams per 25 centimeter wide strip, and the diameter of the apertures <b>160</b><i>a </i>in the base layer <b>132</b> may be about 10 millimeters.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In some embodiments, the tackiness of the adhesive <b>136</b> may vary in different locations of the base layer <b>132</b>. For example, in locations of the base layer <b>132</b> where the apertures <b>160</b> are comparatively large, such as the apertures <b>160</b><i>a</i>, the adhesive <b>136</b> may have a lower tackiness than other locations of the base layer <b>132</b> where the apertures <b>160</b> are smaller, such as the apertures <b>160</b><i>b </i>and <b>160</b><i>c</i>. In this manner, locations of the base layer <b>132</b> having larger apertures <b>160</b> and lower tackiness adhesive <b>136</b> may have an adhesion strength comparable to locations having smaller apertures <b>160</b> and higher tackiness adhesive <b>136</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Clinical studies have shown that the configuration described herein for the base layer <b>132</b> and the adhesive <b>136</b> may reduce the occurrence of blistering, erythema, and leakage when in use. Such a configuration may provide, for example, increased patient comfort and increased durability of the dressing <b>124</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Referring to the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, a release liner <b>162</b> may be attached to or positioned adjacent to the base layer <b>132</b> to protect the adhesive <b>136</b> prior to application of the dressing <b>124</b> to the tissue site <b>104</b>. Prior to application of the dressing <b>124</b> to the tissue site <b>104</b>, the base layer <b>132</b> may be positioned between the sealing member <b>140</b> and the release liner <b>162</b>. Removal of the release liner <b>162</b> may expose the base layer <b>132</b> and the adhesive <b>136</b> for application of the dressing <b>124</b> to the tissue site <b>104</b>. The release liner <b>162</b> may also provide stiffness to assist with, for example, deployment of the dressing <b>124</b>. The release liner <b>162</b> may be, for example, a casting paper, a film, or polyethylene. Further, the release liner <b>162</b> may be a polyester material such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or similar polar semi-crystalline polymer. The use of a polar semi-crystalline polymer for the release liner <b>162</b> may substantially preclude wrinkling or other deformation of the dressing <b>124</b>. For example, the polar semi-crystalline polymer may be highly orientated and resistant to softening, swelling, or other deformation that may occur when brought into contact with components of the dressing <b>124</b>, or when subjected to temperature or environmental variations, or sterilization. Further, a release agent may be disposed on a side of the release liner <b>162</b> that is configured to contact the base layer <b>132</b>. For example, the release agent may be a silicone coating and may have a release factor suitable to facilitate removal of the release liner <b>162</b> by hand and without damaging or deforming the dressing <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, the release agent may be fluorosilicone. In other embodiments, the release liner <b>162</b> may be uncoated or otherwise used without a release agent.</p>

The wicking of fluid along the first wicking layer <b>176</b> and the second wicking layer <b>180</b> may enhance the distribution of the fluid over a surface area of the absorbent layer <b>184</b>, which may increase absorbent efficiency and resist fluid blockages. Fluid blockages may be caused by, for example, fluid pooling in a particular location in the absorbent layer <b>184</b> rather than being distributed more uniformly across the absorbent layer <b>184</b>. The laminate combination of the first wicking layer <b>176</b>, the second wicking layer <b>180</b>, and the absorbent layer <b>184</b> may be adapted as described above to maintain an open structure, resistant to blockage, capable of maintaining fluid communication with, for example, the tissue site <b>104</b>.</p>

Specifically, the conduit interface <b>148</b> may be positioned in fluid communication with the enclosure <b>172</b> of the dressing <b>124</b>. The conduit interface <b>148</b> may also be adapted to be positioned in fluid communication with the optional interface manifold <b>120</b>. As shown, an optional liquid trap <b>192</b> may be positioned in fluid communication between the dressing <b>124</b> and the reduced-pressure source <b>128</b>. The liquid trap <b>192</b> may be any suitable containment device having a sealed internal volume capable of retaining liquid, such as condensate or other liquids.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The conduit interface <b>148</b> may comprise a medical-grade, soft polymer or other pliable material. As non-limiting examples, the conduit interface <b>148</b> may be formed from polyurethane, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), fluorosilicone, or ethylene-propylene. In some illustrative, non-limiting embodiments, conduit interface <b>148</b> may be molded from DEHP-free PVC. The conduit interface <b>148</b> may be formed in any suitable manner such as by molding, casting, machining, or extruding. Further, the conduit interface <b>148</b> may be formed as an integral unit or as individual components and may be coupled to the dressing <b>124</b> by, for example, adhesive or welding.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">In some embodiments, the conduit interface <b>148</b> may be formed of an absorbent material having absorbent and evaporative properties. The absorbent material may be vapor permeable and liquid impermeable, thereby being configured to permit vapor to be absorbed into and evaporated from the material through permeation while inhibiting permeation of liquids. The absorbent material may be, for example, a hydrophilic polymer such as a hydrophilic polyurethane. Although the term hydrophilic polymer may be used in the illustrative embodiments that follow, any absorbent material having the properties described herein may be suitable for use in the system <b>102</b>. Further, the absorbent material or hydrophilic polymer may be suitable for use in various components of the system <b>102</b> as described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The use of such a hydrophilic polymer for the conduit interface <b>148</b> may permit liquids in the conduit interface <b>148</b> to evaporate, or otherwise dissipate, during operation. For example, the hydrophilic polymer may allow the liquid to permeate or pass through the conduit interface <b>148</b> as vapor, in a gaseous phase, and evaporate into the atmosphere external to the conduit interface <b>148</b>. Such liquids may be, for example, condensate or other liquids. Condensate may form, for example, as a result of a decrease in temperature within the conduit interface <b>148</b>, or other components of the system <b>102</b>, relative to the temperature at the tissue site <b>104</b>. Removal or dissipation of liquids from the conduit interface <b>148</b> may increase visual appeal and prevent odor. Further, such removal of liquids may also increase efficiency and reliability by reducing blockages and other interference with the components of the system <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Similar to the conduit interface <b>148</b>, the liquid trap <b>192</b>, and other components of the system <b>102</b>, may also be formed of an absorbent material or a hydrophilic polymer. The absorptive and evaporative properties of the hydrophilic polymer may also facilitate removal and dissipation of liquids residing in the liquid trap <b>192</b>, and other components of the system <b>102</b>, by evaporation. Such evaporation may leave behind a substantially solid or gel-like waste. The substantially solid or gel-like waste may be cheaper to dispose than liquids, providing a cost savings for operation of the system <b>102</b>. The hydrophilic polymer may be used for other components in the system <b>102</b> where the management of liquids is beneficial.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">In some embodiments, the absorbent material or hydrophilic polymer may have an absorbent capacity in a saturated state that is substantially equivalent to the mass of the hydrophilic polymer in an unsaturated state. The hydrophilic polymer may be fully saturated with vapor in the saturated state and substantially free of vapor in the unsaturated state. In both the saturated state and the unsaturated state, the hydrophilic polymer may retain substantially the same physical, mechanical, and structural properties. For example, the hydrophilic polymer may have a hardness in the unsaturated state that is substantially the same as a hardness of the hydrophilic polymer in the saturated state. The hydrophilic polymer and the components of the system <b>102</b> incorporating the hydrophilic polymer may also have a size that is substantially the same in both the unsaturated state and the saturated state. Further, the hydrophilic polymer may remain dry, cool to the touch, and pneumatically sealed in the saturated state and the unsaturated state. The hydrophilic polymer may also remain substantially the same color in the saturated state and the unsaturated state. In this manner, this hydrophilic polymer may retain sufficient strength and other physical properties to remain suitable for use in the system <b>102</b>. An example of such a hydrophilic polymer is offered under the trade name Techophilic HP-93A-100, available from The Lubrizol Corporation of Wickliffe, Ohio, United States. Techophilic HP-93A-100 is an absorbent hydrophilic thermoplastic polyurethane capable of absorbing 100% of the unsaturated mass of the polyurethane in water and having a durometer or Shore Hardness of about 83 Shore A.</p>

The absorbent layer <b>284</b> may be positioned adjacent to or proximate to the second wicking layer <b>280</b> such that the peripheral portion <b>285</b> of the absorbent layer <b>284</b> is in contact with the sealing member <b>140</b> surrounding the peripheral portion <b>287</b> of the second wicking layer <b>280</b>. Similarly, the first wicking layer <b>276</b> may have a peripheral portion <b>286</b> extending beyond the peripheral portion <b>285</b> of the absorbent layer <b>284</b>. The first wicking layer <b>276</b> may be positioned adjacent to or proximate to the absorbent layer <b>284</b> such that the peripheral portion <b>286</b> of the first wicking layer <b>276</b> is in contact with the sealing member <b>140</b> surrounding the peripheral portion <b>285</b> of the absorbent layer <b>284</b>. Further, the first wicking layer <b>276</b> may be positioned adjacent to or proximate to the base layer <b>132</b>. Thus, at least the peripheral portion <b>287</b>, the peripheral portion <b>285</b>, and the peripheral portion <b>286</b> may be coupled to the sealing member <b>140</b>, such as, for example, by an adhesive coating disposed on a surface of the sealing member <b>140</b> facing the base layer <b>132</b>. The adhesive coating may be analogous to the adhesive <b>136</b> being applied across the surface of the sealing member <b>140</b> facing the base layer <b>132</b>. The second wicking layer <b>280</b>, the absorbent layer <b>284</b>, and the first wicking layer <b>276</b> may respectively have increasing surface areas to enhance contact with the adhesive coating described above. In other embodiments, the fluid management assembly <b>244</b> may include any number of absorbent layers and wicking layers for treating a particular tissue site.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">In operation of the system <b>102</b> according to some illustrative embodiments, the interface manifold <b>120</b> may be disposed against or proximate to the tissue site <b>104</b>. The dressing <b>124</b> may be applied over the interface manifold <b>120</b> and the tissue site <b>104</b> to form the sealed space <b>174</b>. Specifically, the base layer <b>132</b> may be applied covering the interface manifold <b>120</b> and tissue surrounding the tissue site <b>104</b>. The materials described above for the base layer <b>132</b> may have a tackiness that may hold the dressing <b>124</b> initially in position. The tackiness may be such that if an adjustment is desired, the dressing <b>124</b> may be removed and reapplied. Once the dressing <b>124</b> is in the desired position, a force may be applied, such as hand pressure, on a side of the sealing member <b>140</b> opposite the tissue site <b>104</b>. The force applied to the sealing member <b>140</b> may cause at least some portion of the adhesive <b>136</b> to penetrate or extend through the plurality of apertures <b>160</b> and into contact with tissue surrounding the tissue site <b>104</b>, such as the epidermis <b>106</b>, to releaseably adhere the dressing <b>124</b> about the tissue site <b>104</b>. In this manner, the configuration of the dressing <b>124</b> described above may provide an effective and reliable seal against challenging anatomical surfaces, such as an elbow or heal, at and around the tissue site <b>104</b>. Further, the dressing <b>124</b> may permit re-application or re-positioning to, for example, correct air leaks caused by creases and other discontinuities in the dressing <b>124</b> and the tissue site <b>104</b>. The ability to rectify leaks may increase the reliability of the therapy and reduce power consumption.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">As the dressing <b>124</b> comes into contact with fluid from the tissue site <b>104</b>, the fluid may move through the apertures <b>160</b> toward the fluid management assembly <b>144</b>, <b>244</b>. The fluid management assembly <b>144</b>, <b>244</b> may wick or otherwise move the fluid through the interface manifold <b>120</b> and away from the tissue site <b>104</b>. As described above, the interface manifold <b>120</b> may be adapted to communicate fluid from the tissue site <b>104</b> rather than store the fluid. Thus, the fluid management assembly <b>144</b>, <b>244</b> may be more absorbent than the interface manifold <b>120</b>. The fluid management assembly <b>144</b>, <b>244</b> being more absorbent than the interface manifold <b>120</b> may provide an absorbent gradient through the dressing <b>124</b> that attracts fluid from the tissue site <b>104</b> or the interface manifold <b>120</b> to the fluid management assembly <b>144</b>, <b>244</b>. Thus, in some embodiments, the fluid management assembly <b>144</b>, <b>244</b> may be adapted to wick, pull, draw, or otherwise attract fluid from the tissue site <b>104</b> through the interface manifold <b>120</b>. In the fluid management assembly <b>144</b>, <b>244</b>, the fluid may initially come into contact with the first wicking layer <b>176</b>, <b>276</b>. The first wicking layer <b>176</b>, <b>276</b> may distribute the fluid laterally along the surface of the first wicking layer <b>176</b>, <b>276</b> as described above for absorption and storage within the absorbent layer <b>184</b>, <b>284</b>. Similarly, fluid may come into contact with the second wicking layer <b>180</b>, <b>280</b> and may be distributed laterally along the surface of the second wicking layer <b>180</b>, <b>280</b> for absorption within the absorbent layer <b>184</b>, <b>284</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 9-11</figref>, a low profile conduit assembly <b>310</b> may be coupled in fluid communication between the dressing <b>124</b> and the reduced-pressure source <b>128</b> (shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) in any suitable manner. In some embodiments, the low profile conduit assembly <b>310</b> may include a low profile conduit <b>320</b>, a sealing apparatus <b>330</b>, and the conduit interface <b>148</b>.</p>

The receiving end <b>334</b> may have a receiving end aperture <b>342</b>, and the transmitting end <b>338</b> may have a transmitting end aperture <b>346</b>. The receiving end <b>334</b> and the receiving end aperture <b>342</b> may be in fluid communication with the transmitting end <b>338</b> and the transmitting end aperture <b>346</b> through the length of the low profile conduit <b>320</b>. The conduit interface <b>148</b> may be coupled in fluid communication with the receiving end aperture <b>342</b>. Thus, the conduit interface <b>148</b> may be in fluid communication with the transmitting end <b>338</b> through the length of the low profile conduit <b>320</b>. The sealing apparatus <b>330</b> may be positioned about the transmitting end aperture <b>346</b> and between the transmitting end <b>338</b> and the dressing <b>124</b> for bonding the transmitting end <b>338</b> to the dressing <b>124</b> and in fluid communication with the dressing <b>124</b> through the transmitting end aperture <b>346</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">The low profile conduit <b>320</b> may additionally include a manifold material <b>350</b> encapsulated or sealingly enclosed within a sealing member <b>354</b>. The manifold material <b>350</b> may be encapsulated or sealingly enclosed with the sealing member <b>354</b> between the receiving end <b>334</b> and the transmitting end <b>338</b> of the low profile conduit <b>320</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the sealing member <b>354</b> may include a first sealing layer <b>358</b> and a second sealing layer <b>362</b>. The first sealing layer <b>358</b> may have a first periphery bonded to a second periphery of the second sealing layer <b>362</b> around the manifold material <b>350</b> in any suitable manner for forming the sealing member <b>354</b> and encapsulating the manifold material <b>350</b> therein. The sealing member <b>354</b> may be comprised of similar materials described above for the sealing member <b>140</b>. For example, the sealing member <b>354</b> may be an adhesive coated film, such as an Inspire <b>2327</b> drape.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">The manifold material <b>350</b> may include a distribution layer <b>366</b> and an acquisition layer <b>370</b>.

The longitudinal fibers <b>374</b> may be oriented substantially in a longitudinal direction along the length of the low profile conduit <b>320</b>. The acquisition layer <b>370</b> may be comprised of vertical fibers <b>378</b>. The vertical fibers <b>378</b> may be oriented substantially vertical or normal relative to the longitudinal fibers <b>374</b> and the length of the low profile conduit <b>320</b>. The distribution layer <b>366</b> may be coupled to the acquisition layer <b>370</b>. Fluid communication voids <b>382</b> may be located or defined between and among the longitudinal fibers <b>374</b> of the distribution layer <b>366</b> and the vertical fibers <b>378</b> of the acquisition layer <b>370</b>. The fluid communication voids <b>382</b> may provide fluid communication through the manifold material <b>350</b> and the low profile conduit <b>320</b> even when exposed to a force, such as a compression force depicted in <figref>FIG. 10</figref> as arrow <b>384</b>, for example. When exposed to such a force, the longitudinal fibers <b>374</b> and the vertical fibers <b>378</b> may engage one another to substantially preclude blockage, closure, or other interference with the fluid communication voids <b>382</b> in providing fluid communication through the low profile conduit <b>320</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">The manifold material <b>350</b> may be a non-woven material such as, for example, a polyester non-woven or Libeltex TDL4. In some embodiments, other non-woven structures may be used for the manifold material <b>350</b>, such as Libeltex TDL2, or laminations with fiber or foam structures. Further, other materials for the sealing member <b>354</b> may be used, such as polyurethane film, films with and without adhesive, and high Moisture Vapor Transfer Rate (MVTR) films. The high MVTR films may provide for evaporation of condensate.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">In some embodiments, patterns or shallow ridges may be embossed into the sealing member <b>354</b> to aid pressure transfer and further resist crushing.

      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">In operation, the reduced-pressure source <b>128</b> may be activated to provide reduced pressure to the receiving end <b>334</b> of the low profile conduit <b>320</b>. For example, the conduit interface <b>148</b> may be fluidly coupled to the receiving end <b>334</b>, and the conduit <b>196</b> may be fluidly coupled between the conduit interface <b>148</b> and the reduced-pressure source <b>128</b> analogous to the previously described embodiments. The reduced pressure may be transmitted through the fluid communication voids <b>382</b> in the manifold material <b>350</b>. Fluid flow associated with the application of the reduced pressure may be gaseous and substantially free of liquid. Thus, the low profile conduit <b>320</b> may be substantially free of liquid during operation. Further, the flow rate may be equal or less than about 100 cubic centimeters per minute.

Referring to <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, during the testing, 50cc of saline was added to the dressing <b>124</b> while reduced pressure was applied to the dressing <b>124</b> through the 500 millimeter long low profile conduit. The reduced pressure or vacuum level applied to the dressing <b>124</b> through the 500 millimeter low profile conduit, measured at the reduced-pressure source <b>128</b>, is plotted in <figref>FIG. 12</figref> versus the amount of saline added to the dressing <b>124</b>. This reduced pressure data, measured at the reduced-pressure source <b>128</b> for the 500 millimeter low profile conduit test, established a baseline reduced-pressure plot that can be compared to the reduced pressure experienced at other locations in the system during the addition of the saline.

This reduced pressure data, measured at the reduced-pressure source <b>128</b> for the 900 millimeter low profile conduit test, established a baseline reduced-pressure plot that can be compared to the reduced pressure experienced at other locations in the system during the addition of the saline. Thus, also plotted in <figref>FIG. 13</figref> is the reduced pressure or vacuum level experienced by the other dressing <b>124</b> and the low profile conduit, measured at locations <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, versus the amount of saline added to the other dressing <b>124</b>.

Therefore, both <figref>FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> illustrate that no significant drop in reduced pressure transfer occurred during the testing through either the 500 millimeter low profile conduit or the 900 millimeter low profile conduit when measured at locations <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">Accordingly, the low profile conduit <b>320</b> may provide a flexible pressure transfer conduit capable of transmitting reduced pressure when exposed to a force, such as a crushing force or compression force.

The low profile conduit <b>320</b> may also experience a force or compression force from being kinked or folded. However, the configuration of the low profile conduit <b>320</b> may also provide for the transmission of reduced pressure when kinked or folded. Further, the low profile conduit <b>320</b> may enable the caregiver to choose a route from the dressing <b>124</b>, or another dressing, to the reduced-pressure source <b>128</b> or the therapy device <b>130</b> that is best or convenient for the patient, rather than being limited to routes less susceptible to being crushed and better suited for transfer of pressure. The low profile conduit <b>320</b> may present less risk of causing discomfort or pressure point related injuries to the patient. The flexibility of the low profile conduit <b>320</b> may enable it to be folded, permitting smaller packaging pouches to be used.
