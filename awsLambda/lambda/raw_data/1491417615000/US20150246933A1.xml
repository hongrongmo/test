      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">This invention relates to epidithiodiketopiperazine compounds, pharmaceutical compositions based thereon and methods of treating, reducing or inhibiting transcription and translation of hypoxia-inducible genes.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The high rate of cancer morbidity and mortality remains a major concern among the population in Western societies. In addition to having an impact on the cancer patients and members of their immediate families, cancer inflicts a large burden on society. The cost of cancer treatment and patient care is typically high and contributes to increased cost of health insurance and results, in turn, in a higher percentage of uninsured people and, consequently, in an increased economic burden when uninsured people become sick or injured. Cancer also causes a significant negative impact on businesses due to prolonged absences of cancer patients from work.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Although methods of cancer treatment have greatly improved over the years, many challenges, most notably relapse among cancer patients and difficulties in treating patients in advanced stages of cancer as well as with metastatic diseases or with systemic cancers such as leukemia or lymphoma, remain. For example, improved diagnostic methods combined with better surgical techniques allow oncologists to remove tumor with greater confidence, while at the same time minimizing the removal of normal tissue. As such, the recovery time for patients can be decreased and psychological impact is reduced. However, surgery is only one of the few useful tools for treating patients with localized, non-metastatic tumors or the tumors which are minimally spread.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Chemotherapy is another treatment of choice for certain types of cancers. However, chemotherapeutic methods are generally not specific for tumor cells as compared to normal cells. As a result, chemotherapy is generally associated with serious side effects and can be particularly devastating to the patient's immune system and to rapidly dividing tissues, such as tissues in liver, kidneys, gut, and epithelium.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Cancer progression is dependent on angiogenesis, or the sprouting of new blood vessels that penetrate every solid tumor. The rapid tissue proliferation which defines cancer results in a number of adaptive cellular responses, primary among which are the distinct but related processes of angiogenesis and increased glycolysis. Angiogenesis is primarily driven by several mitogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors play a key role. While neovascularization is essential in embryonic development, it is highly undesirable in cancers because these nascent vessels infuse tumor tissue and provide them with increased oxygenation and nutrient content for more rapid growth. Angiogenesis is particularly pernicious because it poses a double threat: not only it accelerates tumor growth, but also provides a gateway to metastasis via the newly formed vasculature. As it is metastatic growth which exerts the greatest impact on overall patient survival, angiogenesis represents a critical chemotherapeutic target. Moreover, vascular targets should not engender resistance to therapy because they are not subject to the multiple mutations which occur in malignant cells. One of the primary advantages of targeting the blood supply (vasculature) is that, unlike cells in the cancerous tissues, the cells that comprise blood vessels are genetically stable and, therefore, should have diminished resistance to therapy.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">As tumor cells continue to proliferate, they are forced farther away from the blood supply carrying needed oxygen and nutrients for metabolic processes and therefore cannot attain adequate oxygen perfusion. The ensuing hypoxia<sup>1 </sup>results in a switch to an anaerobic metabolism which selects for cells with upregulated glycolysis.<sup>2 </sup>Enhanced glycolytic function then leads to increased generation of lactic acid which lowers intracellular pH and can facilitate the degradation of the extracellular matrix and basement membrane, thereby promoting angiogenesis.<sup>3 </sup>Glycolysis confers a significant advantage in overcoming growth restraints during tumorigenesis<sup>4,5 </sup>and most primary metastatic tumors demonstrate significant upregulation of glycolytic enzymes like hexokinases 1 and 2 and glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3.<sup>6 </sup></p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Hypoxia is one of the most important hallmarks of solid tumors that plays a vital role in cell proliferation, signaling and growth.<sup>7 </sup>A typical neoplasm is usually devoid of blood vessels in its early stage. The rapidly proliferating cells contribute to development of hypoxia.<sup>8 </sup>Despite the fact that cell proliferation decreases in those parts of a tumor that are away from blood vessels,<sup>9 </sup>they tend to select for more aggressive cellular phenotypes. Moreover, it has been reported that the hypoxic tissue away from the blood vessels give rise to cells that have lost sensitivity to p53-mediated apoptosis.<sup>7 </sup></p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Hypoxia also leads to upregulation of genes involved in drug resistance, such as P-glycoproteins<sup>10,11 </sup>in addition to the fact that lack of adequate blood supply to hypoxic cells severely impairs the delivery of drug to these cells.<sup>12,13 </sup>Most importantly, from a transcriptional standpoint, hypoxia results in an upregulation of genes involved in angiogenesis<sup>14 </sup>and tumor invasion<sup>15 </sup>resulting in more aggressive cancer phenotype.<sup>16 </sup></p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In cells and tissues, response to hypoxia is primarily mediated by the family of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, among which hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) plays a major role. It is a heterodimeric transcription factor which mediates regulation of many key genes upregulated in a hypoxic state (<figref>FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>).<sup>17 </sup>During normoxic conditions, the a-subunit of HIF1 is regulated by hydroxylation at proline residues 402 and 564;<sup>18 </sup>these modifications serve as a docking site for the von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) protein<sup>19 </sup>to bind HIF1 and tag it with ubiquitin for subsequent proteasomal degradation.<sup>20 </sup>However, under hypoxic conditions, HIF1Î± accumulates, enters the nucleus and dimerizes with its beta subunit, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT, or HIF1Î²),<sup>21 </sup>It binds to the promoter region of hypoxia inducible genes possessing hypoxia-response elements (HREs),<sup>22 </sup>including VEGF, c-Met, EPO, and GLUT-1.<sup>23,24 </sup>Because low oxygen levels also preclude hydroxylation of another regulatory site at Asn803,<sup>25-30 </sup>the coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP)/p300<sup>31-33 </sup>is recruited via binding the C-terminal domain of HIF1Î± and promotes elevated expression levels of hypoxia-inducible genes (<figref>FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>).<sup>34-36 </sup>In many tumor cells where oncogenic mutations in RAS, SRC and HER2/NEU/ERBB2 are found, high levels of HIF1Î± have been detected even under well-oxygenated condition.<sup>37 </sup></p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">It has been shown that antisense construct of HIF1Î± eradicates in vivo a small transplanted thymic lymphoma and even increases the efficacy of immunotherapy against larger tumors.<sup>38 </sup>Small molecule inhibitors of microtubules, such as 2-methoxyestradiol, vincristine and paclitaxel have been shown to reduce HIF1Î± levels in vitro and also reduce tumor growth and vascularization.<sup>39 </sup>However, it is not clearly understood whether the effects shown in tumor growth reduction is due to microtubule inhibition or reduction of HIF1Î± levels.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">HIF1 interacts primarily with the CH<sub>1 </sub>domain of CBP/300 through a series of key cysteine residues and this interaction is driven by hydrophobic forces. It was shown that the natural product chetomin (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>, vide infra), a fungal metabolite of the <i>Chaetomium </i>sp., demonstrated potent and specific inhibition of the HIF/p300 complex. Because p300/CBP is absolutely required for HIF1-mediated transactivation, blocking the association of HIF1 and p300/CBP effectively downregulates transcription.</p>

However, peptides composed of less than 15 amino acid residues do not generally form Î±-helical structures at physiological conditions once excised from the protein environment. Notably, the only attempt of disruption of C-TAD/CH<sub>1 </sub>interaction with the a-helix was an approach reported by Kung et al.<sup>40 </sup>In this study, C-TAD was expressed as a fusion protein with Gal4 which stabilized the domain. The resulting protein suppressed transcription of hypoxia-inducible genes and had an inhibitory effect on the growth of modified human tumor cells in nude mice xenograft models. However, difficulties with systemic delivery and complications arising from the use of retroviruses in cells and tissues hamper their widespread adaptation.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0103">Because interaction of HIF1Î± C-TAD with transcriptional co-activator p300/CBP is a point of significant amplification of biological response, its disruption with designed protein ligands could be an effective means of suppressing aerobic glycolysis and angiogenesis in cancers.<sup>41-43 </sup>Although the contact surface of the HIF1Î± C-TAD with p300/CBP is extensive (3393 â«<sup>2</sup>), the inhibition of this protein-protein interaction by direct interactions is difficult.

      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0106">Although inhibition of nuclear protein-protein interactions with small molecules in the past has proven to be difficult,<sup>46 </sup>recent screens for high-affinity protein ligands have resulted in several remarkable accomplishments.<sup>44,47-53 </sup>Two small molecules, chaetocin (CTC),<sup>54 </sup>and chetomin (CTM),<sup>55 </sup>(<figref>FIG. 2</figref>), have been shown to inhibit the interaction between HIF1â¡ C-TAD and p300/CBP and to attenuate hypoxia-inducible transcription, although the exact mechanism of its action remains unclear.<sup>44 </sup>Despite the initial encouraging reports, further design of inhibitors of HIF1 pathway is needed, because both compounds induced coagulative necrosis, anemia and leukocytosis in experimental animals.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0107">Chaetocin and chetomin are two epidithiodiketopiperazine<sup>56 </sup>(ETP) metabolites from the filamentous fungi of the <i>Chaetomium </i>species that have been previously characterized as having antimicrobial activity.<sup>57,58 </sup>Total synthesis of these natural products has been very challenging and for chetomin has not been reported to date, presumably due to the lack of methods for enantioselective sulfenylation of the diketopiperazine rings and the instability of the disulfide bridge toward bases and reducing agents. Under physiological conditions, the bridged disulfide moiety can exist either in disulfide or dithiol forms and is thought to be essential for biological activity of this class of natural products. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results and by the recent work of Bernardo and Waring who have shown that only the natural (oxidized) form of epidithiodiketopiperazine is then reduced actively concentrated in live cells in a glutathione-dependent manner.<sup>59 </sup>Intracellular levels of the ETP can be up to 1500-fold greater than the applied concentration, and ETP in the cells exists almost exclusively in the reduced form.<sup>59 </sup></p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0108">We hypothesized that two properly positioned redox-active ETP rings in chaetocin and chetomin may play an important role in high affinity bidentate binding of these compounds to cysteine-histidine rich, Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein domains. The rigidity of the structures of CTC and CTM makes it easier to predict their biologically active conformations. Despite the marked difference in structure of the central scaffold, the two molecules assume low energy conformations with very similar orientations of the ETP rings.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0109">The synthetic dimeric epidithiodiketopiperazines were designed by connecting the two ETP rings via a semi-rigid central scaffold. Such small molecules may be capable of disrupting the global fold and, as a result, the recruitment of p300/CBP by the HIF1alpha. To confirm this, we designed ETPs LS69 and LS72 where the positioning of the ETP rings is similar to chetomin and examined their effect on transcription of HIF-inducible genes (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). A molecule structurally similar to LS69 that is lacking the disulfide bridges, NP481, was also designed and used as a control compound (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0110">Synthesis of Dimeric Epidithiodiketopiperazines</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0111">In our synthetic plan, we formed the disulfide bridge in synthetic intermediates at the latest possible stage. We introduce the protected disulfide at an early stage, with the hope that the stability of the protected disulfide group would improve and consequently facilitate the synthesis.<sup>60 </sup>The disulfide bridge could then be regenerated at a later stage.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0112">Our synthetic plan involved three key transformations (<figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>): i) protection of the disulfide bridge as a bicyclic thioacetal, functionalization of the C-3 and C-6 positions of the thioacetal ring via carbanion chemistry, and regeneration of the disulfide bridge. Bromination of the commercially available 1,4-dimethyl-2,5-piperazinedione 1 followed by reaction of 2 with potassium thioacetate and subsequent removal of the acetyl group in 3 under acidic conditions provided a mixture of cis- and trans-dithiols 4 in good overall yield (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>). The thioacetal 5 was obtained via a reaction of dithiols with p-anisaldehyde and boron trifluoride etherate in high yield. The formation of thioacetal is known to proceed from both cis- and trans-isomers of dithiol.<sup>60 </sup>Regioselective deprotonation of 5 with a strong base at the bridgehead positions<sup>61 </sup>and subsequent reaction with benzyloxymethyl chloride (BOM chloride) afforded monosubstituted thioacetal 7 in good yield. Likewise, reaction of 5 with 2 equivalents of a strong base, followed by addition of two equivalents of BOM chloride provided compound 9. Regioselective removal of a single benzyl group in 9 could be carried out with one equivalent of boron trichloride, resulting in the formation of alcohol 10. Both benzyl groups could be removed by treating 9 with two equivalents of boron trichloride, resulting in a formation of a diol 12, which was acetylated to give diacetate 13. Regeneration of the disulfide bridge in thioacetals 7, 10 and 13 resulted in the formation of the single-ring ETP compounds 8, 11 (LS75) and 14, respectively. All products were purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC and their identity and purity was confirmed by NMR and mass spectrometry.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0113">Preparation of the bridged thioacetal dimers is outlined in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. Deprotonation of the bridgehead position in thioacetal 7 with strong base, followed by reaction with excess of Î±,Î±-dibromo-p-xylene produced intermediate 15 which was converted into thioacetal dimers 16 and 21 by reaction with second equivalent of the carbanion generated from 7. Removal of the benzyl protecting group was accomplished by treating 16 or 21 with boron trichloride. The conversion of the protected thioacetals into bridged ETP was carried out as follows: oxidation with m-chloroperbenzoic acid resulted in the formation of monosulfoxides which were converted in situ to the ETP by treatment with 70% perchloric acid in THF. The products 19 (LS69) and 24 (LS72) were purified by preparative TLC or by reverse phase HPLC using 5-95% gradient of acetonitrile and water with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), To facilitate characterization, the alcohols 19 and 24 were also acetylated to produce diacetyl derivatives 20 and 26.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0114">To compare the biological effects of the ETPs and demonstrate importance of the disulfide bridge, a xylylene-bridged bis(1,4-piperazine-2,5-dione, DKP) NP481 was also synthesized. This compound is structurally similar to ETP LS69, but it is lacking the disulfide bridge. The activities of the synthetic ETPs could be directly compared with the activity of the DKP compound in cell culture.</p>

      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0115">LS69 and LS72 Bind CH<sub>1 </sub>Domain of p300</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0116">Prior to undertaking more rigorous biophysical and biological characterization of dimeric ETPs LS69 and LS72, it was important to first characterize its thermodynamic binding properties toward the target, p300 CH<sub>1 </sub>domain. We conducted SPR experiments in the presence of DTT to mimic the reducing environment that would be found in the intracellular milieu. From the SPR sensorgrams it is clear that both LS69 and LS72 bind directly to the GST-tagged CH<sub>1 </sub>domain of human p300 (aa residues 323-423) with high affinity.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0117">For LS69, we determined the rate of association (k<sub>a</sub>) to be 6.97Ã10<sup>3</sup>Â±0.157 M<sup>â1 </sup>s<sup>â1 </sup>and rate of dissociation k<sub>d </sub>obtained for LS69 in the wash step following the association step was 1.33Ã10<sup>â2</sup>Â±1.72Ã10<sup>â4 </sup>s<sup>â1</sup>. Therefore the binding constant measured by SPR analysis for LS69 binding to CH<sub>1 </sub>domain of p300 was âoff rateâ/âon rateâ which gives a value of K<sub>D</sub>=1.09 Î¼M.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0118">For LS72, the rate of association k<sub>a </sub>obtained by SPR analysis was 4.25Ã10<sup>3</sup>Â±85.8 while in the following wash step the rate of dissociation k<sub>d </sub>obtained was 1.54 f 0.14Ã10<sup>â2 </sup>s<sup>â1</sup>. Thus the binding constant obtained for LS72 is K<sub>D</sub>=3.62 Î¼M. Based on these data, both LS69 and LS72 reversibly bind to p300-CH1-GST and exhibit a rapid on-rate and a slow off-rate with gradual dissociation from the protein immobilized on the chip surface. Control DKP NP481 did not bind at any concentration tested up to 5.0Ã10â²<sup>5 </sup>M (data not shown).</p>

      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0119">We first examined the effect of designed ETPs on activation of the HIF1 inducible promoters. We used MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line that contains chromosomally integrated vector constructs with five copies of hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) derived from the 5â²-untranslated region (UTR) of the human VEGF gene.<sup>62 </sup>They showed excellent transcriptional activation at low oxygen tension relevant to tumor hypoxia.<sup>63 </sup>These cell lines were used in our luciferase reporter assays. In the course of the experiment, cells were incubated with ETPs LS69, LS72, LS75 and DKP compound NP481. In parallel, untreated cells with only vehicle (DMSO) added, were used as controls. Hypoxia conditions were induced by incubating cells with 300 uM desferrioxamine mesylate for 18 h. Cells were harvested, lysed and the levels of luciferase were determined by a luminometer.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0120">Results of our measurement are illustrated in <figref>FIG. 8</figref> with bar graphs illustrating ratio of induced to uninduced luciferase levels. Without compounds, the levels of expression of the reporter gene increase about 56-fold by placing cells in hypoxia conditions. Treatment of cells with chetomin CTM and synthetic ETP compounds LS69 and LS72 led to significant reduction in hypoxia-inducible promoter activity (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>). The observed effects were dose-dependent. In contrast, treatment with single-ring ETP LS75 resulted only in a small reduction in promoter activity. Likewise, treatment with the DKP compound NP481 resulted in a minimal reduction of promoter activity and did not show dose dependence.</p>
      <heading id="h-00015-en" level="2">Inhibition of Hypoxia-Inducible Transcription In Vitro</heading>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0121">We used real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays to determine the relative levels of VEGF mRNA in hypoxic cells treated with ETP compounds and control DKP compound. In parallel, cells treated with vehicle were used as controls. mRNA level of Î²-glucuronidase gene was used as a control in determining the relative levels of transcription.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0122">In cultured MCF7 cells under hypoxic conditions, synthetic ETP compounds LS69 and LS72 downregulated VEGF (<figref>FIG. 9</figref>) gene at levels that are comparable or in certain cases surpass the levels observed with chetomin. Thus, LS69 at 600 nM concentration inhibits VEGF expression by Ë65%, which is near the VEGF mRNA levels in the uninduced (normoxic) cells. The observed effects were dose-dependent. The control compound NP481 has shown no inhibitory effect on levels of VEGF.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0123">We also tested the effect of our compounds on the levels of expression of VEGF gene in a different cell line. HeLa cells were selected for this assay.

      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0124">c-Met gene is another important downstream gene target of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor system. It has five repeats of HRE sequence in its promoter region and Comoglio et al have shown that HRE 4 and HRE 5 are mainly responsible for the hypoxia inducible transcription of c-Met gene. Mutation or deletion of HRE 4 and HRE 5 in the promoter sequence of c-Met gene significantly diminishes the hypoxia inducible induction of its transcription. The mRNA as well as the protein levels of c-Met are significantly upregulated under hypoxia in many cancer cell lines and most of these cancer cell lines are typically metastatic in nature.</p>

      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0125">One potential issue that arises with the use of ETPs as transcriptional inhibitors is their cytotoxicity. Therefore, careful assessment of the cytotoxicity is crucial for every small molecule that acts as a transcriptional inhibitor in order to rule out non-specific, global effects on transcriptional machinery.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0126">We performed cytotoxicity experiments in order to obtain the EC<sub>50 </sub>values of LS72 in MCF7 breast cancer cell line and A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line. The goal was to determine the window of viable concentrations and perform our transcription inhibition experiments at concentrations significantly below the BC<sub>50 </sub>values in these cell lines.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0127">In our previous work<sup>64 </sup>we reported the EC<sub>50 </sub>value for chetomin in MCF7 cells to be 180 nM. We found the newly designed LS72 to be much less cytotoxic towards MCF7 cells as compared to chetomin. In the MTT cell cytotoxicity assay in MCF7 cells, the EC50 value obtained was 547 nM after 24 h treatment with LS72 (<figref>FIG. 10</figref>). Based on this EC50 value of LS72 in MCF7 cells we chose to measure its effect on HIF inducible transcription at a maximum concentration of 400 nM in MCF7 cells. This is important in order to minimize the nonspecific effects on mRNA levels due to reduction in cell viability.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0128">Cell line A549 is lung epithelial adenocarcinoma of non-small cell type that is known to exhibit significant upregulation of key HIF1Î± inducible genes, such as c-Met, VEGF and Glut.â² under hypoxic conditions. In our viability assays in this cell line ETPs showed less cytotoxicity as compared to MCF7 cell line. After 24 h treatment with both chetomin and LS72 in Kahn modified F-12 media, an EC<sub>50 </sub>of &gt;10 Î¼M as observed. Therefore the treatment of the cells was extended to 48 h in order to better determine its cytotoxicity.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0129">MTT cytotoxicity assay was carried out for chetomin and LS72 in A549 cell line for 48 h. The EC<sub>50 </sub>for LS72 obtained from this assay after 48 h treatment was 2.8 Î¼M (<figref>FIGS. 11-12</figref>). This value is about five times higher than the EC50 value obtained in MCF7 cell line after 24 h treatment. These data suggest that A549 cell line is much more robust toward treatment as compared to MCF7 cell line. In addition, LS72 is clearly much less toxic to cells as compared to chetomin. Since ETP motifs are common in both LS72 and chetomin, we could only speculate that higher toxicity of chetomin may be due to its cyclotryptophan motif, that is absent in LS72.</p>

      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0130">Finding of a good in vitro model that consistently displays high transcriptional activation of hypoxia-inducible genes turned out to be a challenging task. After evaluating several cell lines we focused our attention on A549 cells, a non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma cell line. It has been reported that A549 cell line produces robust upregulation of key HIF-inducible genes under hypoxia conditions. Specifically, Comoglio et al.<sup>15 </sup>reported that under hypoxia c-Met mRNA level is significantly upregulated in A549 cell line.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0131">After tests with various serum levels in the media and hypoxia induction methods, the conditions that worked remarkably and consistently well for the induction of HIF1Î± dependent genes were to keep A549 cells in 2% serum followed by treating cells with compound or control in the media with 0.2% serum for 48 h (<figref>FIG. 13</figref>). Under these conditions while hypoxia bag was the best option for induction of the LOX gene, the best hypoxic response leading to upregulation of many other HIF1Î± inducible genes was treatment with 300 Î¼M DFO.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0132">
        <figref>FIG. 13</figref> shows the effect of LS72 treatment on the levels of three important genes VEGF, Glut1 and c-Met which are known to be upregulated in many solid tumors under hypoxic conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0133">Treatment with LS72 resulted in a significant reduction in the hypoxic response of VEGF, Glut1 and c-Met genes. VEGF levels were reduced by 50%, whereas Glut1 mRNA levels were reduced more than 60%. c-Met was also significantly downregulated, essentially reaching its normoxic levels (<figref>FIG. 13</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0134">LOX (lysyl oxidase) is another gene that is upregulated under hypoxia and the protein is involved in regulating the extracellular matrix during invasive behavior and metastasis of cancer tissue<sup>65</sup>. LOX gene showed better induction with hypoxia bag after 48 h and showed significant downregulation in the transcriptional activity after treatment with LS72. CXCR4 is a gene that is essential for chemotaxis of stem cells and progenitor cells during healing of an injury that is also implicated in cancer stem cells migration<sup>66</sup>. SDF1-CXCR4 axis leads to chemotaxis of progenitor and stem cells to the cancer tissue or wound followed by their differentiation. In our model system of A549 cells CXCR4 is also upregulated more than 100-fold after chemical induction of hypoxia with DFO or hypoxia bag. Upon treatment with LS72 at 400 nM concentration, excellent inhibition of the transcriptional activity was observed for CXCR4 gene (<figref>FIG. 14</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0135">Overall, A549 cell line under the conditions mentioned above became a very good model for studying HIF1Î± inducible gene expression. All the five genes mentioned above not only showed high up-regulation of HIF1Î± inducible transcription of many key genes involved in tumorigenesis but also under the given conditions showed very little change in the transcriptional activity under normoxia in the presence of LS72.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0136">After obtaining great transcriptional induction for the five genes VEGF, c-Met, Glut1, LOX and CXCR4 which are upregulated by HIF1Î± transcriptional system and are downregulated upon treatment with 400 nM of LS72, the next logical step was to study the drug dose response. The modulation of HIF1Î± inducible transcription with LS72 was studied at three different concentrations of 100 nM, 400 nM and 1600 nM.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0137">The hypoxia induction was done at a confluency of 85% cells in serum free F-12K medium with 300 Î¼M DFO.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0138">For each concentration of LS72 control samples were also present, where the cells were treated with LS72 but without induction of hypoxia. The controls showed that at the three different concentrations of LS72 in normoxia the VEGF transcription levels were not changed significantly, underlining the fact that in these conditions LS72 did not show increase or decrease in the transcriptional levels due to stress or some other pathway. Under hypoxia LS72 showed dose dependent decrease in the HIF1Î± inducible transcription of VEGF gene (<figref>FIG. 15</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0139">c-Met gene under these conditions of hypoxic induction to highly confluent cells showed enhanced upregulation of its transcription. c-Met mRNA was up-regulated more than 5 folds in hypoxia. Dose-dependent decrease in transcriptional upregulation was observed for c-Met upon treatment with LS72 (<figref>FIG. 16</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0140">Glut1 which showed 10-fold induction in highly confluent cells. Glut1 also shows dose dependent decrease of hypoxic transcriptional up-regulation at 100 nM, 400 nM and 1600 nM of LS72 (<figref>FIG. 17</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0141">CXCR4 is a G-protein coupled receptor that is upregulated under hypoxic conditions. We chose A549 cells and induced the hypoxia with DFO and found that in 85% confluent cells the levels of CXCR4 gene were transcriptionally overexpressed more than 650-fold. Upon treatment with LS72 at 400 nM and 1600 nM concentration a dose-dependent decrease in mRNA levels of CXCR4 could be observed <figref>FIG. 18</figref>). These finding not only show that CXCR4 is induced transcriptionally in A549 cells under hypoxic conditions but that it can be downregulated with small molecules targeting HIF1Î± pathway.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0000">Downregulation of VEGF and c-Met Protein Levels with LS72</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0142">After obtaining significant downregulation of transcription for several key HIF-1 inducible genes including VEGF and c-Met, we studied the protein levels of VEGF and c-Met in order to see whether the downregulation observed in the mRNA levels is also translated into the downregulation of the corresponding protein levels. Western blots were done to measure the protein levels for VEGF and c-Met in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines respectively treated with LS72. VEGF protein levels showed significant downregulation with chetomin (200 nM) and LS72 (400 nM) in MCF7 cells under HIF1Î± induction with 300 Î¼M DFO (<figref>FIG. 19</figref><i>a</i>). c-Met proteins levels also showed significant downregulation in the HIF1Î± induced protein levels upon treatment with chetomin (200 nM) and LS72 (400 nM) in MDA-MB-231 cells (<figref>FIG. 19</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
      <heading id="h-00017-en" level="2">Gene Expression Profiling and Microarray Analysis</heading>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0143">Since the target proteins p300 and CBP are pleiotropic multidomain coactivators, their CH<sub>1 </sub>regions contain binding sites for multiple transcription factors. One potential concern of the use of ETPs for gene regulation is specificity, because inhibiting the interaction between CBP/p300 and transcription factors other than HIF1Î± may result in large numbers of affected genes. To rule out nonspecific genome-wide effects of ETPs, we conducted in vitro gene expression profiling experiments with LS72 using Affymetrix Human Gene ST 1.0 Arrays containing oligonucleotide sequences representing 28,869 transcripts.<sup>67,68 </sup></p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0144">In order to interrogate cellular genome for global effects, MCF7 cells treated with LS72 at 400 nM were used. Treatment of cells with LS72 at a concentration of 400 nM affected the expression of only 178 genes at â§2.0 fold levels (<figref>FIG. 20</figref>). By comparison, treatment with DFO alone changed levels of 329 genes â§2.0 fold. Of these, 88 genes were downregulated â§2.0 fold and 90-upregulated by â§2.0 fold, respectively. In cells treated with LS72 under DFO-induced hypoxia conditions, we identified 190 genes were affected by this compound. Clustering analysis was performed to identify similarities in the expression profiles between different treatments (<figref>FIG. 19</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0145">
        <figref>FIG. 21</figref> shows agglomerative clustering of genes under different conditions of hypoxia and treatment of LS72 (400 nM). The clustering shows that in many genes the effect of LS72 under hypoxia is to nullify the effect of hypoxia such that many genes transcriptional levels behave similar to that as seen in vehicle i.e. normoxia without LS72 treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0146">The expression profile of cells treated with LS72 under DFO-induced hypoxia is largely different from the profile under DFO alone. However, the profiles of the cells treated with LS72 under DFO-induced hypoxia and cells under normoxia conditions are showing regions of similarity. This suggests, that treatment with LS72 reduces the effect of DFO treatment on certain group of genes, as expected for transcriptional inhibitor that affects hypoxia-inducible genes. It is not entirely surprising that there is some overlap in genes affected by both LS72 and DFO given the complexity of cellular signaling pathways involved in the hypoxic response. The results also clearly demonstrate specificity of LS72 in its effect on hypoxia-induction in the context of the entire genome.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0147">Table 1 lists important genes that are downregulated under hypoxia with 400 nM LS72 treatment in MCF7 cells. The data extracted from the lists of genes that show &gt;2-fold change.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0148">Interestingly, many genes that belong to solute carrier (SLC) family of proteins were down-regulated under hypoxia with LS72. They are listed in Table 2. This shows that under hypoxia solute carrier proteins are upregulated to facilitate higher uptake and secretion of molecules in the cells and LS72 has reversed this trend.</p>
      <heading id="h-00018-en" level="2">In Vivo Study of the Efficacy of LS72 in Mouse Tumor Xenografts Model Using Intravital Microscopy</heading>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0149">Tumor spheroids from N2O2 (breast carcinoma) were prepared and implanted subcutaneously into the nude mice. Tumors were allowed to vascularize for 10-14 days after which mice were injected on Day 0 with 1 mg/kg of (Â±)-LS72 via tail vein. From Day 8 to Day 13 mice were daily injected with 2 mg/kg of (Â±)-LS72. Intravital microscopy (IVM) images, obtained on specified days are shown in <figref>FIG. 22</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0150">
        <figref>FIG. 23</figref> is shows quantification of the tumor volume obtained from the IVM images. The data clearly shows that in mice #1 and #2, injected with (Â±)-LS72 the tumor vasculature and tumor growth are significantly suppressed. In the course of these experiments, (Â±)-LS72 showed very low toxicity to mice, as confirmed by observation of the behavior of the animals and monitoring of their body weights. This low toxicity of our designed bis-ETP is giving it a significant advantage in vivo over the natural bis-ETP chetomin, which is reported to be toxic and even lethal to animals, because mice treated with chetomin do not survive after five days of consecutive injection.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0151">In our study, mice treated with (Â±)-LS72 survived the 14-day treatment and did not show any signs of acute toxicity. This study validates, efficacy of (0-LS72 as an inhibitor of HIF-1 inducible gene expression in cancer cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in mouse xenograft model in vivo. (Â±)-LS72 is significantly less toxic than chetomin within the tested range of therapeutic concentrations sufficient to maintain the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0152">Additional experiments were carried out where tumors in mice were allowed to vascularize for 10-14 days after which mice were injected on Days 0, 8, 10, and 12 with 1 mg/kg of meso-LS72 via tail vein. Intravital microscopy (IVM) images on Days were obtained as described above. The data shows that mice injected with meso-LS72 the tumor vasculature and tumor growth are also significantly suppressed. In the course of these experiments, meso-LS72 also showed very low toxicity to mice, as confirmed by observation of the behavior of the animals and monitoring of their body weights. This establishes the in vivo efficacy of both (Â±)-LS72 and meso-LS72 in suppressing tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model.</p>
      <heading id="h-00019-en" level="1">DISCUSSION</heading>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0153">As disclosed herein, the compounds of the invention are capable in disrupting the hypoxia inducible transcription in vitro and in vivo with little deleterious effect on cell growth and replication rate. In hypoxic breast carcinoma cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 the designed dimeric 1,572 shows significant downregulation of HIF1Î± inducible transcription of VEGF and c-Met genes and their protein products. In lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, five key genes VEGF c-Met, Glut1, LOX and CXCR4 have been significantly downregulated with LS72 in a dose-dependent manner. Our gene expression profiling experiments provided important insights into the global genomic effects of LS72 under hypoxia conditions. The number and type of genes affected by LS72 is consistent with our previous results suggesting that this compound is a highly specific transcriptional inhibitor with well-defined pharmacogenomic profile.</p>

The mice, usually athymic nude mice (25-30 g body weight), were anesthetized (7.3 mg ketamine hydrochloride and 2.3 mg xylazine per 100 g body weight, intraperitoneal injection) and placed on a heating pad. A titanium frame was placed onto the dorsal skinfold of mice to sandwich the extended double layer of skin. A 15 mm diameter full-thickness circular layer of skin was then excised. The superficial fascia on top of the remaining skin is carefully removed to expose the underlying muscle and subcutaneous tissue which is then covered with another titanium frame with a glass cover slip to form the window chamber. After a recovery period of 1-2 days, tumor spheroids were implanted. Tumor spheroids were formed by plating 50,000 N2O2 cells onto 1% agar-coated 96-well non-tissue culture treated flat bottom dishes (20 Î¼l cells in 100 Î¼l medium) and centrifuging 4 times at 2000 rpm for 15 min, rotating the dish after every centrifugation. The cells were incubated an additional 3-7 days (depending on cell type) at 37Â° C. in 5%Â© CO<sub>2 </sub>in air to form tight spheroids. The tumor spheroids were implanted directly onto the dorsal skin in the window chamber alone. Tumors were allowed to vascularize over 10-14 days before the injection of 1 mg/kg of LS72 compound at Day 0, followed by the daily administration at 2 mg/kg at Days 8-13.</p>
      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0223">Tumor Growth. Analysis of tumor growth with IVM. Tumors were imaged by intravital fluorescence microscopy, as described.<sup>72 </sup>Tumor growth was analyzed off-line from the recorded, digital, grayscale 0 to 256 images using Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, Md.). Tumor growth was determined by quantifying the cumulative fluorescence signal for the tumor over time. The cumulative tumor fluorescence signal was measured by signal summation of all pixels over 75. All growth curves are normalized to the tumor on day 0 after treatment.</p>
