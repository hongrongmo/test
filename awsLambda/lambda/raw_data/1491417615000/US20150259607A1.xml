      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Besides, the pyrolysis furnace <b>115</b> can be a metal material cylinder which can electromagnetically heat the waste plastics in the pyrolysis furnace <b>115</b> and irradiate with microwave to the heated waste plastics so as to crack the waste plastics to produce the plastic gas through a shorter duration and limited energy resource. For example, the pyrolysis furnace <b>115</b> can have a frequency conversion electromagnetic heater (not shown) which transforms electrical energy into heat energy via electromagnetic induction. For instance, the alternating current of 220 V or 380 V and 60 Hz is transformed into a high frequency voltage of 20-40 KHz, and the current of the high frequency voltage flows through a coil to produce an alternating magnetic field of high-speed transformation, so that the conductive metal material produces a number of vortexes in the metal for enabling the metal material cylinder promptly heating itself and thereby warming up the waste plastics. Then, microwave is irradiated to the waste plastics, which are warmed up by the electromagnetic heater. The microwave energy can be absorbed by the waste plastics according to the interaction of the waste plastics and the microwave to reduce the activating energy among the particles of the waste plastics. So, the micro-densification speed of the waste plastics can be accelerated to quicken the sinter of the waste plastics for producing the plastic gas.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The chloride-decomposing device <b>130</b> having ammonia is assembled above the rotary kiln of the pyrolysis furnace <b>115</b>. For example, the chloride-decomposing device <b>130</b> can be an ammonia cylinder assembled above the rotary kiln, when the pyrolysis furnace <b>115</b> produces the plastic gas, the plastic gas will be reacted with the ammonia in the chloride-decomposing device <b>130</b> to remove the chlorides, which is contained in the plastic gas, and produce the first oil gas and the mixed gas without chlorides. Wherein, the mixed gas can be hydrogen, nitrogen and non-condensing gas and the non-condensing gas can be methane, ethane, propane or butane. Furthermore, a gas channel is further assembled between the chloride-decomposing device <b>130</b> and the pyrolysis furnace <b>115</b>, such that the plastic gas floats into the chloride-decomposing device <b>130</b> along the gas channel.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">A first condensation device <b>140</b> is connected with the chloride-decomposing device <b>130</b> via pipe <b>181</b> for enabling the first oil gas, which is produced by the chloride-decomposing device <b>130</b>, floating into the first condensation device <b>140</b> along the pipe <b>181</b>. Wherein, the first oil gas is condensed by the first condensation device <b>140</b> to produce raw oil. For example, the first condensation device <b>140</b> can be a shell and tube condenser having water tubes, when the first oil gas and the mixed gas floats into the first condensation device <b>140</b> and contact to the water tubes, the first oil gas is condensed as fluid to produce the raw oil because the first oil gas has the higher condensation point (boiling point). Besides, because the condensation point (boiling point) of the mixed gas is lower, the mixed gas will not be condensed as fluid even contacts to the water tubes. Moreover, the temporary storage <b>160</b> is assembled under the first condensation device <b>140</b>, so that the raw oil produced by the first condensation device <b>140</b> flows into the temporary storage <b>160</b> along a channel (not shown), i.e. the temporary storage <b>160</b> is used to receive the raw oil.

The vacuum device is connected between the first condensation device <b>140</b> and the temporary storage <b>160</b> and is adjacent to the temporary storage <b>160</b> so as to accelerate the raw oil flowing to the temporary storage <b>160</b>. For example, the vacuum device has a vacuum tank <b>171</b> and a filtering tank <b>172</b>, wherein the filtering tank <b>172</b> is connected with the vacuum tank <b>171</b> and is adjacent to the channel of the temporary storage <b>160</b>, and the vacuum tank <b>171</b> is used to create a vacuum state for the channel to accelerate the raw oil flowing to the temporary storage <b>160</b>. Moreover, the filtering tank <b>172</b> blocks the raw oil and an impurity from flowing into the vacuum tank <b>171</b> as the high-speed flow velocity.</p>

For example, the pipe <b>182</b> is connected with the upper end of the first condensation device <b>140</b> and because the gaseous mixed gas is characterized of floating upwardly, the mixed gas can enter the pipe <b>182</b> and float into the burner <b>120</b> along the pipe <b>182</b>. Consequently, other than burning additional flammable objects or gases, the burner <b>120</b> also burns the mixed gas produced in the refining process by the refining apparatus for recycling waste plastics of the present invention. Therefore, the refining apparatus for recycling waste plastics of the present invention can reduce the amount of the additional flammable objects or gases.</p>

Wherein, the waste gas exhausting apparatus <b>153</b> is a waste gas exhausting pipe which is connected to the burner <b>120</b> of the pyrolysis furnace <b>115</b>, so that the waste gas produced by the fuel burned by the burner <b>120</b> can be exhausted via the waste gas exhausting apparatus <b>153</b>. The sulfur removing washing tower <b>151</b> is assembled in a location of the waste gas exhausting apparatus <b>153</b> and sprays lime water to the waste gas exhausting apparatus <b>153</b>, such that when the waste gas floats through the location where the sulfur removing washing tower <b>151</b> sprays lime water, the waste gas reacts with the lime water to remove the sulfur contained in the waste gas.

Wherein, the difference between the rear end device <b>201</b> of the first embodiment and the rear end device <b>200</b> of the second embodiment depends on that a preheating device <b>231</b> and the temporary storage <b>233</b> are further included between a second condensation device <b>232</b> and the sieve plate tower <b>220</b> of the rear end device <b>201</b> of the first embodiment, and the second condensation device <b>232</b> can be a plate type condenser.
