      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a polyester film containing a polyester resin obtained by recycling PET bottles. More particularly, the present invention relates to a polyester film containing a polyester resin obtained by recycling PET bottles and having low thermal shrinkage rate, high lamination strength, and slight unevenness in thickness.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Conventionally, there has been known a technique for obtaining a polyester film for wrap-around labels that cause few troubles due to static electricity from a polyester with a low oligomer content without deteriorating the productivity and quality, by using a polyester resin obtained by recycling PET bottles (for example, see Patent Document 1). However, such a conventional technique is used for producing a film with low intrinsic viscosity (1V=0.62) using a raw material resin with high intrinsic viscosity (1V=0.70) by extrusion at a low extrusion temperature (280Â° C.), so that the composition of the inside of the film is uneven, which causes uneven lamination surface and unevenness in thickness. Further, in this technique, a film after biaxial stretching is subjected to a heat treatment at a high temperature in order to obtain high lamination strength. However, since the film is cooled to room temperature abruptly, there occur problems that relaxation of the film is nonuniform in the plane and that the unevenness in thickness is caused.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Further, there has been known a technique for controlling orientation of a film to provide a polyester film for transparent deposition suitable for adhesion of a deposited film to the polyester film and for boiling and retort treatment (for example, see Patent Document 2). However, such a conventional technique is an example of poly(ethylene terephthalate) that does not use a polyester resin obtained by recycling PET bottles, and in the case where a film is produced by using a resin same as the recycled resin and having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.63, the composition of the inside of the film is uneven, so that it results in generation of unevenness in a lamination surface or unevenness in thickness. Further, in this technique, a film after biaxial stretching is subjected to a heat treatment at a high temperature in order to obtain high lamination strength. However, since the film is cooled to room temperature abruptly, there occur problems that relaxation of the film is nonuniform in the plane and that the unevenness in thickness is caused.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Furthermore, there has been known a technique for making slitting property and cutting property in the calendering process good in a magnetic recording medium by controlling particles in a film and film production conditions (for example, see Patent Document 3). However, such a conventional technique is an example of poly(ethylene terephthalate) that does not use a polyester resin obtained by recycling PET bottles, and in the case where a film is produced by using a resin same as the recycled resin and having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.62, the composition of the inside of the film is uneven, so that it results in generation of unevenness in a lamination surface or unevenness in thickness. Further, in this technique, a film after biaxial stretching is subjected to a heat treatment at a high temperature in order to obtain high lamination strength. However, since the film is cooled to room temperature abruptly, there occur problems that relaxation of the film is nonuniform in the plane and that the unevenness in thickness is caused.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Still further, there has been known a technique for improving the heat dimensional stability at the time of producing a ceramic sheet to be used for a release sheet whose heat shrinkage is optimized by optimizing the lengthwise and transverse stretching condition and the heat treatment condition of the film (for example, see Patent Document 4). However, such a conventional technique is an example of poly(ethylene terephthalate) that does not use a polyester resin obtained by recycling PET bottles, and in the case where a film is produced by using a resin same as the recycled resin and having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.62, the composition of the inside of the film is uneven, so that it results in generation of unevenness in a lamination surface or unevenness in thickness. Moreover, there has been disclosed a technical idea of carrying out a heat treatment at a high temperature for a film after biaxial stretching and optionally carrying out cooling after the heat treatment to obtain high lamination strength. However, in the case of a film containing 0.5 mol % or more and 5 mol % or less of isophthalic acid, if this technique is employed as it is, relaxation of the film is nonuniform in the plane and the unevenness in thickness is caused. It is further disclosed that the refractive index (Nz) in the thickness direction is controlled to keep flatness of a film, but in this document, a case where poly(ethylene terephthalate) accounts for 100% and Nz is 1.493 or less is assumed. A film containing 0.5 mol % or more and 5 mol % or less of isophthalic acid is advantageous in that it easily provides sufficient lamination strength as compared with a poly(ethylene terephthalate) film containing 0 mol % of isophthalic acid, but its Nz is too high to improve lamination strength and reduce unevenness in thickness simultaneously. Accordingly, this technique cannot be employed as it is.</p>

      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0016">A biaxial stretching method is not particularly limited, and a tubular method and a simultaneous biaxial stretching method may be employed. A successive biaxial stretching method is preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0017">The lower limit of the intrinsic viscosity of the resin composing a film measured by measuring the film is preferably 0.64 dl/g, more preferably 0.65 dl/g. If the intrinsic viscosity is less than 0.64 dl/g, at the time of producing a film using a recycled resin derived from PET bottles, a decrease in the viscosity may sometimes result in an undesirable defect of uneven thickness since many of the recycled resins derived from PET bottles have an intrinsic viscosity exceeding 0.70. Further, coloration of the film may occur, and therefore, it is not preferable. The upper limit of the intrinsic viscosity is preferably 0.80 dl/g, more preferably 0.70 dl/g. If it exceeds 0.80 dl/g, the resin is difficult to be discharged out of an extruder and the productivity may be deteriorated, and therefore, it is not preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0018">The lower limit of the thickness is preferably 8 Î¼m, more preferably 10 Î¼m, and still more preferably 12 Î¼m. If the film is thinner than 8 Î¼m, the strength as a film may be insufficient, and therefore, it is not preferable. The upper limit of the thickness is preferably 200 Î¼m, more preferably 50 Î¼m, and still more preferably 30 Î¼m. If it exceeds 200 Î¼m, the film is so thick that processing may become difficult.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0019">The lower limit of the thermal shrinkage rate in the lengthwise direction (sometimes referred to as MD) and in the transverse direction (sometimes referred to as TD) is preferably 0.1%, more preferably 0.3%. If it is less than 0.1%, the effect of improvement is saturated, and besides, the film sometimes becomes mechanically fragile, and therefore, it is not preferable. The upper limit of the thermal shrinkage rate is preferably 1.5%, more preferably 1.2%. If it exceeds 1.5%, pitch deviation may be caused due to the dimensional change at the time of processing such as printing, and therefore, it is not preferable. Further, ff it exceeds 1.5%, shrinkage in the width direction may occur due to the dimensional change at the time of processing such as printing, and therefore, it is not preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0020">The lower limit of the refractive index in the thickness direction is preferably 1.493, more preferably 1.494. If it is less than 1.493, orientation is too high and desired lamination strength may not be obtained. The upper limit of the refractive index is preferably 1.4995, more preferably 1.498. If it exceeds 1.4995, the molecular orientation of the film is insufficient and mechanical characteristics may be insufficient, and therefore, it is not preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0021">The unevenness in thickness calculated according to the following equation in the case where the thickness Tn (n=1 to 200) (unit: Î¼m) of a film of 1 m in length and 1 m in width is measured at every 5 mm and at 200 points, and the maximum thickness is defined as Tmax, the minimum thickness is defined as Tmin, and the average thickness is defined as Tave is preferably 16% or less, more preferably 12% or less, and still more preferably 10% or less in both the lengthwise and transverse directions. If it exceeds 16%, winding deviation may occur at the time of winding the film in a film roll, or the appearance of the release surface may become poor when a laminated part is separated and the product value may be deteriorated, and therefore, it is not so preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]Unevenness in thickness={(<i>T</i>maxâ<i>T</i>min)/<i>T</i>ave}Ã100(%)[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0022">The lower limit of the lamination strength is preferably 4.0 N/15 mm, more preferably 4.5 N/15 mm, and still more preferably 5 N/15 mm. If it is less than 4.0 N/15 mm, in the case where the film is used for producing a bag, the laminate part tends to be separated easily, and therefore, it is not preferable. The upper limit of the lamination strength is preferably 20 N/15 mm, more preferably 15 N/15 mm, and still more preferably 10 N/15 mm. If it exceeds 20 N/15 mm, the film may be substantially broken at the time of peeling, and therefore, it is not so preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0023">The appearance evaluation after the lamination is carried out by visually observing a sample after laminate separation. The evaluation is performed as follows. The â level means that there are no micro voids of the adhesive in the surface after separation: the Îlevel means that there are micro voids in 10% or less of the total separated surface area: and the x level means that there are micro voids in more than 10% of the total separated surface area. The Îlevel is preferable, and the â level is more preferable. The x level is not preferable since the appearance is poor after separation of the laminate part and the product value is deteriorated. In the case where the lamination strength is less than 4 N/15 mm, since the basic characteristics of the present invention are not satisfied, the film is not preferable even if it is on the â level.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0024">It is preferable to use, as a raw material, a recycled polyester resin derived from PET bottles containing an isophthalic acid component as an acid component. The crystallinity of a polyester used for PET bottles is controlled to improve the bottle appearance, and as a result, a polyester containing 10 mol % or less of an isophthalic acid component is used in some cases. To utilize a recycled resin, a material containing an isophthalic acid component is used in some cases.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0025">The lower limit of the amount of a terephthalic acid component in all dicarboxylic acid components composing the polyester resin contained in the film is preferably 95 mol %, more preferably 96 mol %, still more preferably 96.5 mol %, and particularly preferably 97 mol %. If it is less than 95 mol %, crystallinity is deteriorated, so that the thermal shrinkage rate may increase, and it is not so preferable. The lower limit of the amount of the terephthalic acid component in the polyester resin contained in the film is preferably 99.5 mol %, more preferably 99 mol %. Since many of the recycled polyester resins derived from PET bottles contain dicarboxylic acid components typified by isophthalic acid besides terephthalic acid, an amount of the terephthalic acid component composing the polyester resin in the film exceeding 99.5 mol % consequently makes it difficult to produce a polyester film containing a recycled resin at a high rate, and therefore, it is not so preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0026">The lower limit of the amount of the isophthalic acid component in all the dicarboxylic acid components composing the polyester resin contained in the film is preferably 0.5 mol %, more preferably 0.7 mol %, still more preferably 0.9 mol %, and particularly preferably 1 mol %. Since many of recycled polyester resins derived from PET bottles contain an isophthalic acid component, an amount of the isophthalic acid component composing the polyester resin in the film of less than 0.5 mol % consequently makes it difficult to produce a polyester film containing a recycled resin at a high rate, and therefore, it is not so preferable. The upper limit of the amount of the isophthalic acid component in all the dicarboxylic acid components composing the polyester resin contained in the film is preferably 5 mol %, more preferably 4 mol %, still more preferably 3.5 mol %, and particularly preferably 3 mol %. If it exceeds 5 mol %, crystallinity is deteriorated, so that the thermal shrinkage rate may increase, and it is not so preferable. Adjustment of the content of the isophthalic acid component to be within the above-mentioned range makes production of a film excellent in lamination strength and shrinkage rate, and reduced in unevenness in thickness easy, and therefore, it is preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0027">The upper limit of the intrinsic viscosity of the recycled resin derived from PET bottles is preferably 0.9 dl/g, more preferably 0.8 dl/g, still more preferably 0.77 dl/g, and particularly preferably 0.75 dl/g. If it exceeds 0.9 dl/g, the resin may become difficult to be discharged out of an extruder and the productivity may be deteriorated, and therefore, it is not so preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0028">The lower limit of the content of the polyester resin obtained by recycling PET bottles relative to the film is preferably 50 wt. %, more preferably 65 wt. %, and still more preferably 75 wt. %. If it is less than 50 wt. %, the content is too low for utilization of the recycled resin, and it is not so preferable in terms of contribution to environmental preservation. The upper limit of the content of the polyester resin obtained by recycling PET bottles is preferably 95 wt. %, more preferably 90 wt. %, and still more preferably 85 wt. %. If it exceeds 95 wt. %, it is sometimes impossible to sufficiently add a lubricant or an additive such as inorganic particles for improving the function as a film, and therefore, it is not so preferable. Additionally, a polyester resin obtained by recycling PET bottles may be used as a master batch (a resin to be contained in a high concentration) to be used in the case where a lubricant or an additive such as inorganic particles is added for improving the function as a film.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0029">As the kind of the lubricant, inorganic lubricants such as silica, calcium carbonate, and alumina, and also organic lubricants are preferable, and silica and calcium carbonate are more preferable. These lubricants provide transparency and slippage.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0030">The lower limit of the lubricant content in the film is preferably 0.01 wt. %, more preferably 0.015 wt. %, and still more preferably 0.02 wt. %. If it is less than 0.01 wt. %, the slippage may be deteriorated. The upper limit of the lubricant content is preferably 1 wt. %, more preferably 0.2 wt. %, and still more preferably 0.1 wt. %. If it exceeds 1 wt. %, transparency may be deteriorated, and it is not so preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0031">A method for producing the film of the present invention is not particularly limited, but the following production method is recommended. It is important to set a temperature suitable for melting and extruding a resin in an extruder. The basic idea is that (1) deterioration is suppressed by extrusion at a temperature as low as possible, since a polyester resin used for PET bottles contains an isophthalic acid component, and (2) a part for melting at a high temperature and high pressure is kept to sufficiently and evenly melt highly crystalline micro parts with high intrinsic viscosity. Addition of the isophthalic acid component leads to deterioration of the tacticity of a polyester and a decrease in the melting point. Therefore, extrusion at a high temperature results in a significant decrease in melt viscosity or deterioration by heat, and also in a decrease in the mechanical strength and an increase in foreign matters resulting from the deterioration. Further, sufficient melt-kneading is impossible merely by lowering the extrusion temperature, and it may result in problems of an increase in unevenness in thickness and foreign matters such as fish eyes. Accordingly, a recommended production method may be, for example, a method of using two extruders in tandem, a method of increasing the pressure in a filter part, or a method of using a screw with high shear force for part of screw equipment. Hereinafter, an example of controlling the temperature using a single extruder will be described.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows one embodiment of the inside of an extruder in a film production facility in the present invention. In a screw <b>1</b> having a flight <b>2</b> between barrels <b>3</b>, the screw <b>1</b> includes a supply part <b>4</b>, a compaction part <b>5</b>, and a measurement part <b>6</b> from the base to the tip end thereof. The compaction part <b>5</b> is a region where the distance between the screw <b>1</b> and the barrels <b>3</b> is gradually narrowed. In the present invention, the extruder is preferably contrived to sufficiently carry out melt-kneading in the compaction part <b>5</b> in which the shear force is high, and to avoid thermal deterioration in the supply part <b>4</b> and the measurement part <b>6</b>, by setting the temperature in the supply part <b>4</b> and the measurement part <b>6</b> as low as possible and setting the temperature in the compaction part <b>5</b> high.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0033">The lower limit of the set temperature in the resin melting part (excluding the highest set temperature in the compaction part of the screw in the extruder) in the extruder is preferably 270Â° C., and the upper limit thereof is preferably 290Â° C. If it is less than 270Â° C., extrusion becomes difficult, and if it exceeds 290Â° C., the resin may be deteriorated, and therefore, it is not so preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0034">The lower limit of the highest set temperature in the compaction part of the screw in the extruder is preferably 295Â° C. In a polyester resin used for PET bottles, crystals with high melting points (260Â° C. to 290Â° C.) often exist in terms of transparency. Further, an additive, a crystallization nucleating agent, and the like are added, and unevenness in the fine melting behavior is observed in the resin material. If the highest set temperature is less than 295Â° C., it becomes difficult to sufficiently melt them, and therefore, it is not so preferable. The upper limit of the highest set temperature in the compaction part of the screw in the extruder is preferably 310Â° C. If it exceeds 310Â° C., the resin may be deteriorated, and therefore, it is not so preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0035">The lower limit of the time for the resin to pass the region at the highest set temperature in the compaction part of the screw in the extruder is preferably 10 sec., more preferably 15 sec. If it is shorter than 10 sec., the polyester resin used for PET bottles cannot be melted sufficiently, and therefore, it is not so preferable. The upper limit of the time is preferably 60 sec., more preferably 50 sec. If it exceeds 60 sec., the resin may be easily deteriorated, and therefore, it is not so preferable. It is made possible to obtain a film reduced in unevenness in thickness, foreign matters such as fish eyes, and coloration by setting an extruder in such ranges even if a large quantity of a polyester resin obtained by recycling PET bottles is used.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0036">A resin melted in the above-mentioned manner is extruded in a sheet-like form on a cooling roll, and thereafter biaxially stretched. The stretching method may be a simultaneous biaxial stretching method, but a successive biaxial stretching method is preferable. In the above-mentioned manner, it is made easy to satisfy both productivity and the quality required in the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0037">A method for stretching the film in the present invention is not particularly limited, but the following points are important. To stretch a resin having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.64 dl/g or more and containing an isophthalic acid component, the stretch ratios and temperatures in the lengthwise direction (MD) stretching and transverse direction (TD) stretching are important. If the MD stretch ratio and temperature are improper, stretching force is not evenly applied, and the orientation of molecules is insufficient, which may result in an increase in unevenness in thickness or insufficiency of mechanical characteristics. Further, the film may be torn in the next TD stretching step, or unevenness in thickness may be increased extremely. If the TD stretch ratio and temperature are improper, stretching is not carried out evenly, balance of the lengthwise and transverse orientation is deteriorated, and the mechanical characteristics may be insufficient. Further, in the case where the next heat fixation step is performed in the state that the unevenness in thickness is significant or the molecular chain orientation is insufficient, relaxation cannot be carried out evenly, and problems of more significant unevenness in thickness and insufficient mechanical characteristics may be caused. Accordingly, basically, it is recommended to carry out the stretching step by step in the MD stretching after carrying out the temperature adjustment as follows, and carry out the stretching in the TD stretching at a proper temperature so that the orientation balance is not extremely deteriorated. Hereinafter, one embodiment will be described, but the description is not to be construed as limiting the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0038">A method for stretching the film in the lengthwise direction (MD) is preferably a roll stretching method or an IR heating method.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0039">The lower limit of the MD stretching temperature is preferably 100Â° C., more preferably 110Â° C., and still more preferably 120Â° C. If it is less than 100Â° C., even if a polyester resin with an intrinsic viscosity of 0.64 dl/g or more is stretched to orient molecules in the lengthwise direction, the film may be torn in the next transverse stretching step or an extreme thickness defect may be caused, and therefore, it is not preferable. The upper limit of the MD stretching temperature is preferably 140Â° C., more preferably 135Â° C., and still more preferably 130Â° C. If it exceeds 140Â° C., orientation of molecular chains may become insufficient and mechanical characteristics may become insufficient, and therefore, it is not so preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0040">The lower limit of the MD stretch ratio is preferably 2.5 times, more preferably 3.5 times, and still more preferably 4 times. If it is less than 2.5 times, even if a polyester resin with an intrinsic viscosity of 0.64 dl/g or more is stretched to orient molecules in the lengthwise direction, the film may be torn in the next transverse stretching step or an extreme thickness defect may be caused, and therefore, it is not so preferable. The upper limit of the MD stretch ratio is preferably 5 times, more preferably 4.8 times, and still more preferably 4.5 times. If it exceeds 5 times, the effect of improving mechanical strength and unevenness in thickness may be saturated, and it is not so meaningful.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0041">An MD stretching method may be the above-mentioned one-stage stretching, but the film is preferably stretched in two or more stages. Stretching in two or more stages makes it possible to well stretch a polyester resin with high intrinsic viscosity derived from a recycled resin containing isophthalic acid, and to reduce the unevenness in thickness and improve lamination strength and mechanical characteristics.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0042">The lower limit of the MD stretching temperature in the first stage is preferably 110Â° C., more preferably 115Â° C. If it is less than 110Â° C., heat is insufficient, so that vertical stretching cannot be carried out sufficiently and the film becomes poor in the flatness, and therefore, it is not preferable. The upper limit of the MD stretching temperature in the first stage is preferably 125Â° C., more preferably 120Â° C. If it exceeds 125Â° C., orientation of molecular chains may become insufficient and mechanical characteristics may be deteriorated, and therefore, it is not so preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0043">The lower limit of the MD stretch ratio in the first stage is preferably 1.1 times, more preferably 1.3 times. If it is 1.1 times or more, a polyester resin with an intrinsic viscosity of 0.64 dl/g or more can be finally stretched in the lengthwise direction sufficiently by carrying weak stretching in the first stage, and accordingly, the productivity can be improved. The upper limit of the MD stretch ratio in the first stage is preferably 2 times, more preferably 1.6 times. If it exceeds 2 times, since the orientation of molecular chains in the lengthwise direction is so high that the stretching may become difficult in the second stage or thereafter and the film may have large unevenness in thickness, and therefore, it is not preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0044">The lower limit of the MD stretching temperature in the second stage (or final stage) is preferably 110Â° C., more preferably 115Â° C. If it is 110Â° C. or more, a polyester resin with an intrinsic viscosity of 0.64 or more can be sufficiently stretched in the lengthwise direction and can be stretched in the transverse direction in the next step, so that the unevenness in thickness in the lengthwise and transverse directions may be reduced. The upper limit of the MD stretching temperature is preferably 130Â° C., more preferably 125Â° C. If it exceeds 130Â° C., crystallization is promoted, so that the transverse stretching may become difficult or the unevenness in thickness may become significant, and therefore, it is not so preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0045">The lower limit of the MD stretch ratio in the second stage (or final stage) is preferably 2.1 times, more preferably 2.5 times. If it is less than 2.1 times, even if a polyester resin with an intrinsic viscosity of 0.64 or more is stretched to orient molecules in the lengthwise direction, the film may be torn in the next transverse stretching step or an extreme thickness defect may be caused, and therefore, it is not so preferable. The upper limit of the MD stretch ratio is preferably 3.5 times, more preferably 3.1 times. If it exceeds 3.5 times, since the orientation in the lengthwise direction is so high that the stretching may be impossible in the second stage or thereafter and the film may have significant unevenness in thickness, and therefore, it is not so preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0046">The lower limit of the TD stretching temperature is preferably 110Â° C., more preferably 120Â° C., and still more preferably 125Â° C. If it is less than 110Â° C., the stretching stress in the transverse direction is increased, so that the film may be torn or the unevenness in thickness may become extremely large, and therefore, it is not so preferable. The upper limit of the TD stretching temperature is preferably 150Â° C., more preferably 145Â° C., and still more preferably 140Â° C. If it exceeds 150Â° C., orientation of molecular chains does not increase, so that mechanical characteristics may be deteriorated, and therefore, it is not so preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0047">The lower limit of the transverse direction (TD) stretch ratio is preferably 3.5 times, more preferably 3.9 times. If it less than 3.5 times, molecular orientation is weak and mechanical strength may become insufficient, and therefore, it is not so preferable. Further, the orientation of molecular chains in the lengthwise direction is significant and the balance between the lengthwise and transverse directions is deteriorated to make the unevenness in thickness large, and therefore, it is not so preferable. The upper limit of the TD stretch ratio is preferably 5.5 times, more preferably 4.5 times. If it exceeds 5.5 times, the film may be torn, and it is not so preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0048">To obtain the film of the present invention, it is desirable to properly set the conditions for heat fixation carried out in a tenter after the completion of the TD stretching and for the subsequent cooling of the film to room temperature. As compared with a common poly(ethylene terephthalate) film containing no isophthalic acid, a polyester film containing a recycled resin derived from PET bottles and containing isophthalic acid has low crystallinity, tends to be melted in an ultra-fine level, and is poor in mechanical strength. Because of that, in the case where the polyester film is exposed to high temperatures under strain abruptly after completion of stretching, or in the case where the polyester film is abruptly cooled under strain after completion of heat fixation, the tensile force balance in the width direction is disordered due to inevitable temperature difference in the film width direction, and it results in unevenness in thickness and defective mechanical characteristics. On the other hand, when the heat fixation temperature is lowered to deal with the phenomenon, it is sometimes impossible to obtain sufficient lamination strength. In the present invention, it is recommended to carry out steps of heat fixation 1 at a rather lower temperature, heat fixation 2 (if necessary, heat fixation 3) at a sufficiently high temperature, and thereafter, gradual cooling to lower the temperature to room temperature after the stretching. However, the present invention is not limited to this method, and other recommended methods include a method of controlling the film tension correspondingly to the velocity of hot air in the tenter and the temperatures in the respective zones; a method of carrying out heat treatment at a relatively low temperature in a furnace with a sufficient length after completion of the stretching; and a method of relaxing the film by heat rolls after completion of the heat fixation.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0049">As one example, a method by controlling the tenter temperature will be described.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0050">The lower limit of the temperature in the heat fixation 1 is preferably 160Â° C., more preferably 170Â° C. If it is less than 160Â° C., the thermal shrinkage rate becomes significant finally and deviation and shrinkage may be caused at the time of processing, and therefore, it is not so preferable. The upper limit of the temperature in the heat fixation 1 is preferably 215Â° C., more preferably 210Â° C. If it exceeds 215Â° C., the film is abruptly exposed to a high temperature, so that the unevenness in thickness becomes significant or the film may be torn, and therefore, it is not so preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0051">The lower limit of the time for the heat fixation 1 is preferably 0.5 sec., more preferably 2 sec. If it is shorter than 0.5 sec, the film temperature increase may be insufficient. The upper limit of the time for the heat fixation 1 is preferably 10 sec., more preferably 8 sec. If it exceeds 10 sec., productivity may be deteriorated, and it is not so preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0052">The lower limit of the temperature in the heat fixation 2 is preferably 220Â° C., more preferably 227Â° C. If it is less than 220Â° C., the thermal shrinkage rate becomes significant, and deviation and shrinkage may be caused at the time of processing, and therefore, it is not so preferable. The upper limit of the temperature in the heat fixation 2 is preferably 240Â° C., more preferably 237Â° C.

The resin was named as a polyester A.</p>

      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0084">On the other hand, in the case of Comparative Example 1, since there was no TS1 and no cooling step, the unevenness in thickness was significant because of shrinkage or the like due to abrupt temperature change. In the case of Comparative Example 2, since the temperature in the compaction part of the screw was low, the resin was melted insufficiently and the unevenness in thickness was significant. In the case of Comparative Example 3, since the content of the isophthalic acid component was high and the crystallinity was low, the resin was soft and the applied force was insufficient in the stretching, and thus the unevenness in thickness was significant. Comparative Example 4 was an experiment replicating the contents described in Patent Document 1, and since the TS3 temperature was low, the refractive index in the thickness direction was low and the lamination strength was insufficient. Comparative Example 5 was an experiment replicating the contents described in Patent Document 2, and since the TD stretching temperature was low and there was no cooling step after the heat fixation, the unevenness in thickness was significant due to abrupt cooling. Comparative Example 6 was an experiment replicating the contents described in Patent Document 3, and the MD stretching was carried out in three stages. In Comparative Example 6, the extrusion temperature was as high as 310Â° C., and therefore, the intrinsic viscosity of the film became low, relaxation in the heat fixation was insufficient, and the thermal shrinkage rate was high. Comparative Example 7 was an experiment replicating the contents described in Patent Document 4, and since there was no cooling step after the heat fixation, the unevenness in thickness was significant due to abrupt cooling. In Comparative Example 8, since no recycled raw materials derived from PET bottles were used, gradual cooling was performed by lowering the TS3 temperature to make the unevenness in thickness slight. However, due to an insufficient temperature for TS3, the refractive index in the thickness direction was low, and the lamination strength was insufficient.</p>
