      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Field of the Disclosure</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a process for reducing the concentration of R<sub>f</sub>Câ¡CX impurities in fluoroolefins by contact with a zeolite.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Many industries have been working for the past few decades to find replacements for the ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). The CFCs and HCFCs have been employed in a wide range of applications, including their use as aerosol propellants, refrigerants, cleaning agents, expansion agents for thermoplastic and thermoset foams, heat transfer media, gaseous dielectrics, fire extinguishing and suppression agents, power cycle working fluids, polymerization media, particulate removal fluids, carrier fluids, buffing abrasive agents, and displacement drying agents. In the search for replacements for these versatile compounds, many industries have turned to the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The HFCs do not contribute to the destruction of stratospheric ozone, but are of concern due to their contribution to the âgreenhouse effectâ, i.e., they contribute to global warming. As a result of their contribution to global warming, the HFCs have come under scrutiny, and their widespread use may also be limited in the future. Thus, there is a need for chemical compounds that have both low ozone depleting potentials (ODPs) and low global warming potentials (GWPs).</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The present disclosure provides a process comprising: contacting a mixture comprising at least one fluoroolefin and at least one R<sub>f</sub>Câ¡CX impurity with at least one zeolite to reduce the concentration of said at least one R<sub>f</sub>Câ¡CX impurity in said mixture; wherein: (a) R<sub>f </sub>is a straight-chain perfluorinated alkyl group, and X is H, F, Cl, Br or I; and (b) said at least one zeolite is selected from the group consisting of zeolites having pore opening of at least 4 Angstroms and no more than about 5 Angstroms, zeolites having pore opening of at least about 5 Angstroms and Sanderson electronegativity of no more than about 2.6, and mixtures thereof; provided that said at least one zeolite is not zeolite 4A.

      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Fluoroolefins have been found to have low ODPs and low GWPs and have been regarded as potential replacements for HFCs in many applications. For example, CF<sub>3</sub>CFâCH<sub>2 </sub>(HFO-1234yf) and CF<sub>3</sub>CHâCHF (HFO-1234ze), having zero ODPs and low GWPs, have been identified as potential refrigerants. For another example, CF<sub>3</sub>CHâCHCl (HCFO-1233zd) and CF<sub>3</sub>CClâCH<sub>2 </sub>(HCFO-1233xf), having low ODPs and low GWPs, may be used as foam expansion agents.

The term âpyrolyzingâ or âpyrolysisâ, as used herein, means chemical change produced by heating in the absence of catalyst. By absence of catalyst is meant that no material or treatment is added to the pyrolysis reactor that increases the reaction rate by reducing the activation energy of the pyrolysis process.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">Suitable reactors for pyrolysis may be of any shape consistent with the process. In some embodiments of this invention, the reactor is a cylindrical tube, either straight or coiled. Heat is applied to the outside of the tube, with the chemical reaction taking place on the inside of the tube. Of note are pyrolysis reactors wherein the flow of gases through the reactor is partially obstructed to cause back-mixing, i.e. turbulence, and thereby promote mixing of gases and good heat transfer. This partial obstruction can be conveniently obtained by placing packing within the interior of the reactor, filling its cross-section or by using perforated baffles. The reactor packing can be particulate or fibrillar, has an open structure like that of Raschig Rings or other packings with a high free volume to avoid the accumulation of coke and to minimize pressure drop, and permits a generally free flow of gas. In some embodiments of this invention, the reactor packing is in cartridge disposition for ease of insertion and removal. In some embodiments of this invention, the pyrolysis reactor is substantially empty which means that the free volume of the reaction zone is at least about 80%, and in another embodiment, at least about 90%, and in another embodiment at least about 95%. The free volume is the volume of the reaction zone minus the volume of the material that makes up the reactor packing, and the % free volume is the ratio of the free volume relative to the total volume of the reactor times 100.</p>

Typical materials of construction include stainless steels, in particular of the austenitic type, the well-known high nickel alloys, such as Monelâ¢ nickel-copper alloys, Hastelloyâ¢ nickel-based alloys and, Inconelâ¢ nickel-chromium alloys, and copper-clad steel.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Suitable Zeolites of this Disclosure:</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">Zeolites used in the processes of this invention are crystalline, highly porous materials. They can be generically described as complex aluminosilicates characterized by a three-dimensional pore system. The zeolite framework structure has corner-linked tetrahedra with Al or Si atoms at centers of the tetrahedra and oxygen atoms at the corners. In order to be a zeolite, the ratio (Si+Al)/O must equal Â½. Such tetrahedra are combined in a well-defined repeating structure comprising various combinations of 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-membered rings. The resulting framework structure is one of regular channels and/or cages, which has a pore network that is useful for separation or purification purposes. The size of pore opening is critical to the performance of zeolite in separation or purification applications, since this characteristic determines whether molecules of certain size can enter and exit the zeolite pore system.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">The size of the pore opening that controls access to the interior of the zeolites is determined not only by the geometric dimensions of the tetrahedra forming the pore opening, but also by the presence or absence of ions in or near the pore. For example, in the case of zeolite A, access can be restricted by monovalent ions, such as Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup>, which are situated in or near 8-member ring openings as well as 6-member ring openings. Access can be enhanced by divalent ions, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which are situated only in or near 6-member ring openings. Thus, the potassium and sodium salts of zeolite A exhibit pore openings of about 3 Angstroms and about 4 Angstroms respectively, whereas the calcium salt of zeolite A has a pore opening of about 5 Angstroms.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">The Sanderson electronegativity model (see R. T. Sanderson, âChemical Bonds and Bond Energyâ, 2<sup>nd </sup>ed., Academic Press, New York, 1976 (i.e., Sanderson 1976 model); R. T. Sanderson, âElectronegativity and Bond Energyâ, J. <i>Amer. Chem. Soc. </i>1983, 105, 2259-2261 (i.e., Sanderson 1983 model); W. J. Mortier, âZeolite Electronegativity Related to Physicochemical Propertiesâ, <i>J. Catal. </i>1978, 83, 138-145) furnishes a useful method for classifying zeolites based on their chemical composition. In accordance with this invention the preferential sorption of R<sub>f</sub>Câ¡CX impurity by zeolites can be correlated with their intermediate electronegativity (i.e., their S<sub>int</sub>, the geometric mean of the electronegativities) as determined by the Sanderson method based upon chemical composition. According to Barthomeuf (D. Barthomeuf, âAcidity and Basicity in Zeolitesâ, In Catalysis and Adsorption in Zeolites, G. Ohlmann et al., eds., Elsevier (1991), pages 157-169), an apparent S<sub>int </sub>break point between acidity and basicity is at about 3.5 (based on Sanderson 1976 model) or about 2.6 (based on Sanderson 1983 model). In other words, generally, zeolites with S<sub>int </sub>of no more than about 2.6 (based on Sanderson 1983 model) tend to exhibit base properties, while those with S<sub>int </sub>greater than about 2.6 are acidic. The term âSanderson electronegativityâ, as used herein, refers to the S<sub>int </sub>value based on Sanderson 1983 model.</p>

      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0124">When neutral, i.e., zero valent, metals, metal alloys and their mixtures are used. Useful metals include, but are not limited to, Pd, Pt, Rh, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Cr, Mn, and combinations of the foregoing as alloys or mixtures. The catalyst may be supported or unsupported. Useful examples of metal alloys include, but are not limited to, SS 316, Monet 400, Incoloy 825, Alloy 20, Hastelloy, Inconel 600, and Inconel 625.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0125">In an aspect of the present invention, in this step, catalysts include activated carbon, stainless steel (e.g., SS 316), austenitic nickel-based alloys (e.g., Inconel 625), nickel, and in certain embodiments fluorinated 10% CsCl/MgO. A suitable reaction temperature is about 300-550Â° C. and a suitable reaction pressure may be between about 0-150 psig. The reactor effluent may be fed to a caustic scrubber or to a distillation column to remove the byproduct of HCl to produce an acid-free organic product which, optionally, may undergo further purification using one or any combination of purification techniques that are known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0126">The reaction may be carried out at a temperature range of from about 200Â° C. to about 800Â° C., from about 300Â° C. to about 600Â° C., or from about 400Â° C. to about 500Â° C. Suitable reactor pressures range from about 0 psig to about 200 psig, from about 10 psig to about 100 psig, or from about 20 to about 70 psig.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0127">In general, the effluent from the dehydrochlorination reactor may be processed to achieve desired degrees of separation and/or other processing. Besides HFO-1234yf produced, the effluent generally contains HCl, unconverted HCFC-244bb, and HCFO-1233xf (which is mainly carried over from the previous step of HCFO-1233xf hydrofluorination). Optionally, HCl is then recovered from the result of the dehydrochlorination reaction. Recovery of HCl is conducted by conventional distillation where it is removed from the distillate. Alternatively, HCl can be recovered or removed by using water or caustic scrubbers. When a water extractor is used, HCl is removed as an aqueous solution. When a caustic solution is used, HCl is removed from system as a chloride salt in aqueous solution. After the recovery or removal of HCl, the organic stream may be sent to a distillation column for separation. HFO-1234yf, collected from the overhead of the column, may be sent to another column for further purification, while a fraction of the mixture of HCFO-1233xf and HCFC-244bb, accumulated in the reboiler, may be sent back to the dehydrochlorination reactor for the recycle of HCFC-244bb, and the rest to the HCFO-1233xf hydrofluorination reactor for the recycle of HCFO-1233xf.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0128">The HFO-1234 so produced is then contacted with the molecular sieves, in accordance with the present invention, to remove the CF<sub>3</sub>Câ¡CH impurity. In an embodiment, before the removal of the CF<sub>3</sub>Câ¡CH impurity from the HFO-1234, the concentration of the CF<sub>3</sub>Câ¡CH impurity present may be measured using techniques known in the art, such as gas chromatography.</p>
