      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a latent fingerprint detection method, a heating evaporation device for detecting a latent fingerprint, a latent fingerprint detection apparatus, and a composition for detecting a latent fingerprint.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">A latent fingerprint is one in which the shape of raised portions of skin (fingerprint ridges) with secretion attached thereto at a fingertip or the like are transferred to a specimen, such as a piece of evidence. The latent fingerprint contains, besides moisture that is the main ingredient, salt such as sodium chloride, lactic acid, amino acids, uric acid, protein, and vitamins. A latent fingerprint detection becomes an evidential matter necessary for determining, arresting, and prosecuting a criminal, thus being an important means for criminal investigation.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Conventional methods for detecting a latent fingerprint employ chemical reaction and physical adsorption reaction with fingerprint ingredients. Specifically, there are a powder method in which fine powder of aluminum, lycopodium, or the like is attached to moisture or fat in the fingerprint ingredients so as to use a color tone difference between the specimen and the powder, and a liquid method in which amino acid and salt contained in the fingerprint ingredients are reacted with chemicals so as to cause coloration.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">With the powder method, the surface of the specimen to which a fingerprint is attached or the fingerprint seems to be attached is lightly brushed with a brush dusted with aluminum powder so that the aluminum powder is attached to the fingerprint, and the fingerprint is transferred to a gelatin sheet. However, in the process of applying the fine powder of aluminum or the like to the entirety of a region including the latent fingerprint, other fingerprint or the like may be mixed and contaminated, thus being obstructive to the case of conducting a DNA test after detecting the fingerprint. In the criminal investigation, if the specimen is a specific material, for example, a metal murder weapon such as pistol and knife, a synthetic leather, and an adhesive surface of a tape, it may be difficult to transfer a clear fingerprint.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">With the liquid method, a specimen with a latent fingerprint needs to be immersed in a chemical solution, and hence it is unsuitable for detecting a fingerprint at a location that cannot be moved, such as walls. There are also the problems that the latent fingerprint may be washed away with the chemical solution, and that the specimen including the latent fingerprint may also be stained. It is therefore desired to achieve a technology of surely detecting the fingerprint without directly contacting the specimen.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">As a detection method in place of the powder method or the liquid method, there is, for example, a fingerprint detection method (cyanoacrylate method) using 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester (monomer), which is one of gas methods suitable for a weak latent fingerprint and a specimen that is apt to change with a solvent or the like. The cyanoacrylate method has already been put to practical use in Japan and overseas. The cyanoacrylate method is intended for actualizing the latent fingerprint by polymerizing the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester on the latent fingerprint region so as to form white solidification. The cyanoacrylate method is capable of restoring a clearer fingerprint trace, however, it may be difficult to ensure detection on a whitish specimen, such as a shopping bag and aluminum foil, because 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymerized on the latent fingerprint is transparent or white.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Hence, in order to improve the disadvantage of the cyanoacrylate method, a method has been proposed which includes bringing a fluorescent aye into contact during or after the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester processing.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">For example, with the fingerprint detection method disclosed in Patent Document 1, after the evaporated 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester is brought into contact with the surface of a test object so as to be gradually deposited thereon, a solution in which a fluorescent dye is dissolved in an organic solvent is brought into contact with the specimen, and the solution on the surface of the test object is dried, thereby detecting a fingerprint as a fluorescent fingerprint.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">With the fingerprint detection method disclosed in Patent Document 2, a specimen having a fingerprint detected thereon is exposed to vaporization atmosphere of 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and a sublimation dye, thereby detecting a colored fingerprint image.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">With the polymer for detecting a fingerprint, the method for producing the same, the composition for detecting a fingerprint, and the fingerprint detection method using them, which are disclosed in Patent Document 3, 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester is polymerized using a specific fluorescent dye as a polymerization initiator, thus allowing the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the fluorescent dye to be attached to a latent fingerprint at a low depolymerization temperature in a single step. This ensures a clear fluorescence detection even on the whitish specimen, such as the shopping bag and aluminum foil, which have been difficult to detect so far.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">However, Patent Document 1 requires a two-stage processing in which the gasified 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester is attached to the latent fingerprint, followed by processing with the solution. When a specimen, such as plastic, is used, it is unavoidable that the specimen is altered due to the organic solvent. In addition, the flammability and toxicity of the organic solvent becomes an issue. The fingerprint detection method as disclosed in Patent Document 2 uses both the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye, and hence there is the problem that such a basic dye as to polymerize the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester cannot be used, and the usable dye is limited. From the viewpoints of storage stability and on-site handling properties, it is not preferable to use both the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye. The fingerprint detection method as disclosed in Patent Document 3 has satisfactory handling properties because of the use of 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer. However, the depolymerization of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer requires high temperatures of approximately 170-210Â° C., thus making it difficult to stably gasify and evaporate by a simple device. Additionally, the DNA of a latent fingerprint may be damaged because ultraviolet is used for detection. When a specific wavelength light is used for detecting the fluorescent fingerprint, depending on the specimen, the specimen itself including the latent fingerprint may develop a color, thus making it difficult to achieve the detection.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">As a means for gasifying (vaporizing) the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester, there is employed a method in which the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester is gasified by heating with a heater or the like. The use of flames makes it possible to reach high temperatures in a short time, however, may cause a fire. The use of the heater needs to ensure, for example, a stationary power source, thus contributing to deterioration of detection efficiency.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide a latent fingerprint detection method that is easy to handle and is capable of clearly detecting a latent fingerprint, and a heating evaporation device for detecting a latent fingerprint and a latent fingerprint detection apparatus, by which a chemical agent is heated at high temperatures in a short time so as to detect a clear latent fingerprint by a single operation, as well as a composition for detecting a latent fingerprint.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM</heading>

      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">(4) In the latent fingerprint detection method as described in any one of the above (1) to (3), the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer is obtained by polymerizing alkyl 2-cyanoacrylate having an alkyl group with a carbon number of 1 to 4.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">(5) In the latent fingerprint detection method as described in any one of the above (1) to (4), the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer is polymerized using a water-containing alcohol.</p>

      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">(7) A heating evaporation device for detecting a latent fingerprint is intended to conduct the latent fingerprint detection method described in any one of the above (1) to (6). The heating evaporation device includes a chemical agent to be gasified by heating so as to attach to a latent fingerprint on a specimen, a chemical agent storage part to store the chemical agent therein, and a heat generator that includes the chemical agent storage part to store a hydrolysis exothermic agent therein.

      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">A latent fingerprint detection method according to the present invention includes a heating step of heating a chemical agent to be gasified by heating so as to attach to a latent fingerprint on a specimen, and an exposure step of exposing the specimen having the latent fingerprint attached thereto to an atmosphere of the gasified chemical agent. The chemical agent is a mixture of a 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer and a dye (hereinafter also referred to as âa composition for detecting a latent fingerprint).</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer for use in the present invention is one in which a generally used 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester (monomer) is polymerized onto an adhesive composition or the like. Examples of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester include esters, such as methyl, ethyl, chloroethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, allyl, propargyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl, tetrahydrofurfuryl, heptyl, 2-ethylhexyl, n-octyl, 2-octyl, n-nonyl, oxononyl, n-decyl, n-dodecyl, methoxyethyl, methoxypropyl, methoxyisopropyl, methoxybutyl, ethoxyethyl, ethoxypropyl, ethoxy isopropyl, propoxymethyl, propoxyethyl, isopropoxyethyl, propoxypropyl, butoxymethyl, butoxyethyl, butoxypropyl, butoxyisopropyl, butoxybutyl, <b>2</b>,<b>2</b>,2-trifluoroethyl, and hexafluoroisopropyl. Only one kind or two or more kinds of these 2-cyanoacrylic acid esters may be used together. Of these, alkyl 2-cyanoacrylate is preferred, and alkyl 2-cyanoacrylate having an alkyl group with a carbon number of 1 to 4 is more preferred because of high reactivity with respect to moisture or the like in a latent fingerprint.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer is producible by subjecting 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester as a monomer to polymerization reaction. Although the polymerization of 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester can be conducted using water, alcohol, or a basic compound as a polymerization initiator, water or alcohol is preferred, and water-containing alcohol is more preferred in the present invention. As the alcohol, it is possible to use an optional alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer may have any shape, but a powder-shape is preferred because efficient depolymerization is ensured in the heating step. The powder-shaped 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer is producible by, for example, dissolving in acetone the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer polymerized using the water-containing alcohol, and by reprecipitating with methanol, followed by suction filtration and drying under reduced pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The dye for use in the present invention is preferably a sublimation dye having high thermal stability and a wide excitation region. Particularly, fluorescent pigments, such as anthraquinone-based dyes and naphthalimide-based dyes, are more suitably used because these have excellent absorption properties in a visible light region so as to ensure a clear detection of a latent fingerprint. Specific examples of the anthraquinone-based dyes include amino anthraquinone, amino hydroxy anthraquinone, diamino anthraquinone, dihydroxy anthraquinone, and diaminodihydroxy anthraquinone. Specific examples of the naphthalimide-based dyes include alkyl naphthalimide, alkoxy naphthalimide, alkoxyalkyl naphthalimide, amino naphthalimide, alkylamino naphthalimide, nitro naphthalimide, halogenated naphthalimide, carbonyl naphthalimide, phenylthio naphthalimide, cyano naphthalimide, and hydroxy naphthalimide.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In the present invention, these dyes can be washed with acid before being mired with the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer. This ensures removal of an extremely small amount of impurities, such as a basic compound, attached to the surface of the dye.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The acid to wash the dye is preferably sulfonic acid or halogenated carboxylic acid. Specific examples of the acid include aryl sulfonates, such as benzenesulfonic acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid, alkyl sulfonic acids, such as methanesulfonic acid and ethanesulfonic acid, and halogenated carboxylic acids, such as trichloroacetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid. These acids are used as a dilute solution (0.1-5% by mass concentration), such as water, toluene, methanol, and acetone.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The content of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer in the composition for detecting a latent fingerprint according to the present invention is preferably 10-90% by mass, more preferably 10-70% by mass, and particularly preferably 10-50% by mass. The clear detection of the latent fingerprint is ensured when the content of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer is in the above-mentioned range.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The content of the dye in the composition for detecting a latent fingerprint is not particularly limited as long as the effect of the present invention is not impaired. The content of the dye needs to be 1% by mass or more, preferably 10% by mass or more, more preferably 50% by mass, and particularly preferably 60-90% by mass with respect to a total amount of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer and the dye. When the content of the dye is 50% by mass or more with respect to the total amount of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer and the dye, the clear detection of a fingerprint is ensured even after time has passed after the chemical agent was attached to the latent fingerprint, while ensuring more excellent reducibility of the fingerprint.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In the mixture obtained by mixing the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer and the dye in the present invention, the volatilization temperature of the dye is lowered due to the heating. This seems to be because 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester generated by the depolymerization is vaporized, thereby facilitating volatilization of the dye. Consequently, the volatilization temperature of the entirety of the composition for detecting a latent fingerprint can be set low.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In the present invention, the composition for detecting a latent fingerprint may contain ingredients other than the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer and the dye as long as the effect of the present invention is producible. Examples of the ingredients include stabilizer, plasticizer, and thickener.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The latent fingerprint detection method according to the present invention has the heating step and the exposure step as described earlier.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The heating step is to heat the mixture of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer and the dye so as to generate gases (vapors) of 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye. The 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer is depolymerized by heating, thereby generating the gas of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The heating in the heating step can be carried out by flames, a hotplate device, or a device with a beating part. Particularly, a heating method using a hydrolysis heating agent is preferred because a high-temperature heating can be achieved in a short time without using flames or a power source. The hydrolysis heating agent is a material that generates heat by itself upon reaction with water. Examples of the hydrolysis heating agent include calcium oxide (quicklime), magnesium chloride, aluminum chloride, calcium chloride, and iron chloride.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The exposure step is to bring the specimen into contact with the gases of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye which are to be generated in the heating step. During the exposure step, the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester is polymerized onto a latent fingerprint region on the specimen using, as a polymerization initiator, the moisture that is the main ingredient of the latent fingerprint region, and the dye is selectively adsorbed onto the latent fingerprint, thereby obtaining a fluorescent fingerprint image. In the exposure step, the gases of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye may be directly sprayed to the specimen so as to ensure the contact therebetween. However, the exposure step is preferably conducted in a storage case filled with the gases in order to efficiently bring the gases into contact with the specimen.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The present invention preferably includes a light irradiation step of irradiating visible light onto the fingerprint raised on the surface of the specimen by the exposure step. The visible light is an electromagnetic wave having a wavelength of approximately 400-800 nm. A light irradiation source is not particularly limited as long as it can irradiate an effective amount of light. A general irradiation source is usable, and examples thereof include the following irradiation sources: carbon arc, mercury vapor arc, fluorescent lamp, argon glow lamp, incandescent lamp, halogen lamp, high pressure mercury lamp, ultra-high pressure mercury lamp, high pressure mercury lamp, low pressure mercury lamp, xenon short lamp, high power water-cooled xenon lamp, xenon flash lamp, and metal halide lamps, such as gallium halide lamp and thallium halide lamp. It is also possible to attach a filter to the irradiation source in order to irradiate light having a desired wavelength onto the fingerprint image, thereby obtaining a fluorescent fingerprint image. The fluorescent fingerprint image thus obtained is preserved by being photographed using a digital camera or the like through the filter that cuts the wavelength of irradiation light.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The composition for detecting a latent fingerprint according to the present invention ensures obtaining a clear fingerprint image even from an old fingerprint having little moisture after the passage of time. This seems to be because the dye also melts into the fatty acid of the latent fingerprint and generates fluorescence.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">With the conventional cyanoacrylate method, a large amount of 2-cyanoacrylic acid aster is polymerized onto and adhered to a latent fingerprint. Therefore, the whitened 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer is strongly adhered to the specimen, and it is necessary to use an organic solvent, such as acetone, or cut off the polymerized part in order to wipe off the polymerized body. Hence, for example, a specimen made of plastic may be unreturnable to the original state. On the other hand, the composition for detecting a latent fingerprint according to the present invention has excellent reducibility. Such a small amount of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer, which is a visible lower limit or less, is used together with the dye so as to increase the amount, thus permitting visualization and detection. This minimizes the attachment of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer to the latent fingerprint, thus preventing the attachment to unnecessary parts. Moreover, because the composition for detecting a latent fingerprint is powder, a necessary and sufficient amount of a reagent to be gasified according to an exposure volume can be used quantitatively. Hence, the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer is less apt to be whitened, and therefore the fingerprint ridges are not thickened, thus enhancing detectability of the fingerprint.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">The fingerprint detection using the composition for detecting a latent fingerprint according to the present invention eliminates the need for a fingerprint detection using ultraviolet. Therefore, after detecting the fingerprint, the fingerprint is lifted while being confirmed by a wavelength variable light source. This ensures that a non-damaged DNA is liftable from the fingerprint attached to the specimen.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Embodiments of the latent fingerprint detection apparatus for conducting the latent fingerprint detection method according to the present invention are described below with reference to the drawings.</p>

The bottom of the heat generator <b>17</b> is closed by a bottom plate <b>25</b> having a water passage hole <b>23</b>, and the water passage hole <b>23</b> is closed by an unwoven sheet <b>27</b> that is the member having water permeability. The partition member <b>14</b> has a side wall having a cylindrical shape and a bottom that is hollow and has an approximately hemispherical shape. The side wall is disposed coaxially with a circumferential wall of the outer container <b>13</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">An upper open surface of the heat generator <b>17</b> is covered with a lid member <b>19</b> having a plurality of openings formed in a region corresponding to an upper open surface of the partition member <b>14</b>. The openings of the lid member <b>19</b> are closed by a hot-melt film <b>22</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The hydrolytic exothermic agent <b>21</b> is allowed to fill a space formed by the circumferential wall of the outer container <b>13</b>, the partition member <b>14</b>, and the unwoven sheet <b>27</b>. A powder chemical agent <b>20</b>, which is to be gasified by heating so as to attach to the latent fingerprint on a specimen <b>41</b>, is stored in a chemical agent storage part <b>15</b> partitionally formed inside the partitioned member <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">Leg parts <b>29</b> are disposed on the bottom of the heat generator <b>17</b>, and a clearance is formed below the bottom plate <b>25</b> so as to allow water to flow therethrough.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The outer container <b>13</b> that is a component member of the heat generator <b>17</b> is not particularly limited as long as it has heat resistance to the heating temperature of the hydrolysis exothermic agent <b>21</b> stored inside the heat generator <b>17</b>. There are, for example, heat-resistant plastic container, paper container, metal container, ceramic container, and glass container. The outer container <b>13</b> is preferably has a diameter of 5 cm or more, more preferably 5-10 cm. The height of the heat generator <b>17</b> preferably has a height of 2-9 cm, more preferably 3-8 cm. The outer container <b>13</b> preferably has a volume of 40 cm<sup>3 </sup>or more, more preferably 100-480 cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The hydrolytic exothermic agent <b>21</b> is the material that generates heat by itself upon reaction with water. It is possible to use, for example, calcium oxide (quicklime), magnesium chloride, aluminum chloride, calcium chloride, and iron chloride. The heating temperature is preferably 250-450Â° C. The content of the hydrolytic exothermic agent <b>21</b> in the first embodiment is approximately 40-400 g, for example, when using calcium oxide, and the hydrolytic exothermic agent <b>21</b> is allowed to fill the entire interior of the heat generator <b>17</b> which is partitionally formed by the partitioned member <b>14</b>. This configuration ensures that the chemical agent <b>20</b> loaded in the chemical agent storage part <b>15</b> can be heated to 350Â° C. or more by the hydrolytic exothermic agent <b>21</b> in at least one minute after starting heating.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">When using the heating evaporation device <b>11</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint in the first embodiment, the heating evaporation device <b>11</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint is immersed in a water-filled water supply container <b>39</b> (see <figref>FIG. 2</figref>). Then, the water flows from the clearance formed by the leg parts <b>29</b> of the heat generator <b>17</b> and enters through the water passage holes <b>23</b> disposed on the bottom of the outer container <b>13</b>. The water contacts the hydrolysis exothermic agent <b>21</b>, and by the heat of reaction occurred at that time, the chemical agent <b>20</b> in the chemical agent storage part <b>15</b> is heated, gasified, and evaporated. Consequently, the hot-melt film <b>22</b> is melted and discharged to the outside (into a specimen storage part <b>63</b> of the storage case <b>43</b>) through the openings of the lid member <b>19</b>. The hot-melt film <b>22</b> is thermally melted by the heat dissipation from the hydrolysis exothermic agent <b>21</b>, the heat of the outer container <b>13</b>, and the contact with the evaporated chemical agent <b>20</b>. Therefore, from a relatively early time of the evaporation, the evaporated chemical agent <b>20</b> is efficiently released outside through the openings of the lid member <b>19</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">In the present embodiment, the composition for detecting a latent fingerprint described earlier is used as the chemical agent <b>20</b> to be loaded in the chemical agent storage part <b>15</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The heat generator <b>17</b> heats the chemical agent <b>20</b> to be loaded in the chemical agent storage part <b>15</b> so as to generate a mixed gas of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester (monomer) and the dye, With the heating evaporation device <b>11</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint according to the first embodiment, the chemical agent <b>20</b> stored in the chemical agent storage part <b>15</b> is gasified and evaporated by heating so as to attach to the latent fingerprint on the specimen. Temperature control and the like are complicated when the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester having extremely high activity is used as in the conventional cyanoacrylate method. On the other hand, the present invention employs the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer and hence ensures improvement in handling properties and stability, such as temperature control and quantitativity of the chemical agent <b>20</b>. Additionally, the use of the heat generator <b>17</b> of the present invention ensures complete depolymerization of various kinds of 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymers.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">Next, a description is given of the operation of the heating evaporation device <b>11</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint, which has the foregoing configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">The heating evaporation device <b>11</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint according to the first embodiment is capable of rapidly heating the chemical agent <b>20</b> loaded in the chemical agent storage part <b>15</b> by ensuring that it reaches high temperatures, for example, 250-450Â° C. in three minutes by the heat generator <b>17</b> using the heat of reaction of the hydrolysis exothermic agent <b>21</b> that heats by itself upon reaction with water. The chemical agent <b>20</b> is heated by the hydrolysis exothermic agent <b>21</b> to 350Â° C. or more in at least one minute after starting heating, and quickly reaches high temperatures in a short time, thus generating a high-concentration mixed gas of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">Moreover, the heat generator <b>17</b> heats the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye at the high temperatures of 350Â° C. or more, thereby ensuring the gasification and evaporation of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer and the dye which differ in polymerization degree. In addition, the vapor generated from the heat generator <b>17</b> facilitates the polymerization of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester attached to the latent fingerprint and the whitening of the produced 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer. It is therefore possible to actualize a clear latent fingerprint even when detecting a fingerprint in a wide space, and even under extremely dry conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">Subsequently, by exposing the specimen <b>41</b> (see <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) to the mixed gas atmosphere of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye, the polymerization of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the adsorption of the dye occur selectively on the latent fingerprint on the specimen <b>41</b>, thereby obtaining a dyed (fluorescent) fingerprint image.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">Next, a description is given of a latent fingerprint detection apparatus <b>100</b> and a latent fingerprint detection method according to a second embodiment using the foregoing heating evaporation device <b>11</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a partially cut-away perspective view showing the latent fingerprint detection apparatus <b>100</b> according to the second embodiment using the heating evaporation device <b>11</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">The latent fingerprint detection method according to the present embodiment may use only the heating evaporation device <b>11</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint, but preferably uses the latent fingerprint detection apparatus <b>100</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. This ensures that the polymerization of 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the adsorption of the dye are quantitatively and efficiently carried out with respect to the latent fingerprint on the specimen <b>41</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">The latent fingerprint detection apparatus <b>100</b> of the second embodiment includes the heating evaporation device <b>11</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint, and the storage case <b>43</b> as described above. The storage case <b>43</b> stores therein the heating evaporation device <b>11</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint, and the specimen <b>41</b>. The gasified 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the gasified dye are allowed to fill the storage case <b>43</b> by heating the chemical agent <b>20</b> in the heating evaporation device <b>1</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">The storage case <b>43</b> is a box having a rectangular parallelepiped shape, and includes a body <b>51</b> made up of a side wall <b>47</b> and a bottom wall <b>49</b>, and a lid body <b>55</b> that serves as a top plate and closes an upper opening <b>53</b> of the body <b>51</b>. The heating evaporation device <b>11</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint is put in the water-filled water supply container <b>39</b>, and is disposed on the bottom wall <b>49</b> of the storage case <b>43</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">The lid body <b>55</b> of the storage case <b>43</b> includes a flat plate part having approximately the same shape as the upper opening <b>53</b> of the body <b>51</b>, a hinge <b>57</b> connected to the upper opening <b>53</b> so as to permit rotation of one side of the flat plate part, and a hook <b>59</b> that is disposed on the side wall <b>47</b> on the opposite side of the hinge <b>57</b>, and locks an opening-closing end of the lid body <b>55</b>. The side wall <b>47</b> of the storage case <b>43</b> includes a transparent window <b>48</b> that permits observation of the interior of the storage case <b>43</b>. The storage case <b>43</b> thus configured has predetermined air tightness under the condition that the lid body <b>55</b> closing the upper opening <b>53</b> is locked by the hook <b>59</b>. The specimen storage part <b>63</b> is located above the bottom wall <b>49</b> in the interior of the storage case <b>43</b>, and the specimen <b>41</b> is stored in the specimen storage part <b>63</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">In the latent fingerprint detection apparatus <b>100</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the columnar specimen <b>41</b> is directly mounted on the bottom wall <b>49</b>. The specimen <b>41</b> may be suspended from a hook shank or the like hanged on the side wall <b>47</b>, depending on the type and shape of the specimen <b>41</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">Alternatively, a punching metal (plate body) having a plurality of through holes, a metal mesh, or the like is disposed in the interior of the storage case <b>43</b>, and the specimen <b>41</b> may be mounted thereon. In this case, the heating evaporation device <b>11</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint can be stored in a lower part of the specimen storage part <b>63</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">The material for forming the storage case <b>43</b> is not particularly limited as long as it has heat resistance to such an extent as not to be melted and deformed by heat. For example, corrugated cardboard, metals, such as aluminum alloy, copper alloy, steel, and stainless steel, and engineering plastics, such as polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, and polycarbonate, may be used. Contamination or the like due to other specimen is preventable by using a disposable storage case made of a corrugated cardboard or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">When detecting a latent fingerprint on the specimen <b>41</b>, firstly, the lid body <b>55</b> of the storage case <b>43</b> is opened, and the specimen <b>41</b> is inserted from the upper opening <b>53</b> and mounted on the bottom wall <b>49</b>. Therefore, the heating evaporation device <b>11</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint is immersed in the water supply container <b>39</b> which is filled with water in advance and is mounted on the bottom wall <b>49</b>. Then, the lid body <b>55</b> is fixed by the hook <b>59</b> so as to close the upper opening <b>53</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">In the heating step of the latent fingerprint detection method according to the present embodiment, the chemical agent <b>20</b> that is the composition for detecting a latent fingerprint, which is a mixture of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and a specific dye, is heated by the hydrolysis heating agent <b>21</b> in the heat generator <b>17</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">In the exposure step, the heating of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer and the dye causes stably and effectively the depolymerization and gasification of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer and the gasification of the dye, and the generated mixed gas of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye is allowed to evaporate and fill the storage case <b>43</b>. Accordingly, the specimen <b>14</b> is exposed to the atmosphere of the gasified 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the gasified dye.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">This ensures that the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye evaporated by the heating evaporation device <b>11</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint, and the vapor is attached to the latent fingerprint on the specimen <b>41</b>. That is, in the storage case <b>43</b> filled with the mixed gas of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye, the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester is polymerized (repolymerized) in the latent fingerprint region on the specimen <b>41</b> by using, as a catalyst, basic ingredients and moisture that are the main ingredients of the latent fingerprint, and at the same time, the dye is selectively adsorbed onto the latent fingerprint region, thereby forming a dyed fingerprint (specifically, a fluorescent fingerprint). By jetting the vapor together with the gasified chemical agent <b>20</b>, a clear fingerprint is detectable even when the fingerprint is detected in a wide space, and under a dry condition.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">Thus, the latent fingerprint detection apparatus <b>100</b> and the latent fingerprint detection method according to the second embodiment require neither flames for volatilizing the chemical agent <b>20</b> nor a heater that needs a power source.

      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">That is, the latent fingerprint detection apparatus <b>200</b> of the third embodiment produces the operational advantage that only the mixed gas of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye, which contains no vapor evaporated by the heating evaporation device <b>11</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint, is attachable to the latent fingerprint on the specimen <b>41</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">Therefore, when there is the possibility that excessive whitening of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester due to the vapor exerts adverse effect on the fingerprint detection, for example, when the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye are allowed to attach to the latent fingerprint on the specimen <b>41</b> in a narrow space, a satisfactory latent fingerprint is detectable by using the latent fingerprint detection apparatus <b>200</b> of the third embodiment.</p>

The chemical agent <b>20</b> is to be gasified by the heating evaporation device <b>11</b> for detecting a latent fingerprint so as to allow the gasified chemical agent <b>20</b> to fill the storage case <b>43</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0120">[x] A composition for detecting a latent fingerprint contains a 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer and a dye. The dye is an anthraquinone-based dye or naphthalimide-based dye.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">With the latent fingerprint detection method having the configuration described in the above [i], it is easy to handle, and a clear latent fingerprint is detectable. Additionally, the latent fingerprint is detectable in the visible light region, thus causing no DNA damage to the latent fingerprint.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">With, the latent fingerprint detection method having the configuration described in the above [ii], the mixed gas of 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye is generated by heating. By exposing the specimen to the atmosphere of the mixed gas of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye, the polymerization of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid, ester and the adsorption of the dye occur selectively on the latent fingerprint on the specimen, thereby obtaining a dyed fingerprint image by a one-time processing.</p>

      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">With the latent fingerprint detection method having the configuration described in the above [v], the latent fingerprint is detectable more efficiently.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0126">With the latent fingerprint detection method having the configuration described in the above [vi], it is easy to handle on-site, and the latent fingerprint is detectable clearly.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0127">With the heating evaporation device for detecting a latent fingerprint having the configuration described in the above [vii], the chemical agent can be heated to the high temperatures of 250-450Â° C. in a short time by the heat generator using the heat of reaction of the hydrolysis exothermic agent that heats by itself upon reaction with water. By allowing the chemical agent to evaporate from the heat generator while being heated at the high temperatures of 350Â° C. or more, the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye are gasified. By heating the chemical agent at the high temperatures of 250Â° C. or more, besides the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester, a 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer composed of a monomer alone, a 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymer composed of a plurality of kinds of monomers, a mixture of 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester polymers that differ in polymerization degree, a compound containing a 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester incorporating therein an alkyl group and a vinyl group, and a copolymer including a pigment having a higher gasification temperature can be depolymerized, gasified, and evaporated. By exposing the specimen to the atmosphere of the mixed gas of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye, the polymerization of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the adsorption of the dye occur selectively on the latent fingerprint on the specimen, thereby obtaining a dyed fingerprint image by the one-time processing. The heating evaporation device for detecting a latent fingerprint achieves the high temperatures in the short time, and hence a high-concentration chemical agent gas occurs. This ensures that a clear latent fingerprint is actualized without requiring flames or a power source.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0128">With the heating evaporation device for detecting a latent fingerprint having the configuration as described in the above [viii], it quickly reaches high temperatures in a short time. Therefore, a high-concentration 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester gas, and a high-concentration mixed gas of the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester and the dye occur, thus allowing a clearer latent fingerprint to be actualized by the one-time processing.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0129">With the latent fingerprint detection apparatus having the configuration described in the above [ix], a clear latent fingerprint is simply detectable anywhere with a lightweight simple structure without using flames and a stationary power source.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0130">With the composition for detecting a latent fingerprint having the configuration described in the above [x], there is no possibility that the 2-cyanoacrylic acid ester generated by heating is repolymerized before reaching a fingerprint, and hence the latent fingerprint is detectable efficiently.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0131">While the present invention has been described in detail with reference to the specific embodiments, it is apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications are applicable without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
