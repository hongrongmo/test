      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">This invention relates to the field of water attractions, and more specifically, to water rides involving a flowing body of water having sufficient characteristics, including area, speed and thickness, to allow for surfboard, skimboard, snowboard, skateboard, bodyboarding, bodysurfing, inner-tubing style maneuvers or other water riding maneuvers (collectively, “boardriding maneuvers”).</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Conventional water attractions that allow for boardriding maneuvers, typically involve a flowing body of water. In these attractions, the flowing body of water is of such depth that the surface boundary layer effects of the flowing body of water over a limited number of wave forming surfaces significantly influence the rider's ability to perform boardriding maneuvers. Such “sheet flow” water attractions may simulate a stationary unbreaking ocean wave or, through the use of a naturally-occurring ocean wave shape, may create a stationary barreling wave.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Such existing “sheet flow” water attractions are limited in the number of boardriding maneuvers available to the rider as the shallow nature and speed of the flowing body of water and the limited number of wave forming surfaces restrict or limit the ability of the rider to perform a variety of boardriding maneuvers.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In addition, the number of riders capable of safely riding at one time on existing water attractions is limited due to design or physical limitations. Thus there is a need in the field of water attractions for new and useful water attractions that allow riders to perform a variety of boardriding maneuvers and allow for an increased number of riders to utilize the water attraction at one time in a manner that allows sufficient room for each individual rider to utilize the water attraction safely.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present invention relates to water attractions involving a flowing body of water on a surface which preferably allows a rider or riders to engage in boardriding maneuvers on surfaces that are irregular and may not resemble naturally-occurring ocean wave shapes. Such irregular shapes may possibly include, but are not limited to: quarter-pipes; half-pipes; table-tops; bowls; ramps; spines; elbows; and other similar shapes. Such irregular shapes may include half-pipes in which the sidewalls are parallel and/or non-parallel or a combination of both. Due to the nature of a flowing body of water, the sidewalls of the present invention are generally non-parallel to allow for the rider(s) to take advantage of more of the surface area of each sidewall. In existing “half-pipe” water attractions with parallel or substantially parallel sidewalls, the rider(s) is unable to take full advantage of the sidewall's surface area from the transition up to the lip line due to the characteristics of water flowing in the vertical direction. In addition, the different forms of irregular shapes may be used independently or in conjunction or in combination with each other to create additional irregular shapes. Furthermore, shapes may be combined at varying angles and elevations to create surfaces allowing for boardriding maneuvers of increasing difficulty and creativity.</p>

      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The following description of the preferred embodiments of the invention is not intended to limit the invention to this preferred embodiment, but rather to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use this invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Referring now to the invention in more detail, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 - 3</figref>, half-pipe water attraction <b>10</b> of a preferred embodiment includes sidewalls <b>18</b> adjacent to middle section <b>16</b> and sidewalls <b>20</b> adjacent to safety chute section <b>72</b>. The sidewalls <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> may be either parallel or non-parallel sidewalls. The water attraction of the preferred embodiment preferably enables one or more riders to perform boardriding maneuvers. In some embodiments, as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the water attraction <b>10</b> may further include a water delivery system <b>12</b>. The water delivery system <b>12</b> preferably functions to create a flowing body of water moving in the direction of arrows <b>14</b> toward a safety chute section <b>72</b>. The flowing body of water may flow over the middle section <b>16</b>, over each sidewall <b>18</b>, over each sidewall <b>20</b>, to elevated water recovery sections <b>22</b>, located at an elevation above where the sidewalls <b>18</b> terminate, to safety transition section <b>71</b>, down declined sections <b>26</b>, and to a water recovery section <b>24</b> in the rear of the embodiment, in which such water recovery section <b>24</b> may be at an elevation above or below the water delivery system <b>12</b>. The water collected in the water recovery sections <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> may flow into a water retrieval section <b>30</b> (shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>) and returned to the water delivery system <b>12</b>. The water delivery system <b>12</b> may include a pump or other fluid accelerating device. The water attraction <b>10</b> of the preferred embodiments preferably functions to enable a rider or riders to engage in boardriding maneuvers on surfaces that are irregular and may not resemble naturally-occurring ocean wave shapes. Such irregular shapes may possibly include, but are not limited to: quarter-pipes; half-pipes; table-tops; bowls; ramps; spines; elbows; and other similar shapes. Such irregular shapes may include half-pipes in which the sidewalls are parallel and/or non-parallel or a combination of both. In addition, the different forms of irregular shapes may be used independently or in conjunction or in combination with each other to create additional irregular shapes. Furthermore, shapes may be combined at varying angles and elevations to create surfaces allowing for boardriding maneuvers of increasing difficulty and creativity. Furthermore, water attraction <b>10</b> of the preferred embodiments, preferably functions to enable an increased number of riders to utilize the water attraction at the same time in a manner that allows sufficient room for each individual rider to utilize the water attraction safely.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In more detail, still referring to the invention of <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref>, there is shown an embodiment allowing a rider to perform boardriding maneuvers on the middle section <b>16</b> and each sidewall <b>18</b>. The sidewalls <b>18</b> or <b>20</b> may be concave, planar or convex, or a combination of the aforementioned and may have the same radius of curvature or slope, or, in other embodiments, the non-planar sidewalls may have a varying radius of curvature or slope. The flowing body of water <b>14</b> creates an activity section by flowing onto both the middle section <b>16</b> and either or both sidewalls <b>18</b> in which a rider may perform boardriding maneuvers on the middle section <b>16</b> and on either or both sidewalls <b>18</b> in a continuous and unimpeded manner. The activity section may include surfaces that are irregular and may not resemble naturally-occurring ocean wave shapes. Such irregular shapes may possibly include, but are not limited to: quarter-pipes, half-pipes, table-tops, bowls, ramps, spines, elbows and other similar shapes. Such irregular shapes may include half-pipes in which the sidewalls <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> are parallel and/or non-parallel or a combination of both. In addition, the different forms of irregular shapes may be used independently or in conjunction or in combination with each other to create additional irregular shapes. Furthermore, shapes may be combined at varying angles and elevations to create surfaces allowing for boardriding maneuvers of increasing difficulty and creativity.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-2</figref>, a rider exiting the activity section may be swept upon either water recovery section <b>22</b> and possibly upon safety transition section <b>71</b>, down declined sections <b>26</b>, and/or upon safety chute section <b>72</b>, to water recovery section <b>24</b>. The water recovery sections may include a surface having a plurality of apertures or slots. The water may flow through the slots or apertures such that it may be recovered and recycled through the system. The slots or apertures may be sized and configured such that a rider may safely stand or ride on the water recover section without tripping on or falling through the slots or apertures. A rider performing boardriding maneuvers upon the sidewall <b>18</b> may exit the activity section upon water recovery section <b>22</b>, upon safety transition section <b>71</b>, and possibly down declined section <b>26</b>. A rider performing boardriding maneuvers upon the middle section <b>16</b> may exit the activity section upon the safety chute section <b>72</b> and/or water recovery section <b>24</b>. The safety chute section <b>72</b> and the sidewalls <b>20</b> are designed to safely transition riders to the water recovery section <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In further detail, still referring to the invention of <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the surface of water attraction <b>10</b> is sufficiently smooth such that a rider may be safely swept over the surfaces of the water attraction including the middle section <b>16</b>, sidewalls <b>18</b>, water recovery sections <b>22</b>, sidewalls <b>20</b>, declined sections <b>26</b>, safety transition section <b>71</b>, safety chute section <b>72</b>, and to water recovery section <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In order to construct the water attraction <b>10</b> of adequate size to fully accommodate individual and multiple riders, for purposes of scale and not limitation, referring to <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the dimensions of the middle section, which may be either planar or non-planar, <b>16</b> can be between 1 and 50 meters in length <b>32</b>, between 0.05 and 5 meters in height <b>55</b>, and between 1 and 30 meters in width <b>39</b>, although the width may be of such distance that is only limited by physical and cost restrictions. The height <b>35</b> of the sidewalls <b>18</b> can vary from 0.2 and 5 meters in height. As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the downstream angle <b>21</b> of the sidewalls <b>18</b> can vary from 10 degrees to 60 degrees off from the sidewalls <b>20</b>. The middle section <b>16</b> can be planar or slightly curved or curved.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The water attraction <b>10</b>, including the activity section, may be made from a rigid or substantially rigid substrate such as concrete, metal, fiberglass, plastic or other similar material. The rigid or substantially rigid material may be covered in a layer of impact resistant padding covered with a substantially waterproof membrane and/or sealant.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown a top view of the preferred embodiment <b>10</b>, with section views <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, shown in <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> respectively. Now referring to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, depicting a longitudinal section view <b>4</b> through the water attraction <b>10</b>, the water recovery section <b>24</b>, feeds a water retrieval section <b>30</b> which functions to catch the water from the water recovery section <b>24</b> and allow the water to return to the front of the attraction where it can be redirected through the water directing mechanism <b>33</b>, such as a nozzle, and re-distributed onto the ride surface <b>16</b> and either or both sidewalls <b>18</b> by the water delivery system <b>12</b>. Although not depicted in the FIGURES, the water recovery section <b>22</b> also feeds a water retrieval section which allows water to return to the front of the attraction where it can be redirected through the water direction mechanism <b>33</b> and re-distributed onto the ride surface <b>16</b> and either or both sidewalls <b>18</b> by the water delivery system <b>12</b>. The inclination <b>36</b>, of the ride surface <b>16</b>, can vary substantially from horizontal to an angle of 45°. The inclination <b>34</b> of the water recovery section <b>24</b>, which drains water originating from the water delivery system <b>12</b>, in which such water flows without a significant “change in direction.” In this case, a “change in direction” is defined as altering the original flow direction by more than 160°in a plane substantially defined by the sheet of flowing water, before entering either water recovery section <b>22</b> or <b>24</b>. The inclination <b>34</b> of the water recovery section may be between 0° and 30°.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Referring now to the transverse section through the preferred embodiment <b>10</b> in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, there is a width component <b>39</b>, to the middle section <b>16</b>, which separates the sidewalls <b>18</b>. The middle section <b>16</b> can be slightly curved or substantially planar. The sidewalls <b>18</b> can be shaped as a curve, including convex, concave, ellipse, complex curve shapes, or can be substantially planar depending on the desired ride shape. The final angle of inclination <b>37</b> of the sidewall <b>18</b> can vary significantly from 5° to a maximum of 150°, in which case the sidewall <b>18</b> may extend vertically over a portion of itself. Furthermore, the final angle of inclination may vary along the length <b>57</b> (as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>) of the sidewall <b>18</b> and can be increasing, decreasing, or varying. The height <b>35</b> of the sidewalls <b>18</b> can vary between 0.05 meters and 10 meters. Furthermore, the height <b>35</b> of the sidewall <b>18</b> can vary along the length of a single sidewall <b>18</b> by increasing the height, decreasing the height, or a combination thereof along the length <b>57</b> of the sidewall <b>18</b> and can vary significantly from one sidewall <b>18</b> to the opposing sidewall <b>18</b>. The length <b>57</b> of each respective sidewall <b>18</b> can vary significantly from a length of 1 meter to 50 meters, and other embodiments may have opposing sidewalls of different lengths.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Referring now to the invention as shown in <figref>FIGS. 6-8</figref>, an alternative preferred embodiment of the water attraction includes a sidewall <b>18</b>, a sidewall <b>20</b>, a water recovery section <b>22</b>, a safety transition section <b>71</b>, and a declined section <b>26</b> forming a quarter-pipe <b>40</b>. On the opposite side of the sidewalls <b>18</b> and <b>42</b> of quarter-pipe <b>40</b>, there is an angled sidewall <b>44</b> provided for safety purposes. The safety chute section <b>72</b>, sidewall <b>20</b> and a sidewall opposite sidewall <b>20</b> are designed to safely transition riders to the water recovery section <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">As shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the width of the middle section <b>16</b> is of a width <b>62</b> that is only limited by cost and space restrictions. In this embodiment, the sidewall <b>18</b> may be oriented in such a way to the middle section <b>16</b> and the flow of water <b>14</b> such that one or more riders may perform boardriding maneuvers. The general operating characteristics of the quarter pipe embodiment <b>40</b> are similar to the first preferred embodiment <b>10</b> in which the water recovery section <b>24</b> feeds the water retrieval section <b>30</b> (as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>), which feeds the water directing mechanism <b>33</b> (as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>), which then feeds the flow of water <b>14</b> onto the middle section <b>16</b> and sidewall <b>42</b> via the water delivery system <b>12</b>. Furthermore, as shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, the angle <b>47</b> of the sidewall <b>18</b> can vary significantly, similarly to previously described angle <b>21</b> in the first preferred embodiment <b>10</b>. Furthermore, the height <b>54</b> of the final angle of inclination <b>56</b> may vary as described previously with respect to the first preferred embodiment <b>10</b> as may the height, width and lengths of the respective surfaces.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Additional embodiments of this invention over which a body of water flows and creates a shape that appears in skateboard, snowboard and other action sports parks such as a bowl, hip, elbow, spine, and other shapes, may allow a rider or riders to ride up inclined sidewalls, substantially change directions, travel down the respective sidewall, across substantially flat or curved middle sections or other connection sidewalls, up separate sidewalls to once again substantially change direction, ride down the respective sidewall and back onto substantially flat middle sections. The body of water, after flowing over any substantially flat or curved middle sections and inclined sidewall(s), then may travel onto a water recovery section to be reused. In addition, such additional surface shapes may have a flowing body of water created by a water delivery system moving in a number of different directions and such water delivery system is configured in a manner that allows for a flowing body of water to travel over such additional surface shapes.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">As a person skilled in the art will recognize from the previous detailed description and from the figures and claims, modifications and changes can be made to the preferred embodiments of the invention without departing from the scope of this invention defined in the following claims.
