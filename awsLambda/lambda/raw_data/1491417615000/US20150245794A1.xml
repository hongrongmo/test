      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The present disclosure relates in general to patient monitoring and in particular to oximeter patient monitors capable of determining perfusion index measurements.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Oximeter systems providing measurements of a monitored patient have become the standard of care in many patient care settings, including surgical, post surgical, neonatal, general ward, home care, physical training, and the like. In general, oximeter systems accept one or more noninvasive signals from an optical sensor or probe capable of emitting multiple wavelengths of light into a tissue site and capable of detecting light after attenuated by the tissue site. The optical sensor generally outputs intensity signal data. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a photoplethysmograph intensity signal <b>100</b> output by an oximeter sensor. An oximeter does not directly detect absorption, and hence does not directly measure a standard plethysmograph waveform. However, the standard plethysmograph can be derived by observing that the detected intensity signal <b>100</b> is merely an out of phase version of an absorption profile known to one of skill in the art. That is, the peak detected intensity <b>102</b>, generally corresponds to a minimum absorption, and minimum detected intensity <b>104</b>, generally corresponds to a maximum absorption. Further, a rapid rise in absorption during an inflow phase of the plethysmograph is reflected in a rapid decline <b>106</b> in intensity. Likewise, a gradual decline in absorption during the outflow phase of the plethysmograph is reflected in a gradual increase <b>108</b> in detected intensity.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a flow calculator <b>200</b> which receives a processed signal <b>202</b> responsive to at least one of the intensity signals output from the sensor. In an embodiment, the flow calculator outputs an indication of blood flow, such as, for example, a perfusion index (PI) <b>204</b>. In an embodiment, the PI <b>204</b> comprises a relative indication of pulse strength at a monitoring site. For example, the PI <b>204</b> may be defined as the ratio of the wavelength's (A) AC signal to the DC signal, or the percentage of pulsatile signal to non-pulsatile signal, according to the following:</p>

However, using the foregoing scale, the PI bar <b>324</b> can be used as a diagnostic tool during low perfusion for the accurate prediction of illness severity, especially in neonates. Moreover, the rate of change in the PI bar <b>324</b> can be indicative of blood loss, sleep arousal, sever hypertension, pain management, the presence or absence of drugs, or the like. According to one embodiment, a measurement below about â1.25%â may indicate medical situations in need of caregiver attention, specifically in monitored neonates. Because of the relevance of about â1.25%â, the PI bar <b>324</b> may advantageously include level indicia that switch sides of the PI bar <b>324</b>, thus highlighting any readings below about that threshold. Moreover, behavior of the PI bar <b>324</b>, as discussed below, may advantageously draw attention to monitored values below such a threshold.</p>

In one embodiment, the PI bar <b>324</b> shows a static value of perfusion for a given time period, such as, for example, one or more pulses. In another embodiment, or functional setting, the PI bar <b>324</b> may advantageously pulse with a pulse rate, may hold the last reading and optionally fade until the next reading, may indicate historical readings through colors or fades, traces or the like. Additionally, the PI bar <b>324</b> may advantageously change colors, flash, increasingly flash, or the like to indicate worsening measured values of perfusion.</p>

In an embodiment, the trend data is uploaded to an external computing device through, for example, a multipurpose sensor connector or other input output systems such as USB, serial or parallel ports, computing networks, or the like.

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0012">Aspects of the present disclosure include a system which provides a more accurate indication of PI. In one embodiment, the wavelength used to determine PI is in the infrared (IR) spectrum. IR wavelengths are more independent of saturation than are wavelengths in the Red (R) spectrum. As a result, when the saturation changes, the PI calculated from a R wavelength tends to vary greater than the PI calculated from a IR wavelength. Although the IR intensity signal data is less responsive to saturation than various other intensity channels, the IR intensity signal remains somewhat susceptible to motion-induced noise, distortion and the like. In general, PI measurements during lower signal quality or distortion generally trends the PI too high. As understood by an artisan from the disclosure herein, higher PI measurements should correlate to better perfusion through the tissue site, and lower PI measurements should correlate to lower perfusion through the tissue site. Thus, noise may cause a patient monitor to give a caregiver the indication that a patient has better perfusion through a measurement site than is actually the case.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0013">Based at least thereon, embodiments of the present disclosure seek to reduce an error between a calculated measurement of PI and actual conditions. In an embodiment, a baseline perfusion index (âbaseline PIâ) is determined and used to improve measurements during motion conditions. For example, a smoother may advantageously determine a baseline PI during strong signal quality, high signal confidence conditions, and use that baseline PI or a statistical combination of baseline PIs instead of or in addition to the current PI that is being influenced by noise. In an embodiment, the smoother selects the lower PI value as the output PI value. This is because motion noise tends to increase PI, thus the lower PI value tends to be the more accurate value.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0014">In an embodiment, PI is calculated using at least two different calculation techniques. The two different calculations are analyzed and a PI indication is determined. In an embodiment, the lower of the two PI values is chosen.

In an embodiment, leveraging includes outputting the baseline perfusion index when a current perfusion index measurement is higher than the baseline perfusion index. In an embodiment, leveraging includes outputting a current perfusion index measurement when the baseline perfusion index is higher than the current perfusion index measurement. In an embodiment, the signal is responsive to an IR intensity signal.</p>

In an embodiment, an alarm is included which is configured to alert a caregiver when the output meets predetermined criteria. In an embodiment, the processor is programmed to output the current PI when the signal data is relatively calm or when the current PI is lower than the baseline PI.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0017">In an embodiment, a method of determining an indication of perfusion index in a patient monitor is disclosed. The method includes the steps of receiving plethysmographic data, calculating two or more indications of perfusion index using at least two different calculation techniques, and determining a final indication of perfusion index based on the indications of perfusion index.

In an embodiment, the final indication of perfusion index is determined by averaging the indications of perfusion index.</p>

In an embodiment, the processor is configured to select the calculator which calculates the lowest indication of perfusion index. In an embodiment, the processor utilizes both calculation techniques. In an embodiment, the processor is further configured to select the lowest indication of perfusion index as the resulting indication of perfusion index.</p>

      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0031">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a simplified block diagram of a smoothed perfusion index generator <b>400</b>, according to an embodiment of the disclosure. As shown, the generator <b>400</b> includes a flow calculator <b>402</b>, ad smoother <b>404</b> and optional indications of noise, including a measure of distortion <b>406</b>, signal quality <b>408</b>, and waveform quality <b>410</b>. In an embodiment, a data signal <b>420</b> responsive to an intensity signal is input into the flow calculator <b>402</b>, and a current value <b>422</b> of PI is calculated. A skilled artisan will recognize a number of calculations that can determine values of perfusion, including, for example, the foregoing ratio of the AC signal to the DC signal. The current value <b>422</b> of PI, which in an embodiment is subject to noise and distortion in the data signal <b>420</b>, is input into the smoother <b>404</b>, which reduces an error between the current value <b>422</b> of PI and actual perfusion conditions. For example, the smoother <b>404</b> may advantageously determine a baseline PI, and depending upon an indication of some or all of an amount of distortion, noise, signal quality, and/or waveform quality in the data signal <b>422</b>, substitute or combine the baseline PI for or with the current value <b>422</b> to generate an output PI <b>430</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0032">In an embodiment, the wavelength used to determine PI is in the infrared (IR) spectrum. IR wavelengths are more independent of saturation than are wavelengths in, for example, the Red (R) spectrum. As a result, when the saturation changes, the PI calculated from a R wavelength tends to vary greater than the PI calculated from a IR wavelength.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0033">In an embodiment, the distortion signal <b>406</b> may comprise a Boolean value indicating whether the data signal <b>422</b> includes, for example, motion-induced noise. Although an artisan will recognize from the disclosure herein a number of methodologies for deriving the distortion signal <b>406</b>, derivation of a Boolean distortion signal is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,606,511, incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, or in addition to, the signal quality signal <b>408</b> may comprise a Boolean value indicating whether the data signal <b>422</b> meets various waveform criteria Although an artisan will recognize from the disclosure herein a number of methodologies for deriving the signal quality signal <b>408</b>, derivation of a Boolean distortion signal is disclosed in the '511 patent. Alternatively, or in addition to, a feature extractor <b>440</b> may advantageously produce waveform quality outputs <b>410</b>, indicative of waveform quality or waveform shape. Although an artisan will recognize from the disclosure herein a number of methodologies for deriving the waveform quality signal <b>410</b>, derivation thereof is disclosed in the '065 patent.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0034">Thus, the smoother <b>404</b> accepts one or more or different indicators of the quality of the data signal <b>420</b>, and determines how to smooth the PI output to reduces errors between data trends and actual perfusion conditions. In an embodiment, the smoothing may advantageously comprise statistical weighting, other statistical combinations, or simply passing the PI <b>422</b> through to the output, depending upon one or more of the quality signals <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b>, or logical combinations thereof. In an embodiment, the smoother <b>404</b> selects the lowest PI value to pass to the output PI <b>422</b>. This is because motion noise tends to increase PI, thus the lower PI value tends to be the more accurate value.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0035">Upon the output of a smoothed PI measurement, a monitor may advantageously audibly and/or visually presents the measurement to a caregiver, and when the measurement meets certain defined thresholds or behaviors, the monitor may advantageously audibly and/or visually alert the caregiver. In other embodiments, the monitor may communicate with other computing devices to alert the caregiver, may compare longer term trend data before alarming, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0036">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a flow chart of a smoothing process <b>500</b>, according to an embodiment of the disclosure. In block <b>502</b>, data is acquired responsive to one or more of multiple channel intensity signals. In block <b>504</b>, a determination is made whether distortion is present, whether signal quality is good, whether there is motion-induced-noise or the like. When acceptable noise levels exist, in block <b>506</b>, the baseline PI becomes the current PI and in block <b>508</b>, the baseline PI is output. However, when unacceptable signal quality or the like is detected, the current PI is compared to the baseline PI. When the current PI is smaller than the baseline PI, in block <b>506</b>, the baseline PI becomes the current PI. However, when the current PI is greater than or equal to the baseline PI, the baseline PI is output in block <b>510</b>. Thus, the smoothing process <b>500</b> determines when a baseline PI can be acquired in quality monitoring conditions, and then uses that baseline PI to avoid drift or other errors that may deteriorate the accuracy of the PI output. An artisan will recognize from the disclosure herein that the baseline PI could be reset periodically, some or all iterations, when other occurrences or measurements suggest a reinitialization, when various trends occur, or the like.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a simplified block diagram of a smoothed perfusion index generator <b>600</b>. As shown, the generator <b>600</b> includes a smoother <b>604</b> and optional indications of noise, including a measure of distortion <b>606</b>, signal quality <b>608</b>, waveform quality <b>610</b>, and Pleth Feature Extractor similar to those described with respect to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. In an embodiment, a data signal <b>620</b> responsive to an intensity signal is input into the PI Analyzer <b>602</b>, and a PI value <b>422</b> is outputted for use by the smoother <b>604</b>. In an embodiment, the PI Analyzer employs multiple different calculation techniques to determine a more accurate indication of PI. In an embodiment, based on the indications of distortion signal quality, waveform quality and/or other indications of signal quality, a specific calculation technique is used to determine a PI output value <b>622</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a simplified block diagram of an embodiment of a PI determination system <b>700</b> using multiple PI calculation techniques. As shown, pleth data <b>720</b> is input into the system. The pleth data <b>720</b> is then routed to at least two different PI calculators <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>. In an embodiment, more than two different types of calculation techniques can be used. The at least two PI calculators <b>702</b>, <b>704</b> output PI indications for input into the PI selector <b>706</b>. The PI selector <b>706</b> determines a PI value to output. In an embodiment, the PI selector chooses the lowest PI value. In general, the lower PI value should be the more accurate value, particularly in the presence of motion induced noise. This is because motion induced noise tends to raise PI values. In an embodiment, the PI selector <b>706</b> averages or otherwise analyzes the PI values using statistical modeling in order to determine a more accurate value of PI.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0039">In an embodiment, one of the PI calculators <b>702</b>, <b>704</b> determines a PI value based on pulse by pulse determination of PI, such as, for example, using the following PI formula as described above:</p>

        <figref>FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a flow chart of a PI decision process <b>800</b>, according to another embodiment of the disclosure. At block <b>802</b>, the process <b>800</b> receives pleth data <b>802</b>. The process then moves to block <b>804</b> where the process <b>800</b> calculates at least two different PI indications, such as, for example, as described with respect to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>. The process <b>800</b> then moves to block <b>806</b> where an indication of PI is determined based on the different calculations, again, such as, for example, as described with respect to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>.
