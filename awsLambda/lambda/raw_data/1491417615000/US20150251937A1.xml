      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a bacteria assisted method and an apparatus for treating water including thiosalts, such as thiosulphate and tetrathionate, and nitrogen compounds, such as nitrite, nitrate and ammonia, wherein the amount of thiosalts in the waste water is larger than the stoichiometric demand for the autotrophic nitrogen removal. The water is treated with an autotrophic denitrification process using the thiosalts as electron donor.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">PRIOR ART</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Water from mines and ore dressing plants includes large amounts of sulphur compounds, such as thiosalts, and nitrogen compounds, such as nitrite, nitrate and ammonia. If the water is discharged directly into the nature without any treatment it will cause acidification and eutrophication. Increasing demand on the removal of the thiosalts and nitrogen compounds has been raised from the authorities. Today, the thiosalts and nitrogen compounds are often removed to a minor extent by natural degradation in the large tailings ponds. However, there are examples where chemical methods, such as the Fenton process, are applied for thiosalts removal. There are also examples where the nitrogen compounds are actively removed in several steps including nitrification and denitrification using a heterotrophic bacteria culture.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Biological denitrification using bacteria cultures is a cost efficient method for nitrate and nitrite removal from most wastewater types. From an article âDenitrification by new strains of <i>thiobacillus denitrificans </i>under non-standard physicochemical conditions, effects of temperature, pH, and sulphur sourceâ, written by C. Trouve, P.M. Chazal, B. Gueroux and N. Saouvaitre, in Environmental Technology, vol. 19, pp 601 - 610, in March 1998, it is known to remove nitrates from water by means of by biological denitrification using <i>Thiobacillus denitrificans </i>as bacteria culture and using a sulphur compounds, for example thiosulphate, as an energy source. The following reaction was suggested to describe the stoichiometry when the bacteria are growing:</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]0.844 S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2â</sup>+NO<sub>3</sub><sup>â</sup>+0.347 CO<sub>2</sub>+0.0865 CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2â</sup>+0.0865 NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>+0.434 H<sub>2</sub>Oâ0.0865 C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>7</sub>O<sub>2</sub>N+0.5 N<sub>2</sub>+1.689 SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2â</sup>+0.697 H<sup>+</sup>[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0005">As seen from the above formula, carbon dioxide has to be supplied to the process. This process is carried out anaerobically.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0006">From an article âMethabolic changes of <i>Thiobacillus denitrificans </i>accompanying the transition from Aerobic to Anaerobic growth in continuous chemostate cultureâ by Pauline Justin and D. P. Kelly, in Journal of General Microbiology 107, 131 137, in March 1978, it is known that <i>Thiobacillus denitrificans </i>is capable of rapid growth on thiosulphate both aerobically and anaerobically with nitrate or nitrite as oxidant. The denitrification of nitrate is an anaerobic process and depends strongly on the oxygen concentration in the water. This is disclosed in Table 1 of the article, which exemplifies how the nitrate consumption depends on the concentration of dissolved oxygen. The table shows that the nitrate consumption ceases when the oxygen content in the water exceeds 12 Î¼M/l. The conclusion is that denitrification with thiosulphate as deoxidizing agent ceases when the oxygen content in the water exceeds a low level.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0007">In an article âCombined removal of Sulfur Compounds and Nitrate by Autotrophic Denitrification in Bioaugmented Activated Sludge Systemâ written by I. Manconi, A. Carucci, and P. Lens, published online 9 March 2007 in Wiley Inter Sience (www.interscience.wiley.com) it is proposed to simultaneously remove reduced sulfur compounds and nitrate from waste water by growth of autotrophic sulfur bacteria, such as <i>Thiobacillius Denitrificans, </i>under anaerobic conditions. The reduced sulphur compounds are used for reducing the nitrate and the nitrate is used to oxidize the reduced sulphur compounds. If the amount of sulphur compound and the amount of nitrate in the waste water corresponds to the stoichiometric demand for the nitrogen removal, it is possible to simultaneously remove the reduced sulfur compounds and the nitrate. From the reaction formula described above it is clear that the molar ratio between the amount of reduced sulphur compound and the nitrate must be at least 0,84 in order to achieve a complete removal of the sulphur compound and the nitrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0008">This is a quotation from the article: âThus, to allow maximum NO<sub>3</sub><sup>â </sup>removal without NO<sub>2</sub><sup>â </sup>accumulation, the reactor has to be operated in a nitrate limiting mode by addition of electron donor (sulfide or thiosulfate) in excess. However, a careful control of the required electron donor excess is also necessary, since both thiosulfate and sulfide have a chemical oxygen demand (COD), and because below N/S=0.6 elemental sulfur was likely formed during sulfide oxidation. Incomplete oxidation of thiosulfate or sulfide to elemental sulfur would require a separation step of the insoluble elemental sulfur from the wastewater, increasing the process complexity.â</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0009">However, in waste water from mines and ore dressing plants the amount of thiosalts in the waste water is normally significantly larger than the stoichiometric demand for the nitrogen removal. For example, the molar ratio between the thiosalts and the nitrogen compounds in the water can be in the order of 10-20. This can be compared with 0.84, which is the stoichiometric demand for nitrate removal when the culture is growing. Although the above described method can be used for complete removal the nitrate in the water, it will only remove a minor part of the thiosalts. Thus, a problem with treating this type of waste water with the above described method is that a major part of the thiosalts will still remain in the water after the treatment.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0010">One object of the present invention is to provide a method for simultaneous removal of thiosalts and nitrogen compounds in waste water where the amount of thiosalts is significantly larger than the stoichiometric demand for the nitrogen removal. This means that the molar ratio between the thiosalts and the nitrogen compounds in the waste water is significantly larger than the ration required for the denitrification process, i.e. larger than 0.84 for nitrate removal.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0011">This object is achieved with a method as defined in claim <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0012">The method comprises supplying oxygen to the water, measuring the content of dissolved oxygen in the water, and controlling the content of dissolved oxygen in the water based on the measured content of dissolved oxygen such that the excess of thiosalt is oxidized by the oxygen at the same time as the denitrification process is maintained.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0013">According to the invention, the water is treated using an autotroph culture, for example <i>Thiobacillius Denitrificans, </i>while adding oxygen to the water. A part of the thiosalts is oxidized by the nitrogen compound at the same time as the nitrogen compound is reduced to nitrogen gas by the thiosalts. The excess of thiosalts is oxidized by the added oxygen. The content of dissolved oxygen in the water is controlled so that it does not exceed the level where the denitrification process ceases. The oxygen is added to the water in such a rate that the oxygen content in the water never exceeds the content at which the denitrification ceases. This means that the oxygen is added to the water at about the same rate as it is consumed by the oxidation of the thiosalts. The oxygen can be added to the water, for example, by aeration or injection of oxygen gas. The invention makes it possible to carry out simultaneously denitrification of the nitrogen compound and oxidation of the thiosalts of waste water in which the molar ratio between the thiosalts and the nitrogen compounds is significantly larger than the ratio required for the denitrification process. Thus, an efficient removal of both nitrogen compounds and thiosalts is achieved. It has also been shown that a significant part of the ammonium content of the water is removed according to the above equation, since ammonium is the preferred nitrogen compound for biomass growth.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0014">The following advantages are achieved with the method according to the invention: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>Denitrification and oxidation of thiosalts is made in one step.</li><li>The method is environmentally friendly since is only requires supply of oxygen, a carbon dioxide source and trace elements when required. No supply of organic compounds, such as methanol, ethanol, or acetate, is needed.</li><li>The method is carried out at a neutral pH, which means that the process is less sensitive for metals, fluorine etc. compared to bacterial oxidation of thiosalts carried out at a low pH.</li><li>The method according to the invention can be used for treatment of water at temperatures down to temperatures close to 0Â° C. Thus, denitrification can be carried out efficiently at a lower temperature compared to conventional methods using organic reduction agents. This is advantageous in cold countries, such as the Nordic countries.</li><li>Low costs regarding operating economy as well as investments costs, since only one reactor is needed.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0020">The supply of oxygen to the water is controlled so that the content of dissolved oxygen in the water is kept within a certain range. According to an embodiment of the invention, the content of dissolved oxygen is controlled so that it is kept within a range of 0.3-1.5 mg/l, preferably within a range of 0.3-1 mg/l, and most preferably within a range of 0.35-0.6 mg/l.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0021">According to an embodiment of the invention, the method further comprises measuring the UV absorption in the purified water, preferable at a wave length close to the maximum UV absorption of the thiosalts and nitrogen compounds such as nitrate and nitrite, measuring the content of dissolved oxygen in the water, and controlling the supply of oxygen to the water based on the measured UV absorption and the measured oxygen content so that the measured UV absorption is minimized. To achieve a high rate of the removal of both thiosalts and nitrogen compounds, it is important that the control of the oxygen supply is optimized. If the oxygen content in the water is too low, the rate of the oxidation of the thiosalts becomes low, and if the oxygen content in the water is too high, the rate of the denitrification process becomes low. This embodiment improves the control of the oxygen supply to the water and accordingly improves the efficiency of the removal of the thiosalts and the nitrogen compounds in the water. The UV measurement is a measurement of the actual content of thiosalts and nitrogen compounds in the water. If the UV absorption is high, the content of thiosalts and/or nitrogen compounds is high. If the UV absorption is low, the content of thiosalts and/or nitrogen compounds is low. By controlling the supply of oxygen to the water such that the UV absorption of the thiosalts and nitrogen compounds is minimized, an optimal rate of removal of the thiosalts and nitrogen compounds is achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0022">According to an embodiment of the invention, the UV absorption is preferably measured at a wave length in a range of 190-225 nm. The wave length of the maximum UV absorption of thiosalts and nitrogen compounds, such as nitrate and nitrite, is about 214 nm. By on-line-measuring in an interval around 214 nm it is possible to decide whether the remaining content of thiosalts and nitrogen compounds in the purified water is minimized.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0023">According to an embodiment of the invention, the method comprises decreasing the supply of oxygen if the measured UV absorption is high and the content of oxygen is high, e.g. above a limit value, increasing the supply of oxygen if the content of oxygen is low, e.g. below a limit value, and the UV absorption is high, and otherwise maintaining the oxygen supply. By measuring the UV absorption in the purified water at a wave length close to the maximum UV absorption of the thiosalts and nitrogen compounds, it is possible to decide whether the total content of thiosalts and nitrogen compounds in the purified water is minimized. However, it is not possible to decide if it is the thiosalts or the nitrogen compounds that remains, and accordingly it is not possible to decide whether the oxygen supply is to be increased or decreased. By measuring the oxygen content and comparing it with one or more limit values, it is possible to determine whether the oxygen content is too high or too low, and accordingly determine whether the oxygen content is to be increased or decreased. If the oxygen content is too low the rate of oxidation of the thiosalts is too slow, and if the oxygen content is high, the rate of the nitrification is too slow. Thus, by adjusting the supply of oxygen to the water in that way until the absorption is minimize, the rate of removal of the thiosalts and nitrogen compounds is optimized.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0024">According to an embodiment of the invention, the waste water is fed to a bioreactor and the UV absorption at a wave length close to the maximum UV absorption of the thiosalts and nitrogen compounds is measured in the waste water fed to the reactor as well as in the purified water discharged from the reactor, and the supply of oxygen to the water is controlled in dependence of the ratio between the measured UV absorption of the feed and discharged water. This embodiment improves the measurement of the UV absorption, by minimizing the effect of changes in background UV absorption from other compounds in the solution than thiosalts and nitrogen compounds. For process control, it is preferred that the measured UV absorption is on regular basis compared to measured concentration of thiosalts and nitrogen compounds determined by standard analytical procedures.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0025">According to an embodiment of the invention, the method comprises measuring the pH value in the water and supplying a suitable pH regulator to the water to maintain the pH within a range 6-8, and preferably in the range of 6.5-7.5. To avoid further acidification downstream in case of residual thiosalts and nitrogen compounds, the additional pH regulators such as sodium carbonate may be added to buffer the water before the purified water is discharged into the nature.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0026">According to another embodiment of the invention, the autotrophic denitrification process is carried out by a <i>Thiobacillius Denitrificans </i>strain. Preferably, the autotrophic denitrification process is carried out by a psychrophilic or psychrotolerant strain of <i>Thiobacillius Denitrificans. Thiobacillius Denitrificans </i>has been proven to be very suitable to carry out this process since it is active close to 0Â° C., producing biofilm and active sludge. Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for simultaneous removal of thiosalts and nitrogen compounds in waste water where the amount of thiosalts is larger than the stoichiometric demand for the nitrogen removal.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0027">This object is achieved with an apparatus as defined in claim <b>9</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0028">The apparatus comprises a bioreactor including an autotrophic bacteria culture carrying out a denitrification process using the thiosalts as electron donors, having an inlet for receiving the waste water, and an outlet for discharging the purified water. The apparatus further comprises an oxygen supply device arranged to supply oxygen to the water in the reactor, a device for measuring the content of dissolved oxygen in the water, and a control unit arranged to control the content of dissolved oxygen in the reactor based on the measured content of dissolved oxygen such that the excess of thiosalts is oxidized by the oxygen at the same time as the denitrification process is maintained.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0029">According to an embodiment of the invention, the apparatus further comprises a device for measuring the content of dissolved oxygen in the reactor and a spectrometer arranged to measure the UV absorption in the purified water at a wave length close to the maximum UV absorption of the thiosalts and nitrogen compounds, and the control unit is arranged to control the supply of oxygen to the water based on the measured UV absorption and the measured oxygen content so that the measured UV absorption is minimized.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0030">According to an embodiment of the invention, the control unit is arranged to control the supply of oxygen to the reactor by decreasing the supply of oxygen if the measured UV absorption is high and the content of dissolved oxygen is above a limit value, and increasing the supply of oxygen if the UV absorption is high and the content of dissolved oxygen is below a limit value, and maintaining the present supply of oxygen if the measured UV absorption is low.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0031">According to an embodiment of the invention, the apparatus comprises devices to retain the biomass, e.g. biofilm carriers or/and downstream facilities to recover and recycle the biomass.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0032">The present invention also relates to the use of the method according to the invention and the apparatus according to the invention for treating waste water from mines and ore dressing plants. The invention is particularly suitable for treatment of waste water from mines and ore dressing plants since the amount of thiosalts usually is significantly larger than the stoichiometric demand for the nitrogen removal in waste water from mines and ore dressing plants.</p>

      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0037">The waste water is added to a reactor including an autotroph bacteria culture capable of carrying out a denitrification process.

An advantage with supplying carbonate is that besides the neutralizing effect, it becomes a carbon dioxide source for maintaining the reaction described in formula 1 above.

However, the content of dissolved oxygen which leads to the ceasing of the denitrification process may vary due to the water content and other conditions such as the reactor design with respect to fluid dynamics etc. Preferably, the content of dissolved oxygen which leads to ceasing of the denitrification process is determined for the current water by experiments and optimization.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of an apparatus for simultaneous removal of thiosalts and nitrogen compounds in waste water according to the invention. The apparatus includes a reactor <b>1</b> in the form of a vessel including an autotrophic bacteria culture capable of carrying out a denitrification process using thiosalts as electron donors. In this embodiment of the invention, the reactor is a moving bed bio reactor (MBBR) which includes biofilm carriers <b>5</b>. By usage of the MBBR technique, only one reactor is needed.</p>

The UV measurement is a measurement of the actual content of thiosalts and nitrogen compounds in the water. If the UV absorption is high, the content of thiosalts and/or nitrogen compounds is high.

      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0056">However, since both nitrate and thiosulphate have a peak at about 214 nm it is not possible to decide from the UV measurements which one of the thiosalts and nitrogen compounds remains, and accordingly it is not possible to decide whether the oxygen supply is to be increased or decreased. In order to be able to decide whether the oxygen supply is to be increased or decreased the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water is measured. By comparing the measured oxygen content with a limit value, it is possible to determine whether the oxygen content is too high or too low, and accordingly to determine whether the oxygen content is to be increased or decreased. If the oxygen content is too low the rate of oxidation of the thiosalts is too slow, and if the oxygen content is high, the rate of the nitrification is too slow.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0057">The control unit <b>10</b> is arranged to control the supply of oxygen to the reactor by decreasing the supply of oxygen if the measured UV absorption is high, i.e. above a first limit value, and the measured content of dissolved oxygen is above a second limit value, and increasing the supply of oxygen if the UV absorption is high and the content of dissolved oxygen is below the second limit value, and maintaining the present supply of oxygen if the measured UV absorption is low, i.e. below the first limit value.

The control of the oxygen supply is, for example, done by setting a desired value for the UV absorption as a control point for the UV regulator. The content of dissolved oxygen in the reactor becomes an operating range for the UV controller, in which the UV controller searches for an optimal oxygen supply. The oxygen supply is reduced if the oxygen content in the water is high, and the oxygen supply is increased if the oxygen content in the water is low. Thus, the oxygen supply is tuned within the operating range in dependence on the UV response.</p>

This improves the measurement of the UV absorption, by minimizing the effect of changes in background UV absorption from other compounds in the solution than thiosalts and nitrogen compounds. For process control, it is preferred that the measured UV absorption is on regular basis compared to measured concentration of thiosalts and nitrogen compounds determined by standard analytical procedures.</p>
