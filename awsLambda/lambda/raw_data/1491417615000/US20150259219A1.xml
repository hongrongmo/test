The example embodiments described herein are not meant to be limiting. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, separated, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Furthermore, the particular arrangements shown in the Figures should not be viewed as limiting. It should be understood that other embodiments may include more or less of each element shown in a given Figure. Further, some of the illustrated elements may be combined or omitted. Yet further, an example embodiment may include elements that are not illustrated in the Figures.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">As used herein, with respect to measurements, âaboutâ means+/â5%.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">As used herein, âlongitudinal axisâ is an axis along the lengthwise direction of a given component, passing through the center of the component.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The present disclosure provides various filtration devices for separating waste particles from a stream of liquid. The filtration devices described herein allow for cross-flow filtration as one mode of filtration, and cyclonic filtration as a further mode of filtration. In particular, an example filtration device may use a combination of cross-flow filtration and cyclonic filtration, and may adjust various parameters of the filtration device to achieve a desired form of filtration. As such, the described devices and methods may be used in a variety of water treatment, fluid filtering and particle separation applications.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">With reference to the Figures, <figref>FIGS. 1A-1C</figref> illustrate a filtration device <b>100</b> according to an example embodiment. In particular, <figref>FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of an example filtration device <b>100</b>. As seen in <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>, the filtration device <b>100</b> includes a plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b>. The filtration device <b>100</b> further includes a spine <b>104</b> connected to each of the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b>. Each of the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b> are positioned at an angle with respect to a longitudinal axis of the spine <b>106</b>. In one example, the spine <b>104</b> is connected to a center of each of the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b>. As such, each of the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b> are parallel to one another as positioned on the spine <b>104</b>. The angle of each of the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b> with respect to the longitudinal axis of the spine <b>106</b> is less than about 45 degrees, although other angles are possible as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The filtration device <b>100</b> further includes a terminal lobe <b>108</b> including a surface positioned substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the spine <b>106</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, each of the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b> are angled towards the terminal lobe <b>108</b>. In particular, a distal end <b>110</b> of each of the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b> is closer to the terminal lobe <b>108</b> than a proximal end <b>112</b> of each of the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b>. The surface of the terminal lobe <b>108</b> may be substantially planar and may have a width approximately equivalent to a width of each of the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b>. In addition, a plurality of pores <b>114</b> may be positioned at the distal end <b>110</b> of each of the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b>. The plurality of pores <b>114</b> may be in fluid communication with a waste channel <b>116</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>, the waste channel <b>116</b> may be disposed within the spine <b>104</b> of the filtration device <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">
        <figref>FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the filtration device <b>100</b> of <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>, the filtration device <b>100</b> may further include a plurality of projections <b>118</b> extending from the proximal end <b>112</b> of the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b>. The plurality of projections <b>118</b> may be evenly spaced along the proximal end <b>112</b> of the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b>. <figref>FIG. 1C</figref> illustrates a back view of the filtration device <b>100</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>, further illustrating the plurality of projections <b>118</b> extending from the proximal end of one of the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In operation, the filtration device <b>100</b> may be positioned within a flow chamber, such as a pipe or other such configuration. In one example, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 2A-2B</figref>, the filtration device <b>100</b> may be positioned such that the longitudinal axis of the spine <b>106</b> is positioned substantially parallel to a direction of fluid flow <b>122</b> through the filtration device <b>100</b>. Further, the filtration device <b>100</b> may be positioned in two ways with respect to the direction of fluid flow <b>122</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In a first embodiment, shown in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, the filtration device <b>100</b> is positioned such that the terminal lobe <b>108</b> is positioned upstream in relation to the direction of fluid flow <b>122</b>. In such an embodiment, flow across the filtration device <b>100</b> is turbulent, which is more conducive to cyclonic filtration. In cyclonic filtration, a vortex is created within the pore <b>114</b> of the filter lobe <b>102</b>. The vortex within the pore <b>114</b> entrains particles smaller than the pore size. Such a configuration may be advantageous when the liquid being filtered includes small waste particles that should be filtered out of the liquid. The addition of cyclonic filtration may help capture such small particles more effectively than cross-flow filtration alone. As such particles are captured in the pores <b>114</b> of the filter lobes <b>102</b>, the particles are transported out of the fluid flow <b>122</b> through the waste channel <b>116</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In a second embodiment, shown in <figref>FIG. 2B</figref>, the filtration device <b>100</b> is positioned such that the terminal lobe <b>108</b> is positioned downstream in relation to the direction of fluid flow <b>122</b>. In such an embodiment, flow across the filtration device <b>100</b> is laminar, which is more conducive to cross-flow filtration. Laminar flow and cross-flow filtration may be advantageous when the liquid being filtered includes larger waste particles that should be filtered out of the liquid. In general, laminar flow means than the flow rate of the liquid is less than in turbulent flow. The lower flow rate may be advantageous in filtering larger particles to prevent or minimize damage to the filter lobes <b>102</b> and other components of the filtration device <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the filtration device <b>100</b> positioned with an angle between the longitudinal axis of the spine <b>106</b> and the direction of fluid flow <b>122</b>. In one example, the angle may be between 0 degrees (parallel to the direction of fluid flow <b>122</b>) and 60 degrees. Cyclonic flow may be induced at approximately 40 degrees, although a greater angle may provide more defined cyclonic flow. <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates an example embodiment in which the angle between the longitudinal axis of the spine <b>106</b> and the direction of fluid flow <b>122</b> is about 40 degrees. In contrast, <figref>FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates an example embodiment in which the angle between the longitudinal axis of the spine <b>106</b> and the direction of fluid flow <b>122</b> is about 60 degrees. In <figref>FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>, the terminal lobe <b>108</b> is positioned upstream with respect to the direction of fluid flow <b>122</b>. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>, as the angle between the longitudinal axis of the spine <b>106</b> and the direction of fluid flow <b>122</b> increases, flow at the pore <b>114</b> of the filter lobes <b>102</b> is more organized and increasingly cyclonic in nature.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In some examples, the filtration device <b>100</b> may be adjustable such that the angle between the longitudinal axis of the spine <b>106</b> and the direction of fluid flow <b>122</b> can be changed during operation. In one example, the filtration device <b>100</b> may include a motor connected to the spine <b>104</b>, where the motor is configured to adjust the angle between the longitudinal axis of the spine <b>106</b> and a direction of fluid flow <b>122</b> through the filtration device <b>100</b>. Such a motor may be an electric motor powered by electrical power, or may be powered by a number of different energy sources, such as a gas-based fuel or solar power. In another example, the filtration device may include an actuator coupled to the spine <b>104</b>, where the actuator is configured to adjust an angle between the longitudinal axis of the spine <b>106</b> and a direction of fluid flow <b>122</b> through the filtration device <b>100</b>. Such an actuator may be an electro-mechanical actuator, including an electric motor configured to convert a rotary motion of the electric motor to a linear displacement. Other potential actuators are possible as well, such as hydraulic actuators, pneumatic actuators, piezoelectric actuators, linear motors, or telescoping linear actuators, as examples.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In addition, the filtration device <b>100</b> may include a controller (e.g., a microprocessor, FPGA, microcontroller, or the like) configured to adjust the angle between the longitudinal axis of the spine <b>106</b> and the direction of fluid flow <b>122</b>. In one example, the filtration device <b>100</b> may further include a spectrometer configured to measure a size of particles present in the liquid, and transmit the determined particle size to the controller. The controller may then cause the motor and/or actuator to automatically adjust the angle between the longitudinal axis of the spine <b>106</b> and the direction of fluid flow <b>122</b> based on the determined particle size. In another example, the angle between the longitudinal axis of the spine <b>106</b> and the direction of fluid flow <b>122</b> may be adjusted manually via human input at a user interface. Other examples are possible as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In addition to changing the angle between the longitudinal axis of the spine <b>106</b> and the direction of fluid flow <b>122</b>, the filtration device <b>100</b> may include other features that alter the flow of the liquid through the filtration device. As discussed above in relation to <figref>FIGS. 1B-1C</figref>, the filtration device <b>100</b> may include a plurality of projections <b>118</b> extending from the proximal end <b>112</b> of the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b>. In other embodiments, the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b> may include other secondary surface structures instead of or in addition to the plurality of projections <b>118</b>. In particular, <figref>FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> illustrate different secondary surface structures that may be present on the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b>. <figref>FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates a top view of a plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b> including a plurality of projections <b>118</b>, such as the projections <b>118</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 1B-1C</figref>. <figref>FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates a top view of a plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b> including a plurality of protrusions <b>120</b> positioned on a surface of each of the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b>.

      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 6A-6F</figref>, when the terminal lobe <b>108</b> is positioned downstream in relation to the direction of fluid flow <b>122</b>, tangential shearing is distinct and the fluid flow is less turbulent. In contrast, when the terminal lobe <b>108</b> is positioned upstream in relation to the direction of fluid flow <b>122</b>, tangential shearing is more turbulent and less organized. Further, the plurality of projections <b>118</b> increase the surface area of the plurality of filter lobes <b>102</b>, thereby decreasing the flow rate of the fluid.
