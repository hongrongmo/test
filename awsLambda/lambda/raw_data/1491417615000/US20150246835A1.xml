    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">Disclosed is an air diffusion device including a base coupled to an air supply pipe and having an air discharge hole for discharge of air supplied from the air supply pipe, a perforated cover having a single-layered flat plate shape, and a securing mechanism to secure the perforated cover to the base. The perforated cover having through-holes is coupled to an upper surface of the base to cover the air discharge hole, defining an air guide chamber between the perforated cover and the base. The air diffusion device has ease in assembly/disassembly thereof because the perforated cover is assembled to the base via the securing mechanism separably coupled to the base. Further, through provision of a diaphragm cover to open or close an air discharge hole for discharge of air into the air guide chamber, it is possible to prevent wastewater, sludge, or impurities from entering the air supply pipe.</p>

      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to an air diffusion device for efficiently supplying air and other gases in a process that requires dissolved oxygen, and more particularly, to an improved air diffusion device capable of ensuring easy assembly and enhanced aeration efficiency.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Due to continuous industrialization and urbanization, environmental contamination is worsening and kinds of wastewater, dirty water, and sewage are also diversified. Facilities for treatment thereof are being advanced and treatment cost is increasing.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Currently, biological treatment methods, which are selectively combined with physical and chemical methods, are mainly used for wastewater treatment. These biological treatment methods may basically be classified into two kinds, i.e. an aerotropic treatment method and an anaerobic treatment method.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Anaerobic treatment advantageously does not require the supply of oxygen and achieves the acquisition of combustible methane gas as an energy source, but has disadvantages, such as long reaction duration, generation of bad odor, and the like. Most wastewater treatment facilities employ aerotropic treatment owing to advantages, such as short reaction duration, perfect removal of organic materials, and the like, although aerotropic treatment disadvantageously requires energy consumption for the supply of oxygen, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In aerotropic treatment, the supply of oxygen is essential to the growth and activity of aerotropic microorganisms. To this end, an air diffusion device is used. The air diffusion device is installed in an aeration tank (reactor), and serves to maintain an appropriate amount of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) in the aeration tank. Gas is dispersed in wastewater in the aeration tank, and therefore a bubble size, bubble hold-up, contact between gas and liquid, and flow characteristics of gas and liquid have a great effect on operational conditions, performance, efficiency, and the like of the aeration tank.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">An efficient method for increasing a contact area between gas and liquid in an aeration tank and increasing a mass transfer coefficient between gas and liquid is to increase bubble hold-up. To this end, uniform generation of bubbles having a reduced size is essential. During rising, bubbles are increased in size while coalesced in the aeration tank. This is because a bubble rising velocity increases in proportion to a bubble size, and therefore increase in the size of bubbles reduces a bubble hold-up period. In a case in which bubbles have a large size and generation of bubbles is not uniform, the bubbles will have a short hold-up period in the aeration tank, which causes deterioration of Standard Oxygen Transfer Efficiency (SOTE).</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Various shapes of air diffusion devices, such as a pipe-shaped air diffusion device, a ball-shaped air diffusion device, a disc-shaped air diffusion device, and the like, have been developed and used. In addition, a multistage disc-shaped air diffusion device, in which a plurality of discs is arranged in multiple stages to increase the supply amount of air, has been supposed.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Various kinds of air diffusion devices are disclosed in Korean Registered Patent Publications No. 1198379 (22 Aug. 2012), No. 1198378 (20 Aug. 2012), No. 1010579 (25 Jun. 2010), and No. 1128977 (22 Jun. 2011), and Korean Registered Utility Model Publication No. 0368391 (11 Nov. 2004), and the like. At present, various shapes of air diffusion devices have been developed and applied to a variety of water treatment facilities, and various research to enhance aeration efficiency and to reduce manufacturing cost have been conducted.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above description, and it is an object of the present invention to provide an air diffusion device having an improved configuration to ensure easy assembly and enhanced aeration efficiency based on uniform aeration.</p>

      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In the following description of the present invention, the size, shape or the like of constituent elements illustrated in the drawings may be exaggerated or schematically illustrated for clarity and convenience of explanation. Also, the terms particularly defined taking into consideration the configurations and operations of the present invention may be changed based on intentions of users or operators and customs. These terms should be constructed as meanings and concepts conforming to the technical sprit of the present invention based on the general context of this specification.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">As exemplarily shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, the air diffusion device, designated by reference numeral <b>10</b>, according to a first embodiment of the present invention includes a base <b>11</b> coupled to an air supply pipe <b>5</b> that is used to supply air, a perforated cover <b>13</b> coupled to the top of the base <b>11</b> to define an air guide chamber <b>12</b> between the base <b>11</b> and the perforated cover <b>13</b>, and a securing mechanism <b>14</b> configured to secure the perforated cover <b>13</b> to the base <b>11</b>. A sealing member <b>15</b> is interposed between the base <b>11</b> and the perforated cover <b>13</b> to seal a gap therebetween.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">A pipe connector <b>16</b>, to which the air supply pipe <b>5</b> is coupled, is formed at a lower surface of the base <b>11</b>. The pipe connector <b>16</b> may be provided with male screw threads to allow the pipe connector <b>16</b> to be fastened to the air supply pipe <b>5</b> via screwing. Naturally, a coupling configuration between the air supply pipe <b>5</b> and the pipe connector <b>16</b> may be altered into other configurations except for the screwing configuration. The pipe connector <b>16</b> may have an inner flow path. When air, supplied from the air supply pipe <b>5</b>, passes through the inner flow path of the pipe connector <b>16</b>, the air may be introduced into the air guide chamber <b>12</b> through an air supply port <b>17</b> formed in the bottom of the base <b>11</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">A check valve <b>18</b> is installed in the pipe connector <b>16</b>. The check valve <b>18</b> permits passage of air moving from the air supply pipe <b>5</b> to the air supply port <b>17</b> and interrupts movement of air, water, impurities, or the like from the air supply port <b>17</b> to the air supply pipe <b>5</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">An air guide mechanism <b>19</b> is fitted into the air supply port <b>17</b> and serves to guide air to the top of the air guide chamber <b>12</b>. The air guide mechanism <b>19</b> takes the form of a tubular structure internally defining a flow path for movement of air. The air guide mechanism <b>19</b> is provided at an upper end thereof with an air discharge hole <b>20</b> from which air moved through the flow path is discharged into the air guide chamber <b>12</b>. Although the air guide mechanism <b>19</b> is illustrated in the drawing as being fastened to the base <b>11</b> via screwing, a coupling configuration of the air guide mechanism <b>19</b> may be altered into other configurations except for the screwing configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The base <b>11</b> includes a cover bonding portion <b>21</b> provided at an upper edge thereof, the cover bonding portion <b>21</b> coming into close contact with the perforated cover <b>13</b>. A receiving groove <b>22</b> for reception of the sealing member <b>15</b> is indented in the cover bonding portion <b>21</b>. In addition, the base <b>11</b> further includes a plurality of securing projections <b>23</b>, which protrude outward from the outer periphery of the base <b>11</b>. The securing projections <b>23</b> serve to couple the base <b>11</b> to the securing mechanism <b>14</b>. A coupling bump <b>24</b> protrudes downward from a lower surface of each securing projection <b>23</b>. The securing projection <b>23</b> is further provided at one end thereof with a slope <b>25</b> that is downwardly inclined from a distal end to the center of the securing projection <b>23</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">A plurality of reinforcement ribs <b>26</b> and an impurity removal mechanism <b>27</b> are formed at the lower surface of the base <b>11</b>. The impurity removal mechanism <b>27</b> serves to discharge impurities (designated by reference character S in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>) introduced into the air guide chamber <b>12</b> to the outside of the air guide chamber <b>12</b>. Impurities S contained in water may be introduced into the air guide chamber <b>12</b> through a plurality of through-holes <b>42</b> of the perforated cover <b>13</b>, the through-holes <b>42</b> serving to disperse air introduced into the air guide chamber <b>12</b> into the water. Removal of the impurities S is desirable because the impurities S accumulated in the air guide chamber <b>12</b> cause deterioration in the air supply efficiency of the air diffusion device <b>10</b>. The impurity removal mechanism <b>27</b> discharges the impurities S accumulated in the air guide chamber <b>12</b>, thereby preventing deterioration in the air supply efficiency of the air diffusion device <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The impurity removal mechanism <b>27</b> includes an impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> coupled to the base <b>11</b>, an opening/closing member <b>29</b> movably installed in the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b>, a spring <b>30</b> adapted to apply elastic force to the opening/closing member <b>29</b>, and a spring support structure <b>31</b> movably inserted into the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> to adjust the elastic force of the spring <b>30</b>. The impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> has an impurity inlet <b>32</b> connected to the air guide chamber <b>12</b> to allow the impurities S accumulated in the air guide chamber <b>12</b> to be introduced into the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b>, and an impurity outlet <b>33</b> connected to an impurity discharge pipe <b>34</b> that is used to guide the impurities S to the outside. The impurity inlet <b>32</b> is formed at one end of the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> and the impurity outlet <b>33</b> is formed at a lateral side of the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b>. When the impurities S are introduced through the impurity inlet <b>32</b>, the impurities S move through an inner flow path of the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> and are discharged outward through the impurity outlet <b>33</b> and the impurity discharge pipe <b>34</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">A seat <b>35</b> having an orifice <b>36</b> is interposed between the impurity inlet <b>32</b> and the impurity outlet <b>33</b> within the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b>. The opening/closing member <b>29</b> is adapted to come into close contact with the seat <b>35</b> or to be spaced apart from the seat <b>35</b> while moving in the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b>. The orifice <b>36</b> is closed and hermetically sealed when the opening/closing member <b>29</b> comes into close contact with the seat <b>35</b>, and is open when the opening/closing member <b>29</b> is spaced apart from the seat <b>35</b>. The spring <b>30</b> applies elastic force to the opening/closing member <b>29</b> in a given direction to assist the opening/closing member <b>29</b> in coming into close contact with the seat <b>35</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The spring support structure <b>31</b> includes a spring support member <b>37</b> configured to support the spring <b>30</b> in contact with the spring <b>30</b>, and an adjustor knob <b>38</b> coupled to one end of the spring support member <b>37</b>. The spring support structure <b>31</b> is movably located in a region of the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> below the impurity outlet <b>33</b>. The spring support member <b>37</b> has male screw threads corresponding to female screw threads formed at the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b>, and is fastened to the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> via screwing.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">A distal end of the adjustor knob <b>38</b> protrudes outward of the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> through an open lower end of the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b>. The spring support member <b>37</b> may be vertically moved as a user rotates the spring support member <b>37</b> by operating the adjustor knob <b>38</b>. The spring <b>30</b> comes into contact at one end thereof with the opening/closing member <b>29</b> and at the other end thereof with the spring support member <b>37</b>. As such, the spring <b>30</b> is compressed to thereby exert increased elastic force when the spring support member <b>37</b> is raised, and is stretched to thereby exert reduced elastic force when the spring support member <b>37</b> is lowered. In this way, the user may adjust the elastic force of the spring <b>30</b> by operating the adjustor knob <b>38</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">To prevent the spring support structure <b>31</b> from being separated from the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> upon receiving the elastic force of the spring <b>30</b>, a spring support structure fixing member <b>39</b> is coupled to the distal end of the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b>. The spring support structure fixing member <b>39</b> has a knob coupling hole <b>40</b> for insertion of the adjustor knob <b>38</b>. The spring support structure fixing member <b>39</b> is fitted to the distal end of the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> in a state in which the adjustor knob <b>38</b> is inserted into the knob coupling hole <b>40</b>, which may prevent rotation of the adjustor knob <b>38</b>. In addition to being press-fitted into the distal end of the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> as exemplarily shown, the spring support structure fixing member <b>39</b> may be altered into other configurations in which it is coupled to the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> to prevent rotation of the spring support structure <b>31</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As exemplarily shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, when the internal pressure of the air guide chamber <b>12</b> is less than the elastic force of the spring <b>30</b>, the opening/closing member <b>29</b> is moved to come into close contact with the seat <b>35</b> to close and hermetically seal the orifice <b>36</b>, and thus air within the air guide chamber <b>12</b> is not discharged through the impurity removal mechanism <b>27</b>. On the other hand, as exemplarily shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, when the impurities S are introduced into the air guide chamber <b>12</b> and the internal pressure of the air guide chamber <b>12</b> becomes greater than the elastic force of the spring <b>30</b>, the opening/closing member <b>29</b> compresses the spring <b>30</b> and is spaced apart from the seat <b>35</b> to open the orifice <b>36</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Then, when the opening/closing member <b>29</b>, spaced apart from the seat <b>35</b>, is moved to a position lower than the impurity outlet <b>33</b>, the impurities S introduced through the impurity inlet <b>32</b> are discharged outward through the impurity outlet <b>33</b> by way of the orifice <b>36</b>. Then, when the pressure of the air guide chamber <b>12</b> again becomes less than the elastic force of the spring <b>30</b> as the impurities S are discharged from the air guide chamber <b>12</b>, the opening/closing member <b>29</b> is moved, by elastic force of the spring <b>30</b>, to come into close contact with the seat <b>35</b>, thereby closing the orifice <b>36</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Although the base <b>11</b> is illustrated as having a cylindrical shape in the drawing, the shape of the base <b>11</b> is not limited to the illustration and may be altered in various ways. In one example, assuming that the base <b>11</b> is gradually reduced in width and height from the edge to the center thereof, the impurities S introduced into the air guide chamber <b>12</b> may gather at the center of the base <b>11</b>. Moreover, when the impurity removal mechanism <b>27</b> is installed at a relatively low position, i.e. near the center of the base <b>11</b>, removal efficiency of the impurities S may be enhanced. In another example, the base <b>11</b> may be gradually reduced in height from the center to the edge thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">As exemplarily shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, the perforated cover <b>13</b> is coupled to an upper surface of the base <b>11</b> to cover a top opening of the base <b>11</b>. The perforated cover <b>13</b> takes the form of a single layered flat plate, and has the through-holes <b>42</b> for air discharge. The perforated cover <b>13</b> includes a base bonding portion <b>43</b> provided at a lower edge thereof, the base bonding portion <b>43</b> coming into close contact with the cover bonding portion <b>21</b>. A receiving groove <b>44</b> for reception of the sealing member <b>15</b> is indented in the base bonding portion <b>43</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The through-holes <b>42</b> may be arranged in the entire perforated cover <b>13</b> or may be arranged in a portion of the perforated cover <b>13</b>, to discharge air, introduced into the air guide chamber <b>12</b>, upward of the perforated cover <b>13</b>. The perforated cover <b>13</b> has a non-perforated portion <b>45</b> having no through-hole <b>42</b>. The non-perforated portion <b>45</b> may be a linear or circular portion extending from the center to the edge of the perforated cover <b>13</b>. The through-holes <b>42</b> of the perforated cover <b>13</b> may reduce the rigidity of the perforated cover <b>13</b>. Thus, the non-perforated portion <b>45</b> having no through-hole <b>42</b> has a greater rigidity than the portion of the perforated cover <b>13</b> having the through-holes <b>42</b>. Thus, when providing the perforated cover <b>13</b> with a plurality of non-perforated portions <b>45</b>, the non-perforated portions <b>45</b> serve as reinforcement portions to increase rigidity of the perforated cover <b>13</b>, which may reduce damage to the perforated cover <b>13</b>. Although the non-perforated portions <b>45</b> are illustrated as having a crisscross arrangement or concentric arrangement in the drawing, the shape or arrangement of the non-perforated portions <b>45</b> may be altered in various ways.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The through-holes <b>42</b> are gradually reduced in size from an inner surface to an outer surface of the perforated cover <b>13</b>. Through provision of the tapered through-holes <b>42</b>, it is possible to reduce the size of bubbles to be discharged outward through the through-holes <b>42</b>. In addition, the through-holes <b>42</b> may be arranged in such a manner that a distance between the through-holes <b>42</b> increases from the edge to the center of the perforated cover <b>13</b>. That is, a distance between the through-holes <b>42</b> in a peripheral region of the perforated cover <b>13</b> is relatively small, and a distance between the through-holes <b>42</b> in a central region of the perforated cover <b>13</b> is relatively large. This gradually increasing distance between the through-holes <b>42</b> from the edge to the center of the perforated cover <b>13</b> may cause bubbles discharged through the through-holes <b>42</b> to gather at the center of water, which may reduce generation of coarse bubbles.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The perforated cover <b>13</b> described above may be simply fabricated at low cost by molding a metal plate and perforating the through-holes <b>42</b>. Naturally, the perforated cover <b>13</b> may be formed of various materials, such as composites, reinforced plastics, or the like, rather than the metal plate.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The perforated cover <b>13</b> is first put on the base <b>11</b> such that the base bonding portion <b>43</b> of the perforated cover <b>13</b> is bonded to the cover bonding portion <b>21</b> of the base <b>11</b>, and thereafter is secured to the base <b>11</b> using the securing mechanism <b>14</b>. The securing mechanism <b>14</b> includes a securing ring <b>47</b> coupled to an upper edge of the base <b>11</b> so as to cover the upper edge of the base <b>11</b> and the lower edge of the perforated cover <b>13</b>, a cover pressure portion <b>48</b> protruding downward from the securing ring <b>47</b>, and a plurality of pressure members <b>49</b> arranged at an inner periphery of the securing ring <b>47</b>. A plurality of anti-slip portions <b>50</b> is arranged at an outer periphery of the securing ring <b>47</b>. The anti-slip portions <b>50</b> serve to prevent slippage of the user's hand when the user couples the securing ring <b>47</b> to the base <b>11</b>. The number of the pressure members <b>49</b> is equal to the number of the securing projections <b>23</b> formed at the base <b>11</b> and is arranged at the securing ring <b>47</b> at the same distance as that of the securing projections <b>23</b>. A coupling recess <b>51</b> is indented in the center of an upper surface of each pressure member <b>49</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">After the perforated cover <b>13</b> is placed on the upper surface of the base <b>11</b>, the securing ring <b>47</b> is coupled to the upper edge of the base <b>11</b> so as to cover both the upper edge of the base <b>11</b> and the lower edge of the perforated cover <b>13</b>. Then, when the securing ring <b>47</b> is turned by a given angle, the upper surface of each pressure member <b>49</b> slides on the slope <b>25</b> of the corresponding securing projection <b>23</b>, thereby coming into close contact with the lower surface of the securing projection <b>23</b>. In this case, the coupling bump <b>24</b> of the securing projection <b>23</b> is inserted into the coupling recess <b>51</b> of the pressure member <b>49</b>, and the cover pressure portion <b>48</b> of the securing ring <b>47</b> pushes the lower edge of the perforated cover <b>13</b> to the upper edge of the base <b>11</b>. As such, the securing projection <b>23</b> and the pressure member <b>49</b> are stably kept in a close contact state, and the perforated cover <b>13</b> is firmly secured to the base <b>11</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a sectional view showing an air diffusion device according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The air diffusion device, designated by reference numeral <b>55</b>, as exemplarily shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref> has substantially the same configuration as the above described air diffusion device <b>10</b>, except for an altered coupling configuration of the air guide mechanism <b>19</b> with respect to the air supply port <b>17</b> of the base <b>11</b>. As exemplarily shown in <figref>FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the air guide mechanism <b>19</b> includes an air guide pipe <b>56</b> having a head <b>57</b> provided with the air discharge hole <b>20</b>, from which air, supplied through the air supply port <b>17</b>, is discharged into the air guide chamber <b>12</b>, and a diaphragm cover <b>58</b> engaged with the head <b>57</b> and coming into close contact with an upper surface of the head <b>57</b> to cover the air discharge hole <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The head <b>57</b> is further provided around the air discharge hole <b>20</b> with a plurality of air guide holes <b>59</b>. The air guide holes <b>59</b> serve to guide the air, discharged through the air discharge hole <b>20</b>, into the air guide chamber <b>12</b>. Additional air guide holes <b>59</b> to guide air into the air guide chamber <b>12</b> are also perforated in the diaphragm cover <b>58</b> so as not to overlap the air discharge hole <b>20</b> or the air guide holes <b>59</b> of the head <b>57</b>. A plug <b>60</b> is formed at a lower surface of the diagram cover <b>58</b> to protrude to the air discharge hole <b>20</b>. Thus, the plug <b>60</b> is inserted into the air discharge hole <b>20</b> to close the air discharge hole <b>20</b>. The diaphragm cover <b>58</b> is formed of an elastically deformable material, such as rubber, silicon, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">As exemplarily shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, while air is not supplied through the air supply pipe <b>5</b>, the diaphragm cover <b>58</b> comes into close contact with the head <b>57</b> of the air guide pipe <b>56</b> to close the air discharge hole <b>20</b>, thereby preventing air, water, impurities, or the like within the air guide chamber <b>12</b> from moving backward to the air supply pipe <b>5</b> through the air discharge hole <b>20</b>. Conversely, as exemplarily shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, when air is supplied through the air supply pipe <b>5</b>, the diaphragm cover <b>58</b> is elastically deformed by pressure of the air such that a central portion thereof is lifted and spaced apart from the head <b>57</b>. In this case, the air, discharged through the air discharge hole <b>20</b> of the air guide pipe <b>56</b>, moves along a gap between the head <b>57</b> and the diaphragm cover <b>58</b> and is discharged into the air guide chamber <b>12</b> through the air guide holes <b>59</b> of the head <b>57</b> and the air guide holes <b>59</b> of the diaphragm cover <b>58</b>. Then, when the supply of air through the air supply pipe <b>5</b> stops, the diaphragm cover <b>58</b> is elastically restored to an original state thereof and comes into close contact with the head <b>57</b> to close the air discharge hole <b>20</b>, thereby preventing air, water, or impurities from moving backward through the air discharge hole <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In this way, through provision of the air guide mechanism <b>19</b> having the diaphragm cover <b>58</b>, the air diffusion device <b>55</b> according to the second embodiment of the present invention may prevent air, water, impurities, and the like from moving backward to the air supply pipe <b>5</b> while supplying air into the air guide chamber <b>12</b>, without installation of a check valve.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">
        <figref>FIG. 9</figref> illustrates another alternative embodiment of the air guide mechanism.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The air guide mechanism <b>19</b>, exemplarily shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, has substantially the same configuration as the above described air guide mechanism <b>19</b> as exemplarily shown in <figref>FIGS. 6 to 8</figref>, except for an orientation of the air guide holes <b>59</b> perforated in the head <b>57</b> of the air guide pipe <b>56</b>. The air guide holes <b>59</b> of the head <b>57</b> are tilted in a direction opposite to a direction in which the air guide pipe <b>56</b> is turned for screwing insertion into the air supply port <b>17</b>. Thus, as air is discharged through the air guide holes <b>59</b> of the head <b>57</b> in a direction opposite to a direction in which the air guide pipe <b>56</b> is turned for screwing insertion into the air supply port <b>17</b>, the air applies force to the air guide pipe <b>56</b> in a tightening direction thereof. In turn, as the air discharged through the air guide holes <b>59</b> of the head <b>57</b> applies force to the air guide pipe <b>56</b> in a tightening direction thereof, it is possible to prevent the air guide pipe <b>56</b> from being unintentionally released from the air supply port <b>17</b> due to force caused by air discharge.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 10</figref> is a sectional view showing an air diffusion device according to a third embodiment of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The air diffusion device, designated by reference numeral <b>65</b>, exemplarily shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref> has substantially the same configuration as that of the air diffusion device <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment, except for some alterations in terms of a coupling relationship between the base <b>11</b> and the perforated cover <b>13</b>, a coupling relationship between the base <b>11</b> and the securing mechanism <b>14</b>, and the like. In addition to the sealing member <b>15</b> between the base <b>11</b> and the perforated cover <b>13</b>, an additional sealing member <b>15</b> is interposed between the perforated cover <b>13</b> and the securing mechanism <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Two receiving grooves <b>22</b> are indented in the cover bonding portion <b>21</b> of the base <b>11</b>, two receiving grooves <b>44</b> are indented in the base bonding portion <b>43</b> of the perforated cover <b>13</b>, and a receiving groove <b>66</b> is indented in the cover pressure portion <b>48</b> of the securing mechanism <b>14</b>. One of the two receiving grooves <b>44</b> indented in the perforated cover <b>13</b> is open to the receiving groove <b>22</b> of the base <b>11</b> and the other receiving groove <b>44</b> is open to the receiving groove <b>66</b> of the cover pressure portion <b>44</b>. As the sealing member <b>15</b> is interposed between one receiving groove <b>44</b> of the perforated cover <b>13</b> and the receiving groove <b>22</b> of the base <b>11</b> facing each other, sealing between the base <b>11</b> and the perforated cover <b>13</b> is accomplished. In addition, as the sealing member <b>15</b> is interposed between the other receiving groove <b>44</b> of the perforated cover <b>13</b> and the receiving groove <b>66</b> of the cover pressure portion <b>48</b>, sealing between the perforated cover <b>13</b> and the securing mechanism <b>14</b> is accomplished.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Male screw threads are formed at the outer periphery of the top of the base <b>11</b>, and female screw threads corresponding to the male screw threads are formed at the inner periphery of the securing ring <b>47</b>, such that the securing ring <b>47</b> is fastened to the base <b>11</b> via screwing. In addition, an outwardly protruding ridge <b>67</b> is formed at a position of the outer periphery of the base <b>11</b> where the male screw threads end, and a valley <b>68</b> corresponding to the ridge <b>67</b> is formed at a position of an inner surface of the securing ring <b>47</b>. The ridge <b>67</b> is press-fitted into the valley <b>68</b> as the securing ring <b>47</b> is completely screwed to the base <b>11</b>, which prevents the securing ring <b>47</b> from being released from the base <b>11</b>. A release prevention configuration for preventing unintentional release of the securing ring <b>47</b> screwed to the base <b>11</b> is not limited thereto, and various other alterations are possible.</p>

      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">The air diffusion device, designated by reference numeral <b>70</b>, according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention has substantially the same configuration as that of the air diffusion device <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment, except for the impurity removal mechanism <b>27</b> having an altered configuration as compared to that in the air diffusion device <b>10</b> of the first embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The impurity removal mechanism <b>27</b> of the air diffusion device <b>70</b> according to the fourth embodiment includes the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> coupled to the base <b>11</b>, the opening/closing member <b>29</b> movably installed in the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b>, the spring <b>30</b> adapted to apply elastic force to the opening/closing member <b>29</b>, and the spring support structure <b>31</b> movably inserted into the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> to adjust the elastic force of the spring <b>30</b>. The impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> has the impurity inlet <b>32</b> connected to the air guide chamber <b>12</b> to allow the impurities S accumulated in the air guide chamber <b>12</b> to be introduced into the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b>, and the impurity outlet <b>33</b> configured to discharge the impurities S to the outside. The impurity inlet <b>32</b> is formed at one end of the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b>, and the impurity outlet <b>33</b> is formed in a spring support structure coupling portion <b>73</b>. The spring support structure coupling portion <b>73</b> is formed inside the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> at the other end thereof for coupling of the spring support structure <b>31</b>. The impurity discharge pipe <b>34</b> is connected to the other end of the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> to guide the impurities S, discharged from the impurity outlet <b>33</b>, to the outside.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The seat <b>35</b> having the orifice <b>36</b> is located in the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> near one end of the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b>. The opening/closing member <b>29</b> is adapted to come into close contact with the seat <b>35</b> or to be spaced apart from the seat <b>35</b> while moving in the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b>. The orifice <b>36</b> is closed and hermetically sealed when the opening/closing member <b>29</b> comes into close contact with the seat <b>35</b>, and is open when the opening/closing member <b>29</b> is spaced apart from the seat <b>35</b>. The spring <b>30</b> applies elastic force to the opening/closing member <b>29</b> in a given direction to assist the opening/closing member <b>29</b> in coming into close contact with the seat <b>35</b>. The opening/closing member <b>29</b> has a passage <b>71</b>, through which the impurities S having passed through the orifice <b>36</b> are moved to the impurity outlet <b>33</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">The spring support structure <b>31</b> includes the spring support member <b>37</b> configured to support the spring <b>30</b> in contact with the spring <b>30</b>, and the adjustor knob <b>38</b> coupled to one end of the spring support member <b>37</b>. The spring support member <b>37</b> has a passage <b>72</b>, through which the impurities S having passed through the passage <b>71</b> of the opening/closing member <b>29</b> are moved to the impurity outlet <b>33</b>. The adjustor knob <b>38</b> is provided with male screw threads, and is screwed through a knob fastening hole <b>74</b> formed in the center of the spring support structure coupling portion <b>73</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">The distal end of the adjustor knob <b>38</b> protrudes outward of the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> through the open lower end of the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b>. The spring support member <b>37</b> may be vertically moved as the user rotates the spring support member <b>37</b> by operating the adjustor knob <b>38</b>. The spring <b>30</b> comes into contact at one end thereof with the opening/closing member <b>29</b> and at the other end thereof with the spring support member <b>37</b>. As such, the spring <b>30</b> is compressed to thereby exert increased elastic force when the spring support member <b>37</b> is raised, and is stretched to thereby exert reduced elastic force when the spring support member <b>37</b> is lowered. In this way, the user may adjust the elastic force of the spring <b>30</b> by operating the adjustor knob <b>38</b>. Naturally, adjustment in the elastic force of the spring <b>30</b> using the adjustor knob <b>38</b> may be possible only before the impurity guide pipe <b>28</b> is connected to the impurity discharge pipe <b>34</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">When the pressure of the air guide chamber <b>12</b> is less than the elastic force of the spring <b>30</b>, the opening/closing member <b>29</b> is moved to come into close contact with the seat <b>35</b> to close and hermetically seal the orifice <b>36</b>, and thus air within the air guide chamber <b>12</b> is not discharged through the impurity removal mechanism <b>27</b>. On the other hand, when the impurities S are introduced into the air guide chamber <b>12</b> and the internal pressure of the air guide chamber <b>12</b> becomes greater than the elastic force of the spring <b>30</b>, as exemplarily shown, the opening/closing member <b>29</b> compresses the spring <b>30</b> and is spaced apart from the seat <b>35</b> to open the orifice <b>36</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Then, when the orifice <b>36</b> is open, the impurities S, introduced through the impurity inlet <b>32</b> from the air guide chamber <b>12</b>, sequentially pass through the orifice <b>36</b> and the passage <b>71</b> of the opening/closing member <b>29</b> and are moved to the spring support member <b>37</b>. Then, the impurities S, moved to the spring support member <b>37</b>, sequentially pass through the passage <b>72</b> of the spring support member <b>37</b> and the impurity outlet <b>33</b> of the spring support structure coupling portion <b>73</b>, and are discharged to the outside through the impurity discharge pipe <b>34</b>. When the pressure of the air guide chamber <b>12</b> again becomes less than the elastic force of the spring <b>30</b> as the impurities S are discharged from the air guide chamber <b>12</b>, the opening/closing member <b>29</b> is moved, by elastic force of the spring <b>30</b>, to come into close contact with the seat <b>35</b>, thereby again closing the orifice <b>36</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 12 to 14</figref> show an air diffusion device according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">As exemplarily shown in <figref>FIGS. 12 to 14</figref>, the air diffusion device, designated by reference numeral <b>80</b>, according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention includes the base <b>11</b> coupled to the air supply pipe <b>5</b> that is used to supply air, a perforated cover <b>82</b> coupled to the top of the base <b>11</b> to define the air guide chamber <b>12</b> between the base <b>11</b> and the perforated cover <b>82</b>, and the securing mechanism <b>14</b> configured to secure the perforated cover <b>82</b> to the base <b>11</b>. The sealing member <b>15</b> is interposed between the base <b>11</b> and the perforated cover <b>82</b> to seal a gap therebetween. Here, the base <b>11</b> and the securing mechanism <b>14</b> are equal to those in the embodiment exemplarily shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The perforated cover <b>82</b> of the air diffusion device <b>80</b> according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention is coupled to the upper surface of the base <b>11</b> to cover the top opening of the base <b>11</b>. The perforated cover <b>82</b> has a multi-stepped single layer shape, the height of which is reduced stepwise from the center to the edge. The perforated cover <b>82</b> has a plurality of through-holes <b>83</b> for air discharge. The perforated cover <b>82</b> includes a base bonding portion <b>84</b> provided at a lower edge thereof, the base bonding portion <b>84</b> coming into close contact with the cover bonding portion <b>21</b>. A receiving groove <b>85</b> for reception of the sealing member <b>15</b> is indented in the base bonding portion <b>84</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The through-holes <b>83</b> may be arranged in the entire perforated cover <b>82</b> or may be arranged in a portion of the perforated cover <b>82</b>, to discharge air, introduced into the air guide chamber <b>12</b>, upward of the perforated cover <b>82</b>. The perforated cover <b>82</b> has a non-perforated portion <b>86</b> having no through-hole <b>83</b>. The non-perforated portion <b>86</b> may be a linear or circular portion extending from the center to the edge of the perforated cover <b>82</b>. The through-holes <b>83</b> of the perforated cover <b>82</b> may reduce the rigidity of the perforated cover <b>82</b>. Thus, the non-perforated portion <b>86</b> having no through-hole <b>83</b> has a greater rigidity than the portion of the perforated cover <b>82</b> having the through-holes <b>83</b>. Thus, when providing the perforated cover <b>82</b> with a plurality of non-perforated portions <b>86</b>, the non-perforated portions <b>86</b> serve as reinforcement portions to increase rigidity of the perforated cover <b>82</b>, which may reduce damage to the perforated cover <b>82</b>. Although the non-perforated portions <b>86</b> are illustrated as having a crisscross arrangement in the drawing, the shape or arrangement of the non-perforated portions <b>86</b> may be altered in various ways.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The through-holes <b>83</b> are gradually reduced in size from an inner surface to an outer surface of the perforated cover <b>82</b>. Through provision of the tapered through-holes <b>83</b>, it is possible to reduce the size of bubbles to be discharged outward through the through-holes <b>83</b>. In addition, the through-holes <b>83</b> may be arranged in such a manner that a distance between the through-holes <b>83</b> increases from the edge to the center of the perforated cover <b>82</b>. That is, a distance between the through-holes <b>83</b> in a peripheral region of the perforated cover <b>82</b> is relatively small, and a distance between the through-holes <b>83</b> in a central region of the perforated cover <b>82</b> is relatively large. This increasing distance between the through-holes <b>83</b> from the edge to the center of the perforated cover <b>82</b> may cause bubbles discharged through the through-holes <b>83</b> to gather at the center of water, which may reduce generation of coarse bubbles.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The perforated cover <b>82</b> may be fabricated simply at low cost by bending a metal plate in a multi-layered form and perforating the through-holes <b>83</b> in the multi-layered metal plate. When perforating the through-holes <b>83</b> in the multi-layered metal plate, the through-holes <b>83</b> are preferably not perforated in bent portions. Since stress is concentrated at the bent portions upon application of external force, the through-holes <b>83</b> perforated in the bent portions may increase the risk of damage to the perforated cover <b>82</b>. The perforated cover <b>82</b> may be formed of various materials, such as composites, reinforced plastics, or the like, rather than the metal plate.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">After the perforated cover <b>82</b> is put on the base <b>11</b> such that the base bonding portion <b>84</b> of the perforated cover <b>82</b> is bonded to the cover bonding portion <b>21</b> of the base <b>11</b>, the perforated cover <b>82</b> is secured to the base <b>11</b> using the securing mechanism <b>14</b>. Securing of the perforated cover <b>82</b> using the securing mechanism <b>14</b> has been described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">In the present invention, instead of the perforated cover <b>13</b> having a flat plate shape, the perforated cover <b>82</b> having the multi-layered stepped shape may be applied to the various embodiments exemplarily shown in <figref>FIGS. 6 to 11</figref>, to construct various air diffusion devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">As described above, according to the present invention, as a result of assembling the perforated cover <b>13</b>; <b>82</b> having the through-holes <b>42</b>; <b>83</b> to the base <b>11</b> by means of the securing mechanism <b>14</b> that is separably coupled to the base <b>11</b>, the air diffusion device has ease in assembly and disassembly thereof. In addition, the through-holes <b>42</b>; <b>83</b> have an efficient arrangement in the perforated covers <b>13</b>; <b>82</b>, which ensures uniform aeration.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">Further, in the air diffusion device according to the present invention, impurities S introduced into the air guide chamber <b>12</b> may be automatically discharged outward of the air guide chamber <b>12</b> through the impurity removal mechanism <b>27</b>, which may reduce deterioration of aeration efficiency due to introduction of the impurities S. Moreover, easy management after installation is possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">Furthermore, in the air diffusion device according to the present invention, through provision of the diaphragm cover <b>58</b> used to open or close the air discharge hole <b>20</b> from which air is discharged into the air guide chamber <b>12</b>, the diaphragm cover <b>58</b>, which is spaced apart from the air discharge hole <b>20</b> during supply of air, may be elastically deformed when the supply of air stops, thereby covering the air discharge hole <b>20</b>. As such, it is possible to prevent wastewater, sludge, impurities, and the like from entering the air supply pipe <b>5</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">In the present invention, a coupling relationship between the perforated cover <b>13</b>; <b>82</b> and the base <b>11</b>, a configuration of the securing mechanism <b>14</b> used to secure the perforated cover <b>13</b>; <b>82</b> to the base <b>11</b>, a coupling relationship between the securing mechanism <b>14</b> and the perforated cover <b>13</b>; <b>82</b>, and a coupling relationship between the securing mechanism <b>14</b> and the base <b>11</b> are not limited to illustrations, and may be altered in various ways. In addition, a configuration of the air guide mechanism <b>19</b> or the impurity removal mechanism <b>27</b> or a coupling relationship between the air guide mechanism <b>19</b> or the impurity removal mechanism <b>27</b> and the base <b>11</b> may be altered in various ways.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">The embodiments of the present invention described above and illustrated in the drawings should not be construed as limiting the technical spirit of the present invention. The scope of the present invention should be defined as disclosed in the accompanying claims, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention</p>
