    <summary>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a process for the manufacturing of a multilayer drug delivery construct based on at least one drug loaded film. The present invention further relates to the multilayer drug delivery construct obtainable by the process of the present invention. The invention also relates to the use of the multilayer construct in ophthalmology, cardiovascular, pain management, musculoskeletal, cancer treatment in central nervous system (CNS) or in vaccines delivery.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The development of drug delivery constructs for controlled and/or sustained release of drugs is an area of interest in the pharmaceutical industry. Known drug delivery constructs are for example particles such as micro-and nanoparticles, fibers, rods, films or coatings. The drug delivery constructs often comprise a drug dispersed in a biocompatible polymer matrix which can be implanted, administered orally or injected. The polymers most often used are for example poly-(lactic acid) or poly-(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid).</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Drug delivery constructs capable of providing a sustained, local delivery of therapeutics provide unique opportunities and more efficacious strategies for the treatment of various pathologies. The requisite therapeutic dose together with the desire for prolonged release durations often necessitates high drug loadings in constructs to provide efficacious controlled release solutions. Additionally, the sensitivity of, for example therapeutic biologics, to local environmental stresses often compels the formulation of drugs with a combination of stabilizing excipients. The required mass or volume of this combined payload (drugs+excipients), coupled with conventional (practical) constraints on drug delivery construct size, often results in a drug delivery construct with relatively high weight (and/or volume) fractions of payload relative to the overall drug delivery construct mass (and/or volume).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Drug delivery constructs with a high loading of drugs (i.e., high solid content of payload relative to polymer) typically exhibit uncontrolled and rapid release of the drugs into the surrounding medium. This is due in part to isolated drug-rich domains present at the surface of the construct that have direct access to the surrounding medium.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">When the construct is placed in a medium the payload rapidly solubilizes and releases (i.e. diffuses) out of the construct. If moreover the total volumetric loading of drug-rich domains in a construct exceeds a critical value (e.g., the percolation threshold or critical porosity range, Siegel, R. A. et al., <i>J. Controlled Release </i>8 (1989) 223-236), the close proximity of domains within the matrix leads to clustering and interconnectivity. If then any part of this interconnected domains has access to the medium, solubilization and diffusion of drugs can lead to a rapid release of large fractions of the total drug-load. The extent to which the percolation threshold is exceeded influences the extent of domain interconnectivity within a construct and in turn, the overall fraction of drug-load that will rapidly be released from the construct. The actual volume fraction of payload needed to reach the percolation threshold (i.e., critical volumetric loading) within a given construct is dependent on a number of factors such as the construct dimensions, particle (domain) size, particle (domain) size distribution, homogeneity of the particle distribution within the matrix, ratio of particle size to construct thickness, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The object of the present invention is to overcome or mitigate the above mentioned disadvantages.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Surprisingly it has been found that the above disadvantages can be overcome by providing a process for the manufacturing of multilayer drug delivery constructs comprising at least one drug loaded film, manufactured by the following steps: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>(a) dissolving the polymer in a solvent</li><li>(b) mixing the dissolved polymer with a drug</li><li>(c) laminating the mixture between at least two polymeric sheets, whereby at least one polymeric sheet is permeable to the solvent,</li><li>(d) removing the sheets to provide the drug loaded film</li><li>(e) layering the drug loaded film</li><li>(f) fusing the layered film into a multilayer construct</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0014">Surprisingly the above process provides a multilayer drug delivery construct with unique opportunities to control and extend the release of the loaded drugs.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0015">In priority filing EP11194043.3 a process is described for the manufacturing of a drug delivery system based on a polymer comprising dispersed bioactive agent or drug via the following process steps: <ul id="ul-00003-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00004-en" list-style="none"><li>(a) dissolving a polymer in an organic solvent</li><li>(b) mixing the dissolved polymer with the bioactive agent</li><li>(c) laminating the mixture between at least two sheets of polymeric material, whereby at least one sheet is permeable to the organic solvent, to provide a single layer film. A disadvantage of a single drug loaded film approaching the percolation threshold has an interconnected open pore network. The release profile of drugs from such film shows an initial burst release and a rapid release of drugs in the open pore network due to diffusion through the network.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0019">In the present invention it has been found that the layering of at least one drug loaded film generates a multilayer drug delivery construct with improved release profiles by reducing the likelihood of interconnected pore networks but also by improving the overall homogeneity of drug distribution in the construct. Moreover the process of the present invention provides drug-loaded films with a limited solvent exposure, no elevated temperatures and improved drug dispersion.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0020">The process of the present invention provides opportunities for the incorporation of multiple dispersed drugs within the construct and facilitates the (initial) physical separation of different drugs within the construct. Moreover it provides an opportunity for sequential release of individual drugs by controlling the properties of the layered and fused films.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0021">In one embodiment of the present invention, the multilayer drug delivery construct may further comprise at least a non-drug loaded polymeric film. This non-drug loaded polymeric film may be included at the periphery of the multilayer construct or it may be included within the multilayer construct. The inclusion of non-drug loaded films at the periphery of the multilayer construct will improve the release profiles by limiting the amount of drug at the surface of the construct therefore decreasing burst release. Moreover it will act as a diffusion limiting membrane.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0022">The inclusion of non-drug loaded films within the multi-layer construct will improve the release profiles by reducing the presence of interconnected pore networks that span the entire construct. One can imagine that the inclusion of non-drug loaded films providing many options for triggered or timed release based on the material properties of the non-drug loaded polymeric film.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0023">The non-drug loaded films can be prepared via various methodologies known in the art for example via solvent casting, compression molding, lamination, etc. The non-drug loaded film may comprise the same or a different polymer as the drug loaded films.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0024">The polymer as referred to in step (a) or as used in the non-drug loaded film can be any biostable, bioerodable or biodegradable polymer selected from the group consisting of (a) polyester homopolymers and copolymers such as polyglycolic acid (PGA), polylactic acid (PLA) including poly-L-lactic acid, poly-D-lactic acid and poly-D,L-lactic acid, poly(beta-hydroxybutyrate), polygluconate including poly-D-gluconate, poly-L-gluconate, poly-D,L-gluconate, poly(epsilon-caprolactone), poly(delta-valerolactone), poly(p-dioxanone), poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) which can have a range of ratios of lactic acid to glycolic acid, additionally with either the racemic or meso DL lactide or the pure L-lactide, poly(lactic acid-co-delta-valerolactone), poly(lactic acid-co-epsilon-caprolactone), poly(lactic acid-co-beta-malic acid), poly(beta-hydroxybutyrate-co-beta-hydroxyvalerate), poly(1,3-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)propane-co-sebacic acid), and poly(sebacic acid-co-fumaric acid), among others, (b) poly(ortho ester) homopolymers and copolymers such as those synthesized by copolymerization of various diketene acetals and diols, among others, (c) polyanhydride homopolymers and copolymers such as poly(adipic anhydride), poly(suberic anhydride), poly(sebacic anhydride), poly(dodecanedioic anhydride), poly(maleic anhydride), poly(1,3-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)methane anhydride) and poly (alpha,omega-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)alkane anhydrides) such as poly(1,3-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)propane anhydride) and poly(1,3-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)hexane anhydride), (d) polycarbonate homopolymers and copolymers such as poly(trimethylene carbonate), poly(lactic acid-co-trimethylene carbonate) and poly(glycolic acid-co-trimethylene carbonate) and (e) amino-acid-based polymers including tyrosine-based polyarylates (e.g., copolymers of a diphenol and a diacid linked by ester bonds, with diphenols selected, for instance, from ethyl, butyl, hexyl, octyl and benzyl esters of desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine and diacids selected, for instance, from succinic, glutaric, adipic, suberic and sebacic acid), tyrosine-based polycarbonates (f) polyesteramides, polythioesters, polyesterurethanes, polyesterurea's, polyurethanes, polyurethane acrylate, poly(amino acids), polypeptides, polyamides, polysaccharides, polyethers, polysulfones, poly(meth)acrylates, polysiloxanes or polyolefins. Any suitable blends or copolymers of these materials can also be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0025">Drug delivery constructs composed of bioerodible or biodegradable polymers typically employ drug loadings sufficiently below the percolation threshold to facilitate sustained release via mechanisms such as polymer erosion or matrix swelling.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0026">The term biostable as used herein means a material not intended to degrade in vivo during the intended lifetime.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0027">The terms biodegradable or bioerodable as used herein refer to material which is capable of being completely or substantially degraded or eroded when exposed to an in vivo environment or a representative in vitro environment. A polymer is capable of being degraded or eroded when it can be gradually broken-down, resorbed, absorbed and/or eliminated by, for example, hydrolysis, hydration, solubilization, enzymolysis, oxidation, metabolic processes, bulk or surface erosion, and the like within a subject. It should be appreciated that traces or residue of polymer may remain following biodegradation and bioerosion.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0028">Preferably the polymer is a biodegradable or bioerodable polymer selected from the group consisting of the above mentioned polyesters (a) or polyesteramides comprising amino-acids. Still more preferably the polyesteramide has a structure according to Formula (I),</p>

The polyesteramide can be fabricated in a variety of molecular weights and a variety of relative proportions of the m, p, and q units in the backbone. The appropriate molecular weight for a particular use is readily determined by one skilled in the art. A suitable Mn will be in the order of about 15,000 to about 100,000 Daltons, for example from about 30,000 to about 80,000 or from about 35,000 to about 75,000.

      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0057">The polyesteramides of Formula (III) may for example be synthesized as shown in scheme 1; via solution polycondensation of para-toluene sulfonate di-amines salts (X1, X2, X3, X4) with activated di-acids (Y1). Typically dimethylsulfoxide or dimethylformamide are used as solvent. Generally as a base 1.1 eq triethylamide is added with respect to the amount of para-toluene sulfonate, the reaction is carried out under an inert atmosphere at 60Â° C. for 24-72 hours under constant stirring. Subsequently the obtained reaction mixture is purified via a water precipitation followed by an organic precipitation and filtration. Drying under reduced pressure yields the polyesteramide.</p>

The solvent to be used depends on the polymer to be dissolved and on the nature of the polymer sheet used in process step (c) because the solvent should be permeable to the polymer sheet. The choice can however be readily determined by one of skill in the art. In the present invention methylene chloride, chloroform, ethanol or methanol are preferably used as the solvent.</p>

      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0065">After the laminating step (c) the sheets are removed to provide a drug loaded film (d). The multilayer construct may be generated via layering (e) of the drug loaded film by for example folding or rolling. It is however also possible that more than one drug loaded film is layered. The drug loaded films may than each comprise the same or a different polymer and/or the same or a different drug. Also possible is to process the drug loaded film (d) into pieces for example by cutting which pieces are fused together to prepare at least two layers.</p>

      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0069">The process of the present invention provides the advantage that only mild process steps are carried out with respect to temperature, pressure and presence of solvents. The process can be carried out at temperatures between 0-40 degrees Celcius, preferably between 15-30 degrees Celcius. More preferably the process of the present invention is carried out at room temperature. Room temperature means a temperature between 20-25 degrees Celsius, preferably 20 degrees Celsius.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0070">It is known that the manufacturing of a drug delivery construct in which the drug is for example a protein causes difficult issues to deal with. Effective processes for the manufacturing of drug delivery constructs comprising the incorporation of thermally sensitive or solvent sensitive drugs, such as many proteins, peptides and polynucleotides are limited due to the typical processing conditions employed, which are often at elevated temperatures (greater than about 45Â° C.) and/or generate aqueous/organic interfaces (i.,e.emulsions). These process conditions may result in a significant loss of the activity of the protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0071">A great advantage of the process according to the invention is that it produces a substantial homogeneous dispersion of the drug throughout the multilayer construct without using heat extrusion. The process further allows the use of process conditions such as a low temperature, limited durations of solvent exposure and a mild solvent removal. Therefore this process is in particular suitable for thermally or solvent sensitive or âlabileâ drugs such as many proteins, polypeptides or polynucleotides.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0072">The term âlabileâ drug as used herein refers to a drug in which chemical or structural changes occur upon exposure to even benign environmental stresses (e.g., when either warmed to elevated temperatures, such as temperatures greater than physiological temperatures (about 37Â° C.), or dissolved in an organic solvent or in solution at an aqueous/organic interface) which can result in a substantial loss of (bio) activity and/or the development of unintended or undesired physiological responses. The process of the present invention thus allows the formation of drug delivery constructs maintaining a high degree of drug integrity, for example, protein activity present prior to processing.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0073">The present invention further relates to a multilayer construct comprising at least two drug loaded films fused together and optional at least a non-drug loaded film layered onto or into the fused films whereby the films comprise a bioerodable polymer and whereby the drug loaded films comprise at least a dispersed drug.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0074">The present invention further relates to a multilayer construct obtainable by the process of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0075">The multilayer construct is preferably further processed into a subsequently implantable or injectable drug delivery system such as a fiber, rod, disc, coating, tube or rolled film. The construct is therefore shaped via cutting and/or molding into the desired form. The construct preferably has a thickness in the range of 1 micrometer to 1 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0076">The present invention also relates to the use of the multilayer construct in ophthalmology, cardiovascular, pain management, musculoskeletal, cancer treatment, in the central nervous system or in vaccine delivery.</p>

      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0114">Polymer devices containing rhGH (Genotropin Miniquick 2 mg; Pfizer; Kent, N.J. U.S.A) were exposed to predetermined volumes of release medium at 37Â° C. over set periods of time. The release medium was composed of phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) with added Tween 20 (0.3 wt %) and sodium azide (0.1 wt %). After a set period time, during which polymer devices were submerged in the release medium and incubated at 37Â° C., the total volume of release medium was removed with a mechanical pipette and stored at 4Â° C. for subsequent analysis (i.e., referred to as release samples). A known volume of fresh release medium was then added to the polymer devices with a mechanical pipette and incubation at 37Â° C. continued. After set periods of time, the release medium was removed and replaced in the same manner as stated above.</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="2">Results</heading>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0115">The concentration of rHGH present in release samples at time points from 1 hour to 395 hours was measured using aqueous SEC-HPLC by correlation of peak area (i.e., 17 min elution volume) to rhGH concentration through use of a calibration curve (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0116">The concentration of rHGH present in release samples was expressed in cumulative percentage of protein release compared to the theoretical rhGH-load in the respective polymer devices (<figref>FIG. 4</figref> for examples 1 and 2; <figref>FIG. 5</figref> for examples 3 and 4). The presence of non-loaded polymer layers on top and bottom of devices (examples 2 and 4) show to reduce significantly the release of protein compared to non-covered devices (examples 1 and 3).</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0117">Bioactivity of rHGH released from polymer devices was measured through use of the cell-proliferation assay described above. Release samples were all diluted with and same factor and introduced to the cell culture medium. The effect of rHGH on cell proliferation was measured via cell counting with capillary cytometry. A positive cell response was measured from release samples taken at 1 h indicating that rHGH released from the polymer devices was bioactive (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>). As a negative control, release samples taken at 1 h, were exposed to elevated temperature and pressure (i.e., autoclave) in order to denature and/or deactivate the rHGH. A qualitative difference in cell response to release samples before and after autoclaving was recorded, validating our experimental method.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0118">These results confirm that rHGH present in and subsequently released from the polymer devices is bioactive. These results also confirm that multi-layer constructs can be prepared that demonstrate improved release characteristics such as reduced burst release and prolonged release duration of loaded APIs.</p>
