      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for producing antimony trisulfide that is used for a brake pad and the like.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Most of the antimony trisulfide available on the market is produced by processing natural antimony trisulfide ore (stibnite). Specifically, when natural antimony trisulfide ore is melted, antimony trisulfide precipitates, while impurities such as gangue float up. Antimony trisulfide can thus be collected.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Antimony trisulfide can also be produced by mixing an antimony metal powder and sulfur, and calcining the mixture. Antimony metal can be produced using the method disclosed in JP-A-6-322455, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">It is also possible to collect antimony trisulfide that precipitates when antimony trioxide is added to a sodium sulfide solution, and hydrogen sulfide is passed through the solution. Antimony trioxide can be obtained by volatilization-oxidation refining disclosed in JP-A-6-329417, for example. Antimony trioxide is abundantly available on the market as a fine powder.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Since antimony trisulfide produced using the method that produces antimony trisulfide from natural antimony trisulfide ore has a relatively high content of lead, arsenic, and crystalline silica (quartz) (i.e., impurities), it has been desired to reduce the content of these impurities taking account of the natural environment and the working environment during the production process.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">When using the method that produces antimony trisulfide from an antimony metal powder, the metal powder precipitates under molten sulfur, and reactivity is poor. The reactivity can be relatively improved by utilizing an antimony metal powder having a particle size of 10 micrometer or less that is obtained by grinding an antimony mass. However, the particle size of antimony metal obtained by grinding an antimony mass is normally 20 to 30 micrometers, and it is very expensive to obtain an antimony metal powder having a particle size of 10 micrometer or less by grinding an antimony mass.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The method that adds antimony trioxide to a sodium sulfide solution, and passes hydrogen sulfide through the solution is more expensive than the method that produces antimony trisulfide from an antimony metal powder.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">An object of the invention is to provide a method for producing antimony trisulfide that can inexpensively produce antimony trisulfide that has a relatively low content of lead, arsenic, and crystalline silica (i.e., impurities).</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">According to one aspect of the invention, a method for producing antimony trisulfide includes charging a reaction vessel with an antimony trioxide powder and sulfur, and heating the inside of the reaction vessel to react antimony trioxide with sulfur.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">When the antimony trioxide powder and sulfur are heated inside the reaction vessel, sulfur takes oxygen from antimony trioxide to form SO<sub>2</sub>, and vaporizes, while Sb and S bond to each other to produce Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3 </sub>(see the following reaction formula).</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]2Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>+9S=2Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>+3SO<sub>2 </sub>[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0012">Since antimony trioxide is obtained by volatilization-oxidation refining, antimony trioxide has a small particle size and a large specific surface area, and exhibits good reactivity. Moreover, high-purity antimony trioxide having a low content of impurities (e.g., lead, arsenic, and crystalline silica) is easily available. It is possible to inexpensively produce antimony trisulfide having a low content of impurities by utilizing high-purity antimony trioxide as a raw material.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0013">The method for producing antimony trisulfide according to one aspect of the invention achieves a high reaction efficiency as compared with the case of producing antimony trisulfide from an antimony metal powder and a sulfur powder.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0014">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a view illustrating production of antimony trisulfide from an antimony metal powder and a sulfur powder, wherein the left side illustrates a state in which a reaction vessel <b>20</b> is charged with a raw material <b>3</b>â² prepared by mixing an antimony metal powder and a sulfur powder, and the right side illustrates a state in which sulfur is melted by heating the raw material <b>3</b>â². Since the specific gravity (about 1.8) of liquid sulfur is significantly lower than the specific gravity (about 6.7) of antimony metal, antimony metal easily precipitates in liquid sulfur, and unreacted antimony metal that does not come in contact with sulfur tends to remain in the lower part of the reaction vessel <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0015">
        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> is a view illustrating production of antimony trisulfide from an antimony trioxide powder and a sulfur powder according to one aspect of the invention, wherein the left side illustrates a state in which a reaction vessel <b>20</b> is charged with a raw material <b>3</b> prepared by mixing an antimony trioxide powder and a sulfur powder, and the right side illustrates a state in which sulfur is melted by heating the raw material <b>3</b>. The specific gravity (about 5.2) of antimony trioxide is higher than the specific gravity (about 1.8) of liquid sulfur, but is lower than the specific gravity (about 6.7) of antimony metal. Since bubbles <b>4</b> of sulfurous acid gas are formed by the reaction of antimony trioxide with liquid sulfur which perturb the raw material <b>3</b>, antimony trioxide rarely precipitates in liquid sulfur, and unreacted antimony trioxide rarely remains in the reaction vessel <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0016">It is preferable that the antimony trioxide powder have an average particle size of 2 micrometers or less. If the average particle size of the antimony trioxide powder exceeds 2 micrometers, a deterioration in reactivity and an increase in energy cost may occur, and unreacted antimony trioxide may remain in the resulting antimony trisulfide.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0017">Note that the term âaverage particle sizeâ used herein refers to an equivalent specific surface diameter calculated based on a specific surface area determined in accordance with JIS Z 8830 (âDetermination of the specific surface area of powders (solids) by gas adsorption-BET methodâ).</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0018">It is preferable that the inside of the reaction vessel be heated at 250 to 700Â° C. If the heating temperature is less than the 250Â° C., the timing at which sulfur is melted and the reaction starts may be delayed. If the heating temperature exceeds 700Â° C., it may be a waste of energy.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0019">Sulfur may be used in an amount larger than the stoichiometric amount of the product, and the inside of the reaction vessel may be heated after filling the reaction vessel with an inert gas.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0020">The stoichiometric amount of antimony trioxide is 2 mol, and the stoichiometric amount of sulfur is 9 mol. It is preferable to use sulfur in an amount of 10 to 11 mol based on 2 mol of antimony trioxide.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0021">This makes it possible to suppress a situation in which unreacted antimony trioxide remains in the resulting antimony trisulfide.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0022">The reaction vessel may include a gas inlet and a gas outlet. An inert gas such as nitrogen may be fed through the gas inlet before heating the reaction vessel to fill the reaction vessel with the inert gas. The inert gas may be fed through the gas inlet after producing antimony trisulfide by heating the inside of the reaction vessel to discharge vaporized sulfur gas from the reaction vessel through the gas outlet.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0023">Note that the inert gas may be continuously fed to the reaction vessel (i.e., purging) while producing antimony trisulfide by heating the inside of the reaction vessel.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0024">This makes it possible to prevent a situation in which antimony reacts with oxygen in air.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0025">Antimony trisulfide produced may be melted by heating the antimony trisulfide to a temperature equal to or higher than its melting point, discharged from the reaction vessel in the form of a liquid, and solidified by cooling. The melting point of antimony trisulfide is 550Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0026">This makes it possible to continuously produce antimony trisulfide using a reaction vessel.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Advantageous Effects of the Invention</heading>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0027">One aspect of the invention can thus inexpensively and easily produce antimony trisulfide that has a relatively low content of lead, arsenic, and crystalline silica (i.e., impurities).</p>

The production equipment <b>1</b> includes a vessel section <b>2</b>, a stage <b>10</b>, a support section <b>11</b>, and a cylinder <b>12</b>. The vessel section <b>2</b> is rotatably supported by a rotary shaft <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the support section <b>11</b>, and is rotated by the cylinder <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0036">The vessel section <b>2</b> includes a reaction vessel (crucible) <b>20</b>, an electric furnace <b>21</b>, and a lid <b>22</b>. The reaction vessel <b>20</b> is fitted inside the electric furnace <b>21</b>, and is heated by a heater <b>21</b><i>a. </i>The lid <b>22</b> is made of glass wool or the like, and is removable. Quartz tubes <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> are provided through the lid <b>22</b>. The end of the quartz tube <b>23</b> serves as an inlet <b>23</b><i>a </i>for introducing an inert gas (nitrogen gas), and the end of the quartz tube <b>24</b> serves as an outlet <b>24</b><i>a </i>for discharging gas contained in the reaction vessel. The quartz tube <b>24</b> is connected to a desulfurization device (not illustrated in the drawings), and gas discharged from the reaction vessel is desulfurized. Note that reference sign <b>20</b><i>a </i>indicates an outlet for discharging the resulting antimony trisulfide, and reference sign <b>3</b> indicates a raw material.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0037">The raw material <b>3</b> was prepared by mixing an antimony trioxide fine powder and a sulfur powder in a weight ratio of 5:3 (molar ratio: 2:10.9). Antimony trioxide had an average particle size of 1.17 micrometers, and had an Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>content of 99.82 wt %, an As content of 0.03 wt % or less, a Pb content of 0.001 wt % or less, and an Fe content of less than 0.001 wt %. Sulfur had a particle size of less than 90 micrometers.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0038">After charging the reaction vessel <b>20</b> with the raw material, the lid <b>22</b> was fitted (see <figref>FIG. 3</figref>), and nitrogen gas was fed to the reaction vessel <b>20</b> through the quartz tube <b>23</b> to completely replace the atmosphere (air) inside the reaction vessel <b>20</b> with the nitrogen gas. The reaction vessel <b>20</b> was then heated using the electric furnace. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the temperature inside the reaction vessel <b>20</b> rapidly increased to about 580Â° C. due to heat of reaction after 400Â° C. had been reached. The remaining sulfur was almost completely vaporized when about 2 hours had elapsed from the start of heating. Therefore, nitrogen gas was fed to the reaction vessel <b>20</b> through the quartz tube <b>23</b> to completely discharge the sulfur gas from the reaction vessel <b>20</b>. After removing the lid <b>23</b>, the vessel section <b>2</b> was rotated (see the broken line in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) to remove molten antimony trisulfide through the outlet <b>20</b><i>a. </i>Antimony trisulfide thus removed was solidified by natural cooling.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0039">Antimony trisulfide thus produced was crushed, and subjected to componential analysis. The results are shown in Table 1.</p>

      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0040">Antimony trisulfide of the comparative example shown in Table 1 was produced from natural antimony trisulfide ore.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0041">As shown in Table 1, antimony trisulfide produced using the method according to one embodiment of the invention had a significantly low content of impurities such as lead, arsenic, and crystalline silica, as compared with antimony trisulfide of the comparative example. The content of antimony trioxide and free sulfur remaining in the product was very low due to high reactivity.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0042">Antimony trisulfide was produced using a raw material prepared by mixing antimony trioxide having an average particle size of 1.17 micrometers and sulfur having a particle size of less than 90 micrometers while changing the amount of sulfur by a factor of 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 with respect to the theoretical amount (stoichiometric amount) to determine the reaction ratio (i.e., the content (mass %) of antimony trisulfide in the product). The results are shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. The reaction ratio was about 95% when the amount of sulfur was larger than the theoretical amount by a factor of 1.1, and exceeded 98% when the amount of sulfur was larger than the theoretical amount by a factor of 1.2, and the difference between the reaction ratio when the amount of sulfur was larger than the theoretical amount by a factor of 1.2 and the reaction ratio when the amount of sulfur was larger than the theoretical amount by a factor of 1.3 was very small. Therefore, it is appropriate to set the amount of sulfur to be larger than the theoretical amount by a factor of about 1.1 to about 1.3.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0043">Table 2 shows a comparison between the reaction ratio achieved in the example in which a raw material prepared by mixing antimony trioxide having an average particle size of 0.4, 1.2, or 7.1 micrometers and a sulfur powder was used, and the reaction ratio achieved in the comparative example in which a raw material prepared by mixing antimony metal and a sulfur powder was used. The amount of sulfur was set to be larger than the stoichiometric amount by a factor of about 1.2.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0044">As is clear from Table 2, the reaction ratio achieved in the example was significantly higher than the reaction ratio achieved in the comparative example.</p>
