      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention is in the field treating livestock. In particular, the present invention is directed to milking, disinfecting and other treatment of dairy livestock.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Automated systems for treating dairy livestock are known. For example, robotic milking machines are known. Typically, a milking robot comprises an arm that attaches a milking unit to a cow (or other dairy livestock). Other operations of a milking robot arm may include removing a milking unit from a cow, placing the milking unit in a housing etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">However, known systems and methods suffer from a number of drawbacks. For example, the arm of a milking robot travels relatively long distances and covers large spaces. For example, in order to attach a milking unit to a cow, the arm needs to enter (and exit) the stall containing the cow.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Embodiments of the invention may include a system and method for treating livestock. In particular, embodiments of the invention may include a system and method directed to milking, disinfecting and other treatment of dairy livestock. An embodiment of a system may include a ramp for containing dairy livestock and one or more mobile units configured to travel on the ramp, below the dairy livestock, and perform at least one action related to a treatment of the dairy livestock.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">An action performed by a mobile unit may be, or may include, milking, disinfecting, cleaning the ramp, washing the livestock, acquiring an image, identifying the livestock, testing for pregnancy, capturing a heartbeat of a fetus and heating an organ of the livestock.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">An embodiment of a system may include ramp adapted to translate both the livestock and the mobile unit. An embodiment of a system may include ramp configured to house a milking equipment unit and a mobile unit may be adapted to detach the milking equipment unit from a housing and attach the milking equipment unit to dairy livestock.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">A mobile unit may be adapted to determine its location and, based on its location, determine a location of a milking equipment unit. A plurality of mobile units and a central management unit may be configured to dynamically cause at least some of the plurality of mobile units to each perform a portion of a treatment or task. A first mobile unit may be adapted to attach a first portion of a milking unit to the dairy livestock and a second mobile unit may be adapted to attach a second portion of the milking equipment to the dairy livestock.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">An embodiment of a system may include ramp that includes a guide designed to keep the mobile unit within a predefined path under the livestock. An embodiment of a system may include a ramp that includes stalls and a mobile unit may be adapted to automatically travel from a first stall to a second stall. A ramp may include a mark and a mobile unit may be adapted to use the mark in order to determine its location with respect to a stall. A mobile unit may be configured to travel between legs of the livestock.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">An embodiment of a system may include a maintenance pit for servicing mobile units. A mobile unit may travel from a guide to a service or maintenance pit. A first mobile unit may be adapted or caused complete an action which at least one other mobile unit failed to complete. A mobile unit may include sensors and/or treatment units.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">An embodiment of a system may include a central management unit adapted to instruct or cause a mobile unit to perform an action. An embodiment of a system may include a set of mobile units configured to inter-communicate in order to collaborate in performing an action related to treatment of the livestock.</p>

      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Although dairy livestock (and in particular, cows) are mainly discussed herein, it will be understood that embodiments of the invention may be applicable to any type of livestock (e.g., goats, sheep, horses etc.). Although milking of dairy livestock is mainly discussed herein it will be understood that embodiments of the invention may be applicable to other operations, or treatments of livestock. For example, treatments such as disinfecting or washing the livestock, heating an organ of the livestock and/or milking may all be enabled or performed by a system or method according to embodiments of the invention. Embodiments of the invention may be applicable to operations such as; acquiring an image, testing for pregnancy or capturing a heartbeat of a fetus and/or identifying the livestock.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Reference is made to <figref>FIG. 1</figref> that shows an exemplary system <b>105</b> according to embodiments of the invention. As shown by <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, system <b>105</b> may include a walkway or ramp <b>130</b>, an enclosure, fence or stall <b>120</b> for containing livestock (e.g., containing cow <b>110</b> as shown), a milking unit <b>150</b> and a mobile unit <b>140</b>. In embodiment, mobile unit <b>140</b> may be a mobile robot designed to travel on ramp <b>130</b> and under the livestock (e.g., under cow <b>110</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). For example, mobile unit <b>140</b> may be designed and manufactured such that it freely travels under, and between the legs of, the livestock.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Various models of mobile unit <b>140</b> may be contemplated, for example, a model used for goats may be smaller than one used for cows. In one embodiment, mobile unit <b>140</b> is adapted for treating cows. Assuming a space of up to 60 centimeters in height is available under an average cow, mobile unit <b>140</b>, including an attached arm, may be designed such that it can freely travel through a space that is 50 centimeters in height. Mobile unit <b>140</b> may be designed such that it can travel between the fore and hind legs of a cow. Accordingly, mobile unit <b>140</b> may small enough in size and may travel under cows standing on a ramp as described.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Including a small mobile unit <b>140</b> as described, embodiments of the invention enable advantages which that cannot be achieved by system and methods known in the art. As discussed above, robotic milking machines known in the art use an arm that is based (or extends from) outside the stall containing the livestock. In operation, such arm needs to extend into the stall and under the livestock, e.g., in order to attach a milking unit. An arm extending from outside the stall may harm the livestock when traveling since its path may collide with the livestock, e.g., the legs of a cow in the stall. Moreover, the distance traveled by an arm based (or extending from) outside the stall is relatively long.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Designed to fit, and operate, under the livestock, and travel between the legs of the livestock, mobile unit <b>140</b> as described herein eliminates some of the above mentioned drawbacks. For example, as further described herein, mobile unit <b>140</b> may travel to a location under the livestock from the side of the livestock, thus, entering a location between the fore and hind legs along a path does not collide with the legs of the livestock.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Embodiments of the invention enable treating livestock by a system that minimizes the movement or distance travelled by an arm. For example, movement of arm <b>210</b> may be minimal, e.g., extending from under the cow to a housing of a milking unit that may be in close proximity.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Reference is made to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, schematically showing a mobile unit <b>140</b> according to embodiments of the invention.

For example, nozzles included in treatments units <b>240</b> may eject water or other liquids on cows standing on ramp <b>405</b>. Nozzles or jets included in treatments units <b>240</b> may be used to wash ramp <b>405</b>. Acting as a robot, a mobile unit described herein may move arm <b>215</b> such that nozzles or jets are directed to wash a livestock or wash ramp <b>405</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Treatments units <b>240</b> and/or sensing units <b>230</b> may include a camera usable for acquiring an image. For example, arm <b>215</b> may place or aim a camera included in sensing units <b>230</b> such that an image of a cow's belly or udder is captured. An image acquired as described may be used for attaching a milking unit (e.g., by determining exact or relevant location of teats). An image may be used to identify a cow. For example, by analyzing an image of an udder or an image of a mark on a cow's belly, the cow may be identified. For example, hot-iron branding on a belly of a cow may be identified by processing an image of the cow's belly and using known image or pattern recognition methods. For example, an image of the cow's belly may be processed by controller <b>310</b> or controller <b>474</b>, a mark may be identified in the processed image and a database that includes a list of the cows and their respective marks may be used in order to identify the cow. Other marks (e.g., made using freeze using liquid nitrogen or dry ice) may be similarly identified. Accordingly, sensing units <b>230</b> may include a sensing devices for identifying the livestock.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Other devices or sensors included in treatments units <b>240</b> and/or sensing units <b>230</b> may be devices or sensors for testing for pregnancy as known in the art. For example, an ultrasound sensing device included in sensing units <b>230</b> may be used to capture a heartbeat of a fetus.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Any data acquired by sensing units <b>230</b> may be stored. For example, images acquired by a camera or signals acquired by a pregnancy sensor may be stored on data storage unit <b>340</b>. Any data stored on data storage unit <b>340</b> may be downloaded or uploaded to a remote computer or data in data storage unit <b>340</b> may be communicated over a network. Data in data storage unit <b>340</b> may be transferred or copied using a direct wire, e.g., using a USB port included in mobile unit <b>140</b>. Accordingly, it will be understood that data acquired, processed or generated by mobile units such as <b>441</b>, <b>442</b>, <b>443</b>, <b>444</b>, <b>445</b> and/or <b>140</b> may be available to other components of system <b>400</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In one embodiment, mobile unit <b>140</b> (or similar mobile units shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>) may travel to a predefined location under a cow and perform operations described herein when located at the predefined spot or location. For example, an optimal location for treating a cow may be right under the cow, at a short distance from the udder. At the predefined location, mobile unit <b>140</b> may rotate or otherwise move or maneuver such it is at a selected orientation. For example, mobile unit <b>140</b> may rotate itself such that arm <b>215</b> is at minimal distance from holders <b>430</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">To determine its location, mobile unit <b>140</b> may use any applicable system or technique. For example, controller <b>310</b> (or controller <b>474</b>) may use image processing techniques in order to determine a location of mobile unit <b>140</b>, based on video or images received from a camera in sensor units <b>230</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">An electro-mechanic switch may be used in order to enable mobile unit <b>140</b> to determine it has reached a predefined spot in a stall. For example, a mechanical sensor included in mobile unit <b>140</b> may be configured to detect a mark on guide <b>410</b>. For example, guide <b>410</b> may include a bulge (or cavity or hole) that marks a center of a stall and a rod connected to a micro-switch included in mobile unit <b>140</b> may slide along guide <b>410</b> and activate the micro-switch when reaching the bulge or cavity. An activation of the micro-switch may enable mobile unit <b>140</b> to determine it is located in a center of a stall. An optical sensor included in mobile unit <b>140</b> may detect an optically detectable signal emitted from a source placed in a center of a stall. In yet other embodiments, a mark may be or include a magnet placed in a stall and a sensor adapted to sense a change in magnetic flux may be included in mobile unit <b>140</b> such that mobile unit <b>140</b> may stop or park in a stall based on a sensed magnetic field or flux.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">In an embodiment, ramp <b>130</b> includes stalls for containing the livestock. For example, when entering platform <b>405</b> as shown by arrow <b>460</b>, cows enter separate stalls.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">In an embodiment, the floor of ramp <b>405</b> includes markings or marks which are detectable by the mobile units. For example, a mark may be placed at the center of each stall in ramp <b>130</b>. For example, the mark may be an RF beacon, a specific color, e.g. paint, and the like. A sensor included in sensors <b>330</b> may detect a mark (e.g., by identifying the color of the mark or picking up an RF beacon). Based on identifying the location of the mark, mobile unit may travel to a location defined based on the location of the mark. For example, mobile unit may position itself such that it is right above the mark. For example, a sensor included in sensors <b>330</b> may send controller <b>310</b> the location of a mark (or a relative location with respect to a mobile unit) and controller <b>310</b> may cause motors <b>325</b> to move (e.g., by driving wheels <b>210</b>) a mobile unit to a location that is closest to the mark. It will be understood that various other methods or components for enabling a mobile unit to determine its location in a stall may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">In an embodiment, a marking or mark may be placed within guide <b>410</b>. Accordingly, in order to place a mobile unit right above the mark, controller <b>310</b> may only need to cause the mobile unit to move in one of two directions (e.g., either forwards or backwards). For example, marks placed on the floor of ramp <b>405</b> in guide <b>410</b> and at the centers of stalls may be used by mobile units such as <b>444</b>, <b>445</b> and/or <b>140</b> in order to determine their location with respect to a stall containing the livestock. For example, using a mark as described, a mobile unit may position itself under a cow in a stall.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">As described, a system may include a unit for placing a milking unit in a housing. For example, a system may include an arm <b>425</b> adapted to fetch a milking unit from assembly <b>420</b> (where the milking units may have been washed or otherwise treated) and place the milking units in holders <b>430</b>. It will be understood that holders <b>430</b> may be any suitable housing adapted to house the milking units.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Holders <b>430</b> may be located at a minimal distance from the cow and the location of holder <b>430</b>, e.g., with respect to a center of a stall, may be known. Accordingly, when located right above a mark, e.g., in a center of a stall, a mobile unit may determine the relative location of holders <b>430</b>. Accordingly, a mobile unit may be adapted to determine its location (e.g., in a stall) and, based on its location, determine the location of holders <b>430</b>. Otherwise described, knowing its location in a stall, a mobile unit may readily determine the location of a milking equipment unit housed by holder <b>430</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">In an embodiment, a mobile unit is adapted to detach a milking equipment unit from a housing or holder and attach the milking equipment unit to the dairy livestock. For example, using arm <b>215</b> and gripping unit <b>250</b>, mobile unit <b>140</b> may detach a milking unit (e.g., a teat cup) from holders <b>430</b> and attach the milking unit to a cow. For example, the location of holders <b>430</b> (with respect to a center of a stall) may be known in advance, accordingly, controller <b>310</b> may cause arm <b>215</b> to move to holders <b>430</b> and grip a milking unit. As described, the location and/or shape of an udder may be known to mobile unit <b>140</b> (e.g., based on processing an image of the lower part of cow as described). Accordingly, controller <b>310</b> may cause arm <b>215</b> to move to a location right under an udder and lift teat cups such that they snap onto to the teats (e.g., by force of vacuum in the teat cups as known in the art). It will be noted that when a mobile unit is located right under a cow, the distance an arm of the milking unit needs to travel in order to fetch a milking unit and attached the milking unit to the cow is kept to a minimum. A milking unit may be, for example, a set of four teat cups or it may be one teat cup.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Using marks in stalls as described, a mobile unit may automatically travel from a first stall to a second stall. For example, detecting marks on a floor of ramp <b>130</b> as described, mobile units <b>441</b>, <b>442</b>, <b>443</b>, <b>444</b>, <b>445</b>, <b>446</b>, <b>447</b> and <b>415</b> may travel from a first stall to a second stall. For example, to travel from a first to a second stall, mobile unit <b>442</b> may travel, along guide <b>410</b> until a mark is detected and determined to be right under mobile unit <b>442</b>. Leaving a first stall, a mobile unit may travel, along guide <b>410</b>, till it detects a mark. Detecting a mark on the floor of ramp <b>130</b> may indicate to a mobile unit that it is located in the proper position in a stall. In order to travel from a first stall to a third stall, a mobile unit may continue its motion after detecting a first mark till a second mark is detected.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">As shown by pit <b>435</b>, a system may include a service or maintenance pit where mobile units may be parked and serviced. Other operations may be done when a mobile unit is in pit <b>435</b>, for example, data stored in data storage unit <b>340</b> may be transferred or copied from a mobile unit when in pit <b>435</b>. In an embodiment, management unit <b>470</b> may cause a mobile unit to exit guide <b>410</b> and enter pit <b>435</b>. For example, guide <b>410</b> may include an arrangement similar to a railroad switch or turnout as used in trains. A turnout may be operated by electric motors that may be controlled by management unit <b>470</b> (e.g., using RF or wired communication).</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">Accordingly, by controlling a component of guide <b>410</b>, management unit <b>470</b> may cause a mobile unit to travel to pit <b>435</b>, e.g., as shown by mobile unit <b>441</b>. In an embodiment, management unit <b>470</b> may monitor movements and locations of mobile units <b>441</b>, <b>442</b>, <b>443</b>, <b>444</b>, <b>445</b>, <b>446</b>, <b>447</b> and <b>415</b>. For example, mobile units may report their location to management unit <b>470</b> or other means may be used (e.g., global positioning system components installed in mobile units). Accordingly, management unit <b>470</b> may determine when and how to operate a turnout such that a selected mobile unit travels into the pit.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Mobile units <b>441</b>, <b>442</b>, <b>443</b>, <b>444</b>, <b>445</b>, <b>446</b>, <b>447</b> and <b>415</b> may collaborate and/or cooperate to complete a task, treatment or operation. As known in the art, a milking unit may include four teat cups that need to be attached to the four teats of a cow. In an embodiment, a first mobile unit (e.g., mobile unit <b>443</b>) may be adapted to attach a first portion of a milking unit to the dairy livestock and a second mobile unit (e.g., mobile unit <b>444</b>) may be adapted to attach a second portion of the milking unit to the dairy livestock. For example, mobile unit <b>443</b> may attach a first teat cup, mobile unit <b>444</b> may attach a second teat cup and mobile units <b>445</b> and <b>446</b> may respectively attach the third and fourth teat cups. Mobile unit <b>442</b> may perform preparation related operations, e.g., washing, heating and the like. As described, by processing an image of an udder, the teats in the udder may be identified and their location may be calculated for example using known computer image processing or recognition methods. For example, if the location of mobile unit <b>442</b>, when acquiring an image of an udder, is known, and a location of a camera on arm <b>215</b> is known (e.g., since the location or position of arm <b>215</b> are known) then the location of objects in an image may be calculated. In some embodiments, a video stream may be produced by a camera carried by arm <b>215</b> and controller <b>310</b> may use a video stream to move arm <b>215</b> such that it brings a milking unit to the teats. Any known methods used by robots or other automated systems may be used by mobile units in order to carry and place equipment such as a milking unit at a desired location or position. For example, any methods used by milking robots known in the art may be used by mobile units <b>415</b>, <b>442</b> and <b>443</b>. As noted, unlike milking robots placed outside a stall, in an embodiment, a milking robot may be or may be included in a small mobile units adapted to move to a location under the livestock and perform operations from under the livestock thus minimizing movement of an arm or other parts of the milking robot.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">When a mobile unit completes its task in a current stall it may travel to the next stall, e.g., in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation of ramp <b>405</b>. Prior to moving to the next stall, a mobile unit may determine whether or not another mobile unit is located in the next stall. For example, as described, management unit <b>470</b> may monitor mobile units' locations and may therefore know whether or not mobile unit is located in a specific stall. Accordingly, a mobile unit may communicate with management unit <b>470</b> and be advised whether or not it may move from its current stall to the next stall. In another embodiment, a mobile unit may communicate with adjacent mobile units in order to determine their location and thus determine whether or not it may move into a stall. Accordingly, a mobile unit may automatically travel from a first stall to a second stall based on a command or information received from a management unit <b>470</b> and/or autonomously, based on information received from other mobile units.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">In an embodiment, a plurality of mobile units may be configured to intercommunicate in order to collaborate in performing an action related to treatment of the dairy livestock. Collaboration or cooperation may be realized in various ways. For example, one mobile unit, e.g., mobile unit <b>442</b> that may be the first mobile unit to treat a cow in the current milking session, may be include a camera for obtaining an image of the livestock. The image may be processed, e.g., by management unit <b>470</b> or by one of the mobile units, and a location of an organ of the livestock may be determined and recorded. For example, using an image and provided with the location of the mobile unit that acquired the image, the location of an udder (and/or teats), with respect to a marking in a stall may be determined and recorded. For example, coordinates of an udder or teats, relative to a mark in a stall may be sent to other mobile units. Accordingly, using an image obtained by mobile unit <b>442</b>, mobile units <b>443</b>, <b>444</b>, <b>445</b>, <b>446</b> and <b>447</b> may be informed, in advance, of the location of the udder or teat of the cow.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">One (or more) mobile units in a plurality of mobile units may act as a backup unit. For example, in a typical scenario, mobile units <b>443</b>, <b>444</b>, <b>445</b> and <b>446</b> may each attach one of four teat cups to a cow. For example, after mobile unit <b>443</b> attaches a first teat cup it moves to the next stall and mobile unit <b>444</b> moves to the stall that mobile unit <b>443</b> left. Mobile unit <b>444</b> may then attach the second of four teat cups to the cow. Thus, mobile units may collaborate in attaching a complete milking assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">However, if one of mobile units <b>443</b>, <b>444</b>, <b>445</b> and <b>446</b> fails to attach a teat cup, it may report failure to management unit <b>470</b> (or to other mobile units) and mobile unit <b>447</b>, when acting as a backup unit, may attach a teat cup which another mobile unit failed to attach. Adapted to communicate either with each other or with a central management unit <b>470</b>, mobile units may send and receive any information related to an operation performed by a set of mobile units. Accordingly, one mobile unit may correct errors or failures caused by another mobile unit. For example, a first mobile unit may automatically complete an action which at least one other mobile unit failed to complete as described.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">In an embodiment, each mobile unit in a set of mobile units may be configured to communicate with other mobile units included in the set. A set of mobile units may be configured to dynamically and automatically determine a portion of a treatment to be performed by each of the mobile units in a set. For example, mobile unit <b>444</b> may only move to the next stall if mobile unit <b>443</b> has left that stall. If mobile unit <b>444</b> completes attaching a teat cup as configured and cannot move to the next stall, mobile unit <b>444</b> may attach another teat cup, e.g., one typically attached by mobile unit <b>445</b>. In an embodiment, distribution of sub-tasks may be configured (e.g., each mobile unit is configured to attach one specific teat cup). Mobile units may override a configured distribution of sub-tasks, e.g., a first mobile unit may perform a sub-task that was assigned to a second mobile unit in a configured distribution of sub-tasks.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">Mobile units may send any information to management unit. For example, mobile units may report completion of a sub-task, failure to complete a task or sub-task and the like. Management unit <b>470</b> may be configured to dynamically cause at least some of the mobile units to each perform a portion of a treatment. For example, provided with information from mobile units related to a progress of a treatment (e.g., milking), management unit <b>470</b> may dynamically allocate tasks to mobile units. For example, if mobile unit <b>445</b> reports a malfunction or a failure to attach a teat cup, management unit <b>470</b> may command mobile unit <b>444</b> to âfill inâ for mobile unit <b>443</b>, e.g., attach a teat cup that, per a previous configuration, was to be attached by mobile unit <b>443</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">As described herein, a system and method according to embodiments of the invention may include a mobile unit adapted to travel on a ramp, e.g., a ramp in a milking parlour (or parlor). For example, in an embodiment, a mobile unit (e.g., mobile unit <b>140</b>) can travel between the legs of a cow in a stall and park itself below the cow. The mobile unit may then perform any operation as described herein, e.g., attach a milking unit, wash or disinfect the udder of the cow etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">In an embodiment, the ramp may be a round, rotating ramp or platform. In an embodiment, the ramp includes a holder for a milking equipment unit. A holder may be located as close as possible to a cow in a stall such that the distance from the holder to an udder of a cow in the stall is minimal. Accordingly, when a mobile unit is parked under the cow, an arm of the mobile unit may only need to extend to relatively short distances in order to fetch a milking unit from a holder and attach the milking unit to the cow.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">In an embodiment, mobile units may collaborate or cooperate to perform a task. For example, an exemplary task may be attaching four teat cups of a milking unit to a cow. To complete the exemplary task, a first mobile unit (e.g., mobile unit <b>442</b>) may attach a first teat cup, a second mobile unit (e.g., mobile unit <b>443</b>) may attach a second teat cup and so on.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">A plurality of mobile units may dynamically cause at least some of the mobile units to each perform a portion of a treatment. For example, if mobile unit <b>442</b> failed to attach the first teat cup it may (e.g., using its Rx/Tx unit <b>335</b>) inform mobile unit <b>443</b> of the failure and mobile unit <b>443</b> may attach the first teat cup and a second teat cup. Accordingly, a mobile unit may be adapted to automatically complete an action which at least one other mobile unit failed to complete.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">As discussed, mobile unit <b>447</b> may be informed by any other mobile unit in system <b>400</b> of a failure to complete a task and may perform the task. For example, mobile unit <b>447</b> may attach a teat cup which mobile unit <b>446</b> failed to attach. In an embodiment, central management unit <b>470</b> may dynamically or automatically allocate tasks. For example, each of mobile units <b>415</b>, <b>442</b>, <b>443</b>, <b>444</b>, <b>445</b>, <b>446</b> and <b>447</b> may report to management unit <b>470</b> upon successful completion of a task and/or upon failure to complete a task. Accordingly, management unit <b>470</b> may be aware of progress of a task and may allocate or re-allocate sub-tasks to mobile units. For example, a task that includes four sub-tasks may be attaching four teat cups to a cow where attaching any one of the four teat cups is a sub-task. In such exemplary task, management unit <b>470</b> may dynamically cause any of mobile units <b>443</b>, <b>444</b>,<b>445</b>, <b>446</b> and <b>447</b> to attach one or more teat cups.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">A movement of a mobile unit from one stall to another may be synchronized or based on a movement of another mobile unit. For example, when mobile unit has finished washing the cow in its current stall it may move to the next stall and inform mobile unit <b>443</b> that it may move to the stall which mobile unit <b>442</b> just left. In another embodiment, mobile unit <b>442</b> reports to management unit <b>470</b> that it has finished its tasks in the current stall and may request permission from management unit <b>470</b> to move to the next stall. Management unit <b>470</b> may keep track of the location of all mobile units in system <b>400</b> (e.g., based on reports from the mobile units as described). Accordingly, management unit <b>470</b> may determine whether or not a mobile unit may move to the next stall (e.g., by determining no other mobile unit is present in the next stall).</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">Mobile units and management unit <b>470</b> may share information. For example, an image taken by mobile unit <b>442</b> (that may be the first unit to treat a cow in a milking session) may be shared by all mobile units in system <b>400</b>. Data (e.g., coordinates of teats in an udder) determined based on an image taken by one of the mobile units may be shared by all units. For example, management unit <b>470</b> may receive an image from mobile unit <b>442</b>, determine, based on the image, the location of the cow teats with respect to the stall or with respect to a known location within a stall, and provide the coordinates to mobile units <b>442</b>, <b>443</b>, <b>444</b>,<b>445</b>, <b>446</b> and <b>447</b>.</p>
