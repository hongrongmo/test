    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">The present invention relates to ENOblock, which is a non-substrate analogue having an enolase inhibitory activity, and a pharmaceutical composition for preventing or treating cancer or enolase-associated diseases, containing the same. The ENOblock of the present invention directly binds to enolase so as to inhibit an activity thereof, and the inhibition is more effective in hypoxia than in normoxia. In addition, the ENOblock of the present invention inhibits migration, metastasis and invasion of cancer cells. Furthermore, the ENOblock of the present invention induces glucose uptake into cells, down-regulates the expression of PEPCK, and inhibits adipogenesis and foam cell formation. Therefore, a composition containing the ENOblock of the present invention can be very effectively applied to prevent or treat cancer or enolase-associated diseases.</p>

      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Enolase is a component of the glycolysis pathway and a “moonlighting” protein, with important roles in diverse cellular processes that are not related to its function in glycolysis. However, small molecule tools to probe enolase function have been restricted to crystallography or enzymology. In this study, we report the discovery of the small molecule “ENOblock”, which is the first, nonsubstrate analogue that directly binds to enolase and inhibits its activity. ENOblock was isolated by small molecule screening in a cancer cell assay to detect cytotoxic agents that function in hypoxic conditions, which has previously been shown to induce drug resistance. Further analysis revealed that ENOblock can inhibit cancer cell metastasis in vivo. Moreover, an unexpected role for enolase in glucose homeostasis was revealed by in vivo analysis. Thus, ENOblock is the first reported enolase inhibitor that is suitable for biological assays. This new chemical tool may also be suitable for further study as a cancer and diabetes drug candidate.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Glycolysis is an ancient and highly conserved metabolic pathway that converts 1 mol of glucose into 2 mol of pyruvate. Free energy is released and used to form the highenergy-containing compounds adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Glycolysis comprises 10 biochemical reactions, and each step is catalyzed and regulated by a different enzyme. Over the past 20 years, there has been increasing appreciation of the multiple roles glycolytic enzymes play in diverse cellular processes (reviewed in ref 1).</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Cancer cells show increased dependence on glycolysis to produce ATP; a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect.<sup>2 </sup>This metabolic alteration is a fundamental difference between cancer cells and normal cells, offering a therapeutic strategy to selectively kill cancer cells using glycolysis inhibitors (reviewed in ref 3). It has also been shown that glycolysis inhibitors induce cancer cell death more effectively in a hypoxic environment, which occurs within developing tumors.<sup>4 </sup>Moreover, this hypoxic environment renders cancer cells less sensitive to other cancer drugs, such as cytarabine and doxorubicin.<sup>4 </sup></p>

        <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. Discovery of compound AP-III-a4 (ENOblock). (a) Schematic of the screening system used to detect apoptosis inducers effective under hypoxia. HCT116 cancer cells were seeded in parallel 96-well culture plates. Hypoxia was induced in one plate using 150 μM cobalt chloride treatment. Triazine library compound at 5 μM concentration was added 4 h later, and cell death was determined 24 h after hypoxia induction. “Hit” compounds induced 25% or greater levels of cell death under hypoxia compared to normoxia (as measured by MTT assay absorbance). (b) Chemical structures of AP-III-a4 (ENOblock) and the control compounds, AP-IV-e3 and AP-I-f10. Chemical structures of GAPDS, which targets glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and rosiglitazone, a well-known anti-diabetes drug, are also shown. (c) ENOblock induced higher levels of HCT116 colon cancer cell death in hypoxic conditions (Hypox) compared to normoxia (Norm). Error=SD; *=P value&lt;0.05 for increased cell death compared to normoxia. P value: hypox 10=1.23×10<sup>−6</sup>; hypox 5=2.38×10<sup>−6</sup>; hypox 2.5=1.16×10<sup>−5</sup>; hypox 1.25=0.000334. (d) Representative phase contrast microscopic images of HCT116 colon cancer cells treated with ENOblock under normoxia or hypoxia.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. Treatment of HCT115 cancer cells with 150 μM CoCl<sub>2 </sub>for 4 h produced a hypoxic environment, as shown by increased expression of the hypoxia-responsive gene, enolase. In contrast, a different protein from the glycolysis pathway, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) did not show increased expression after inducing hypoxia, which is consistent with previous report (Said, et al, BMC Mol Biol. 8: 55(2007).

        <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. Discovery that compound AP-III-a4 (ENOblock) is a direct inhibitor of enolase. (a) Affinity chromatography study for ENOblock in HCT116 cancer cells. Protein bands marked “a” and “b” were identified by mass spectrometry as subunits of the heterodimer, enolase. In contrast, mass spectrometry failed to identify the other prominent protein bands in the eluate from the ENOblock affinity matrix. Control matrix=AP-IV-e3 (2) affinity matrix, which showed no binding to HCT116 lysate proteins. (b) Sequence identification for the enolase monomer subunit. Identified peptides are shown in red. Mascot scores above 100 were deemed to be significant. (c) Western blot analysis confirmed that enolase in HCT116 cancer cell lysate binds to the ENOblock affinity matrix. Competition analysis using free ENOblock (abbreviated as ENO) as a competitor completely inhibited enolase binding to the ENOblock affinity matrix. Twenty micrograms of cell lysate from YD-10B oral cancer cells or Huh7 hepatocytes were used as positive controls. (d) Western blot analysis confirmed that purified human enolase binds to the ENOblock affinity matrix. Competition analysis using free ENOblock as a competitor inhibited purified enolase binding to the ENOblock affinity matrix. In contrast, the APIV-e3 control compound affinity matrix could not bind to the purified enolase. As a positive control, ENOblock affinity matrix was incubated with 200 μg of HCT 116 cell lysate; 50 μg cell lysate from HCT116 cancer cells was used as a positive control for the enolase antibody. (e) ENOblock dose-dependently inhibited the activity of purified enolase. ENOblock inhibited enolase activity at a markedly lower concentration than the wellknown enolase inhibitor, sodium fluoride (NaF); 2.5 μM ENOblock treatment reduced enolase activity to a level as approximated with 1 mM NaF treatment. Error=SD; *=P&lt;0.05 compared to the untreated group. P value: Fluoride 0.5 mM=0.007708; Fluoride 1 mM=0.000543; Fluoride 2 mM=0.000376; EnoBlock 2.5 μM=0.000527; EnoBlock 5 μM=0.000474; EnoBlock 10 μM=0.000335.</p>

Cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay 24 h later. Increasing concentrations of ENO1 cytotoxicity under hypoxia compared to normoxia. Error=SD; *=P&lt;0.05 compared to normoxia.

      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0073">We developed a novel, dual screening system to identify molecules that preferentially kill cancer cells in a hypoxic environment (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>). A small molecule library of 384 triazines prepared on a solid support5 (5; <figref>FIG. 3</figref>) was screened. A “hit” molecule was defined as an inducer of at least 25% increased cancer cell toxicity in hypoxia compared to normoxia (as determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a tetrazole (MTT) assay). Five from 384 triazines screened produced greater cancer cell toxicity under hypoxia. The best performing hit molecule was AP-III-a4(1; <figref>FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>). AP-III-a4 treatment of cancer cells cultured under hypoxia reduced cell viability dose-dependently (<figref>FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>-<b>1</b><i>d</i>).</p>
      <heading id="h-00018-en" level="2">ENOblock Binds to Enolase and Inhibits Its Activity.</heading>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0074">Affinity chromatography was used to identify the cellular target for AP-III-a4. Target identification strategies for the triazine library used in this study are relatively straightforward, because the molecules contain a built-in linker moiety. This allows conjugation to an affinity matrix with reduced risk of compromising biological activity. Silver staining of proteins eluted from the AP-III-a4 affinity matrix is shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that two protein bands of approximately 45 kD mass were subunits of enolase, a glycolysis enzyme, and a protein band of approximately 40 kD was actin (<figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>). Thus, we renamed molecule AP-IIIa4 “ENOblock”. ENOblock binding to enolase in cancer cell lysates was confirmed by Western blot analysis of proteins eluted from the ENOblock affinity matrix. Competition analysis with free ENOblock inhibited enolase binding to the ENOblock affinity matrix (<figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>). Moreover, ENOblock could bind to purified human enolase, suggesting a direct interaction between ENOblock and enolase (<figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>d</i>). Subsequent analysis showed that enolase activity can be inhibited by ENOblock dose-dependently (<figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>e</i>). As an additional control, we also tested another non-hit compound from the tagged triazine library, AP-I-f10 (3), which was shown to not reduce enolase activity (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>). To test that ENOblock treatment under hypoxia induced cytotoxicity, rather than inhibition of cell proliferation, siRNA-mediated enolase knock-down HCT1167 cancer cells were stained with trypan blue (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>). ENOblock-treated cells showed increased trypan blue uptake under hypoxia, which confirmed the induction of cell death.</p>
      <heading id="h-00019-en" level="2">ENOblock Inhibits Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion.</heading>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0075">Enolase is a “moonlighting” metabolic enzyme, because it performs multiple functions that are unrelated to its innate glycolytic function.7,8 Thus, we speculated that ENOblock represents a powerful chemical tool to characterize the moonlighting functions of enolase. As our first test, we assessed the role of enolase in cancer progression (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>). We found that enolase inhibition by ENOblock can reduce cancer cell invasion, which to our knowledge is the first confirmation that enolase activity is linked to metastasis (<figref>FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<b>7</b><i>b</i>). As an additional control, we also tested another compound from the tagged triazine library, AP-I-f10 (3), which did not reduce cell invasion (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>). Moreover, ENOblock treatment also inhibited cancer cell migration (<figref>FIGS. 7</figref><i>c</i>-<b>7</b><i>d</i>). ENOblock treatment reduced cancer cell invasion/migration under normoxia at concentrations that do not induce cytotoxicity (compare <figref>FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<b>7</b><i>b</i>, with <figref>FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>). Previous studies have shown that enolase expression knockdown can increase cytotoxicity induced by the cancer drugs taxol and vincristine.9 In accordance with this finding, we observed that ENOblock treatment could also increase cancer cell cytotoxicity induced by taxol and vincristine (<figref>FIG. 7</figref><i>e</i>). To investigate how ENOblock may induce cancer cell cytotoxicity, we measured the expression of two proteins that are linked to the induction of apoptosis, AKT10 and Bcl-xL.11 ENOblock treatment decreased the expression of AKT and BclxL (<figref>FIG. 7</figref><i>f</i>).</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0076">The zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) cancer cell xenograft model is gaining increasing research prominence as a validated, convenient tool for testing candidate cancer drugs in vivo.<sup>10,11 </sup>In addition, zebrafish is a relevant vertebrate platform for predicting toxicological effects in mammals.<sup>12 </sup>We observed that 10 μM ENOblock treatment of developing zebrafish larvae was nontoxic (<figref>FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>-<b>9</b><i>c</i>). Employing a recently published zebrafish tumor xenograft model validated for anticancer drug testing,<sup>10 </sup>we observed that ENOblock treatment reduced cancer cell dissemination, suggesting an inhibition of cancer cell migration and invasion processes (<figref>FIG. 9</figref><i>d</i>).</p>
      <heading id="h-00020-en" level="2">ENOblock Induces Cellular Glucose Uptake and Down-regulates PEPCK Expression.</heading>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0077">Interestingly, ENOblock (compound AP-III-a4) was among a group of triazines previously identified in a screen to discover novel modulators of glucose uptake,<sup>13 </sup>although the mechanism of action was not characterized in that study. Thus, we confirmed the ability of ENOblock to increase glucose uptake in cells, using the fluorescent probe 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG)<sup>14</sup>, which can be used to monitor cellular glucose flux (<figref>FIG. 10</figref><i>a</i>). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that modulation of enolase function is linked to increased glucose uptake. The role of enolase in promoting cellular glucose uptake was confirmed by siRNA-mediated knock-down of enolase expression (<figref>FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0078">To characterize the mechanism by which ENOblock promotes glucose uptake, we assessed the expression of key enzymes linked to glucose homeostasis. We found that ENOblock down-regulates the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in hepatocytes, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of liver tissue gluconeogenesis,<sup>15 </sup>the process whereby glucose is synthesized (<figref>FIG. 9</figref><i>b</i>). Of note, there is a precedent for the finding that small molecule regulation of a glycolysis enzyme regulates glucose uptake, with the report that GAPDS (4) targets glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) to promote glucose uptake (GAPDH catalyzes the sixth step of glycolysis, upstream of enolase).<sup>16 </sup>Thus, we also measured PEPCK expression in hepatocytes after treatment with GAPDS or rosiglitazone (5), a well-known diabetes drug that can down-regulate PEPCK expression.<sup>17 </sup>It was found that rosiglitazone can down-regulate PEPCK expression, while GAPDS had no effect, suggesting that GAPDS and ENOblock promote glucose uptake by different cellular mechanisms (<figref>FIG. 10</figref><i>b</i>). Interestingly, the kidney is also a site of gluconeogenesis,<sup>18 </sup>and it was observed that ENOblock treatment could also down-regulate PEPCK expression in kidney cells (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>c</i>). In contrast, treatment of kidney cells with GAPDS, rosiglitazone, or insulin did not affect PEPCK expression (<figref>FIG. 10</figref><i>c</i>). The enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase (G6 Pase) catalyzes the final step in gluconeogenesis plays a key role in the homeostatic regulation of glucose uptake by the liver.<sup>19 </sup>We observed that ENOblock treatment of hepatocytes did not influence G6 Pase expression, which was also observed after treatment with GAPDS or rosiglitazone (<figref>FIG. 10</figref><i>d</i>). The enzyme 5′ AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key role in cellular energy homeostasis.<sup>20 </sup>Similar to G6 Pase, we observed that treatment of hepatocytes with ENOblock, GAPDS, or rosiglitazone did not affect AMPK expression (<figref>FIG. 10</figref><i>d</i>).</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0000">ENOblock Down-regulates PEPCK Expression and induces Glucose Uptake in Vivo.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0079">To investigate the effects of ENOblock on glucose homeostasis in vivo, we selected the zebrafish, because this animal model provides a convenient, rapid experimental format requiring small amounts of test compound. Moreover, it has been shown that zebrafish and mammals share similar glucose regulatory responses.<sup>17,21 </sup>Adult zebrafish treated with ENOblock or rosiglitazone showed down-regulated hepatic PEPCK expression (<figref>FIGS. 12</figref><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>b</i>), which confirmed our cell-based findings. The fluorescent glucose probe 2-NBDG has been used to assess glucose uptake in zebrafish larvae, which are transparent and allow visualization of 2-NBDG fluorescence (e.g., ref 22). We observed that ENOblock treatment induced glucose uptake in zebrafish larvae (<figref>FIGS. 12</figref><i>c</i>-<b>12</b><i>d</i>). As a comparison, we also tested the effect of emodin (6-methyl-1,3,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone, a biologically active plant constituent that is known to promote cellular glucose uptake; 23). Fluorescence microscopy analysis of 2-NBDG treated larvae showed that emodin treatment increased glucose uptake (<figref>FIG. 12</figref><i>e</i>). 2-NBDG uptake was quantified by measuring 2-NBDG fluorescence intensity in the zebrafish larvae eye at 72 hpf, because this tissue has been show to express a relatively large number of glucose transporter isoforms at this stage of development.<sup>24 </sup>Image J anaylsis (National Institutes of Health, USA) confirmed that ENOblock or emodin treatment could promote glucose uptake in the zebrafish. 2-NBDG fluorescent signal in lysed larvae was measured using a fluorescent plate reader (<figref>FIG. 13</figref>). Results from this approach confirmed that ENOblock treatment induced glucose uptake in vivo.</p>

      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0080">Commonly prescribed drugs for patients with diabetes are associated with side effects, such as weight gain or cardiovascular events.<sup>25 </sup>Thus, we tested the effect of ENOblock on lipid accumulation in differentiating adipocyte precursor cells, which provides a convenient test for novel anti-obesity agents.<sup>26 </sup>The positive effect of rosiglitazone on adipogenesis has already been described.<sup>27 </sup>In contrast, we observed that ENOblock treatment inhibited lipid accumulation in adipocyte precursor cells exposed to adipogenic factors (<figref>FIG. 14</figref><i>a</i>). Foam cell differentiation from macrophages adhered to blood vessel walls is a crucial step in the progression of atherosclerosis.<sup>28 </sup>ENOblock treatment inhibited lipid accumulation in macrophages induced to undergo foam cell differentiation (<figref>FIG. 14</figref><i>b</i>). Cell counting showed that ENOblock treatment inhibited both foam cell differentiation from macrophages and macrophage differentiation from monocytes (<figref>FIGS. 14</figref><i>c</i>-<b>14</b><i>d</i>). These inhibitory effects of ENOblock were observed at treatment concentrations that did not induce cytotoxicity (<figref>FIG. 14</figref><i>e</i>).</p>
      <heading id="h-00022-en" level="2">Further Study</heading>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0081">In this study, we describe a new small molecule, ENOblock, which is the first nonsubstrate analogue that directly binds to enolase and can be used as a probe to characterize enolase activity in biological systems. Enolase is a metalloenzyme that catalyzes the dehydration of 2-phospho-D-glycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, which is the ninth and penultimate step of glycolysis.<sup>6 </sup>Enolase also performs multiple functions that are unrelated to its innate glycolytic function.<sup>1,6 </sup>To our knowledge, small molecule tools to clarify the diverse roles of enolase are rare. The most widely reported enolase inhibitor is phosphonoacetohydroxamate (PhAH). PhAH is thought to mimic the aci-carboxylate form of the intermediate carbanion in the reaction and is only applicable for crystallographic studies (e.g., ref 29, 30). Another two substrate analogues were developed, but these were only applied for direct spectrophotometric titration of the enolase active site and stopped-flow studies of enzyme kinetics (D-tartronate semialdehyde phosphate<sup>34 </sup>and 3-aminoenolpyruvate phosphate<sup>31,32</sup>). Moreover, these substrate analogues are not commercially available. Inorganic sodium fluoride is also a substrate competitor for enolase. However, fluoride is not suitable for studying enolase in biological systems due to a variety of nonspecific toxic effects, such as phosphatase inhibition and the induction of increased oxidative stress or perturbed antioxidant defense mechanisms.<sup>36,37 </sup>A recent report described the malaria drug mefloquine as an enolase inhibitor in <i>Schistosoma mansoni.</i><sup>34 </sup>However, mefloquine could not directly bind to recombinant enolase from this parasite and could not inhibit purified enolase activity. This suggests that, unlike ENOblock, mefloquine may not bind to enolase directly but exerts its effects via interacting with an uncharacterized enolase-modulating molecule in the cell extract. For example, it has been shown that enolase can bind to vacuoles or form large macromolecular complexes associated with mitochondria.<sup>34 </sup>Thus, we propose that ENOblock is a powerful chemical tool to characterize the various, nonglycolytic ‘moonlighting’<sup>35 </sup>functions of enolase.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0082">When discussing the activity of ENOblock, we believe that it is important to differentiate between the effects of this compound in hypoxic or normoxic conditions. We discovered ENOblock by screening for compounds that can induce greater levels of cancer cell death under hypoxia compared to normoxia. We adopted this approach because common cancer chemotherapy drugs are less effective under hypoxia.4 Our demonstration that enolase expression is rapidly up-regulated after the onset of hypoxia (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>) links the ability of ENOblock to kill cancer cells under hypoxia and its enolase inhibitory activity. Moreover, cancer cells are characterized by the Warburg effect, which is a group of metabolic alterations that increase reliance on anaerobic glycolysis for energy generation.<sup>2 </sup>Thus, glycolysis inhibitors, such as 3-bromopyruvate and 6-aminonicotinamide, can kill cancer cells (reviewed in ref 3). In our study, we have shown that ENOblock selectively kills cancer cells under hypoxia (<figref>FIGS. 1</figref><i>c</i>-<b>1</b><i>d</i>), which is due to the glycolysis-related function of enolase (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0083">The multifunctional roles of enolase can also be probed using ENOblock under normoxia. For example, enolase is exported to the eukaryote cell surface via a nonclassical export pathway, and it has been suggested that enolase can mediate cancer cell invasion leading to metastasis.<sup>36,37 </sup>We observed that ENOblock treatment of cancer cells under normoxia, at concentrations that are noncytotoxic, inhibited cancer cell invasion and migration (<figref>FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<b>7</b><i>d</i>). This finding suggests that ENOblock can also target cell-surface-bound enolase to modulate cancer cell metastasis. Our in vivo analysis of ENOblock treatment on metastasis was also carried out under normoxia, which showed that ENOblock can prevent cancer cell metastasis without noticeably affecting cancer cell viability (<figref>FIGS. 9</figref><i>d</i>-<b>9</b><i>e</i>; the cancer cells appear to be retained at the injection site without any reduction in cell numbers). Moreover, enolase has been shown to be associated with the cell microtubule system, which may negatively affect the efficacy of cancer drugs that disrupt microtubules.<sup>7,38 </sup>Our results show that ENOblock treatment can increase the ability of microtubule-destabilizing drugs to kill cancer cells (<figref>FIG. 7</figref><i>e</i>). Therefore, we speculate that ENOblock warrants further studies to assess its potential as a drug candidate for cancer therapy, because it can inhibit cancer cell metastasis and synergize with microtubule-destabilizing drugs under normoxia, while also possessing the potential to selectively kill cancer cells in hypoxic niches within tumors (cancer stem cells have been shown to express hypoxia-inducible factors that promote their survival under hypoxia (reviewed in ref 39).</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0084">Our study has also shown that enolase inhibition by ENOblock can induce cellular glucose uptake (<figref>FIG. 10</figref><i>a</i>). Our results indicate that the ability of ENOblock to increase glucose uptake is due to a reduction of PEPCK expression. PEPCK expression has also been shown to be inhibited by insulin.<sup>40 </sup>PEPCK inhibition in the liver reduces gluconeogenesis and concomitantly promotes glucose uptake.<sup>15,41 </sup>Interestingly, gluconeogenesis in the kidney also plays a significant role in regulating blood glucose levels,<sup>18 </sup>and our results show that ENOblock, but not insulin or the diabetes drug, rosiglitazone, can inhibit PEPCK expression in kidney cells (<figref>FIG. 10</figref><i>c</i>). In addition, we have shown that enolase knock-down by siRNA can also induce glucose uptake (<figref>FIG. 15</figref>). Our demonstration that ENOblock treatment can inhibit PEPCK expression in vivo and induce glucose uptake suggests that ENOblock may be suitable for further studies to assess its potential as an anti-diabetes drug candidate. In support of this, is can be noted that enolase expression is increased in diabetic patients compared to normal subjects.<sup>42 </sup>Moreover, our results suggest that ENOblock inhibits some of the complications associated with the use of diabetes drugs, such as increased adipogenesis and foam cell formation (<figref>FIG. 14</figref>). Insulin signaling is linked to accelerated foam cell formation,<sup>43 </sup>and commonly prescribed diabetes drugs can induce adipogenesis or weight gain.<sup>27 </sup>We believe that the ability of ENOblock to inhibit foam cell formation or adipogenesis further supports the potential of ENOblock to be developed as an anti-diabetic drug candidate. Interestingly, the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug, metformin, also inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis and is currently the subject of various clinical trials as an anticancer drug (reviewed in ref 44).</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0085">To our knowledge, this study provides the first link between enolase inhibition and down-regulation of PEPCK expression, which inhibits gluconeogenesis. However, a precedent for this relationship exists in Nature. Studies in the mold <i>Aspergillus nidulans </i>have shown that, unexpectedly, mutation of the acuN gene (which encodes enolase) induces growth inhibition on gluconeogenic but not glycolytic carbon sources.<sup>45 </sup>Therefore, we believe that further studies are warranted to assess the possible regulatory roles that other glycolysis enzymes exert over gluconeogenesis in mammals.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0086">The in vivo analyses of ENOblock treatment presented herein have utilized the zebrafish vertebrate model. Zebrafish possess considerable advantages as the primary animal for testing novel therapeutic agents, such as (a) glucose homeostatic mechanisms that are conserved in mammals, (b) the availability of a validated cancer drug testing system, (c) toxicological responses that correlate with mammalian tests, and (d) the needs for relatively small amounts of test compound.<sup>10,12,17,21,46 </sup>In addition, highly detailed studies of mammalian cell behavior can be carried out in zebrafish (e.g. ref 47). Therefore, we believe that our series of zebrafish-based analyses are a suitable format for the first report of ENOblock activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0087">In summary, our study reports the small molecule ENOblock, which is the first nonsubstrate analogue inhibitor that directly binds to enolase and can be used to probe the various nonglycolytic functions of this enzyme. We have utilized ENOblock to assess the effect of enolase inhibition on cancer progression and show for the first time that enolase inhibition can reduce cancer cell metastasis in vivo. We also show for the first time that enolase inhibition can suppress the gluconeogenesis regulator PEPCK and is a new target for developing antidiabetic drugs. We believe that the discovery of ENOblock is a testament to the power of forward chemical genetics to provide new chemical probes, drug targets, and candidate therapeutics for previously uncharacterized cellular mechanisms regulating human disease. In light of the potential role of enolase in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections (such as <i>Yersinia pestis, Borrelia </i>spp., and <i>Streptococcus pneumonia</i>) and trypanosomatid parasites (reviewed in ref 48), in addition to the need to discover new glycolysis inhibitors for cancer therapy, we believe that ENOblock has the potential to make significant contributions to our understanding of these disorders.</p>
