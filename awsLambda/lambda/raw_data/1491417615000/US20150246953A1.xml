The full disclosure of the priority application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.</p>

      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">
        <i>Mycoplasma </i>are a genus of bacteria and represent the smallest known cell with a diameter of about 0.1 micron (Î¼m). <i>Mycoplasma </i>lack a cell wall and as such, they are unaffected by many common antibiotics such as penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis. Several species are pathogenic in humans, including <i>M. genitalium</i>, which is believed to be involved in pelvic inflammatory diseases, and <i>M. pneumoniae</i>, which is an important cause of atypical pneumonia and other respiratory disorders. <i>Mycoplasma penetrans </i>is another pathogenic species infecting humans, typically by penetration into cells of the urogenital and respiratory tracts.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Multiple myeloma is the malignant proliferation of plasma cells involving more than 10 percent of the bone marrow. Bone pain related to multiple lytic lesions is the most common clinical presentation. However, up to 30 percent of patients are diagnosed incidentally while being evaluated for unrelated problems, and one third of patients are diagnosed after a pathologic fracture, commonly of the axial skeleton. In multiple myeloma, plasma cell clones produce an excess of monoclonal antibody (M proteins) and free light chain proteins. The M proteins may be recognized as IgA, IgD, IgG, IgE or IgM, depending on their heavy chain class. This excess of M proteins is responsible for the hyperviscosity syndrome, which interferes with fibrin aggregation and platelet function. The monoclonal immunoglobulins may be identified on serum or urine protein electrophoresis.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Multiple myeloma must be differentiated from other causes of monoclonal gammopathy, including monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). About 3% of the world's population has a monoclonal gamopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which is a benign but obligatory precursor to multiple myeloma where the immunoglobulin produced by the cells responsible for the MGUS syndrome is identical to that of the myeloma cells. MGUS has a myeloma progression risk of 1% per year.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Multiple myeloma is treated with chemotherapeutic agents that are often initially effective, only for the blood malignancy to return months or years later. Accordingly, many patients go through four, five or even more rounds of potent drug treatment to reduce the mounting myeloma cells, while suffering increasing drug side effects.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Therefore, a need exists for methods of treating MGUS and/or preventing the progression of MGUS to multiple myeloma, as well as additional therapeutics for treating multiple myeloma and treating or preventing <i>Mycoplasma </i>infection.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present invention is based on the discovery described herein that a majority of monoclonal immunoglobulins (Ig) from the sera of 80 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or frank multiple myeloma (MM), show highly selective reactivity with an antigen from human <i>Mycoplasma genitalium </i>and <i>Mycoplasma penetrans</i>.

In particular embodiments, the patient or subject has a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In some embodiments of the above methods, macrolides such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, and telithromycin, or quinolones, such as moxifloxacin, or any ribosomal targeted antibiotics are used as an agent effective to treat a <i>Mycoplasma </i>infection. In particular embodiments, erythromycin, clarithromycin or azithromycin are used.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In some embodiments, plasma from the patient or subject contains immunoglobulin that binds an antigen from human <i>Mycoplasma</i>. In particular embodiments, the human <i>Mycoplasma </i>is <i>Mycoplasma genitalium </i>or <i>Mycoplasma penetrans</i>.

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">A majority of monoclonal immunoglobulins (Ig) from the sera of 80 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or frank multiple myeloma (MM), show highly selective reactivity with an antigen from human <i>Mycoplasma genitalium </i>and <i>Mycoplasma penetrans</i>. Moreover, some human mycoplasmas produced a protein that bound to immunoglobulins with high affinity and it was unrelated to other proteins in the protein database. This protein, MG281, when bound to immunoglobulins, blocks reactivity of the antibody with its cognate antigen. It, as well as organisms that produced it, were mitogenic for primary human B-cells. In keeping with the nomenclature of other proteins from microorganisms that bind to immunoglobulins, the protein is also referenced as Protein M.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The binding specificity showed that MG281 protein had the properties of a class of non-specific immunoglobulin binding proteins, sometimes referred to as B-cell super antigens. The immunoglobulin reactivity with this protein was independent of germ line usage or CDR3 sequences in antibody molecules. The sera from normal donors reacted with the same mycoplasm proteins as the myeloma paraproteins, indicating that the ability of human immunoglobulins to react with <i>mycoplasma </i>proteins was not confined to those produced in multiple myeloma. Proteomics analysis showed that the isolated protein was about 556 amino acids long and contained a 16-36 amino acid transmembrane domain. Therefore, this invention provides a novel protein, MG281, also referenced as Protein M.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">There are provided herein methods of alleviating the symptoms of multiple myeloma in a patient or subject in need thereof, methods of treating multiple myeloma in a patient or subject, and methods of preventing development of multiple myeloma in a patient at risk thereof, which methods include administering an agent effective to treat a <i>Mycoplasma </i>infection. Such methods may further include treating the patient with conventional chemotherapeutic agents used in treating multiple myeloma.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Multiple myeloma is currently treated with drugs such as dexamethasone, melphalan hydrochloride, thalidomide, lenalidomide, bortezomib, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, or vincristine, and combinations thereof. Two classes of drug that became available in the past decade (i.e., proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulators) have been far more effective than any previous drugs against this form of cancer. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and two immunomodulatory drugs, thalidomide and lenalidomide are available, with additional drugs currently in clinical trials. Carfilzomib and ONX0912 (Onyx Pharmaceuticals), MLN9708 (Millenium Pharmaceuticals), CEP-18770 (Cephalon), and NPI-0052 (Nereus Pharmaceuticals) are additional proteasome inhibitors in various stages of development (Appel, A., Nature 480:S40-S42, 2011). Pomalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug currently under development for treatment of multiple myeloma (Appel, A., <i>Nature </i>480:S40-S42, 2011). Accordingly, the invention methods of treatment of MGUS or multiple myeloma may include any of these chemotherapeutic agents. In some embodiments the chemotherapeutic agents are selected from the group consisting of dexamethasone, melphalan hydrochloride, thalidomide, lenalidomide, bortezomib, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In some embodiments of the present methods, agents effective to treat <i>Mycoplasma </i>infection include antibiotics and vaccines. <i>Mycoplasma </i>are a genus of bacteria that lack a cell wall and thus, they are unaffected by many common antibiotics such as penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis. However, a number of different antibiotics have been used to treat <i>Mycoplasma </i>infections. Macrolides such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, and telithromycin may be used for treatment of <i>Mycoplasma </i>infections. In some embodiments, erythromycin, clarithromycin or azithromycin are used. Macrolides, in particular azithromycin, as well as the newer quinolones, such as moxifloxacin, also have good activity against <i>M. genitalium </i>(Ross and Jensen, <i>Sex Transm Infect </i>82:269-271, 2006). Accordingly, any of the above exemplary drugs as well as other known drugs for treating human <i>Mycoplasma </i>infection may be used in the present methods as agents effective to treat <i>Mycoplasma </i>infection.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The term âsubjectâ as used herein refers to any individual or patient to which the subject methods are performed. Generally the subject is human, although as will be appreciated by those in the art, the subject may be an animal. Thus, other animals, including mammals such as rodents (including mice, rats, hamsters and guinea pigs), cats, dogs, rabbits, farm animals including cows, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, etc., and primates (including monkeys, chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas) are included within the definition of subject. In preferred embodiments, the subject is human.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Also provided herein are isolated binding compounds containing at least one antibody light chain variable region having complementarity determining region (CDR) sequences present in the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 4, 5, and 6; and at least one antibody heavy chain variable region having CDR sequences present in the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 8, 9, and 10; wherein the antibody or binding fragment thereof binds MG281 protein from <i>Mycoplasma genitalium </i>or <i>Mycoplasma penetrans</i>. Such binding compounds include antibodies and antibody fragments.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The terms âantibodyâ (Ab) and âimmunoglobulinâ (Ig) are used interchangeably herein and refer to a large generally Y-shaped protein produced by B-cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses. Antibodies are typically made of basic structural unitsâeach with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains, and several different kinds of antibodies, which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess. There are five types of mammalian Ig heavy chain, which defines the class of antibody, and are denoted by the Greek letters: Î±, Î´, Îµ, Î³, and Î¼, found in IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM antibodies, respectively. Each heavy chain has two regions, the constant region and the variable region. The constant region is identical in all antibodies of the same isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. The variable region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, but is the same for all antibodies produced by a single B cell or B cell clone. In mammals there are two types of immunoglobulin light chain, which are called lambda (X) and kappa (K). A light chain has two successive domains: one constant domain and one variable domain. Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell, and a membrane-bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells, or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure to the antigen. Secreted antibodies are produced by plasma cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">As used herein, the term âantibodyâ refers to any form of antibody that exhibits the desired biological activity. Thus, it is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers, but is not limited to, monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multi-specific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies). As used herein, the term âantibody fragmentâ of an antibody (the âparental antibodyâ) encompasses a fragment or a derivative of an antibody, typically including at least a portion of the antigen binding or variable regions (e.g. one or more CDRs) of the parental antibody, that retains at least some of the binding specificity of the parental antibody.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Examples of antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fabâ², F(abâ²)<sub>2</sub>, and Fv fragments, diabodies, linear antibodies, single-chain antibody molecules, e.g., scFv; and multi-specific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Typically, a binding fragment or derivative retains at least 10% of parental antibody's binding activity when that activity is expressed on a molar basis. Preferably, a binding fragment or derivative retains at least 20%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 100% or more of the antigen binding affinity as the parental antibody. It is also intended that a binding fragment can include conservative amino acid substitutions (referred to as âconservative variantsâ of the antibody) that do not substantially alter its biologic activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The term âbinding compoundâ refers to both antibodies and antibody fragments thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">A âFab fragmentâ is composed of one light chain and the C<sub>H</sub>1 and variable regions of one heavy chain.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">An âFcâ region contains two heavy chain fragments comprising the C<sub>H</sub>1 and C<sub>H</sub>2 domains of an antibody. The two heavy chain fragments are held together by two or more disulfide bonds and by hydrophobic interactions of the C<sub>H</sub>3 domains.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">A âFabâ² fragmentâ contains one light chain and a portion of one heavy chain that contains the V<sub>H </sub>domain and the C<sub>H</sub>1 domain and also the region between the C<sub>H</sub>1 and C<sub>H</sub>2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between the two heavy chains of two Fabâ² fragments to form a F(abâ²)<sub>2 </sub>molecule.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">A âF(abâ²)<sub>2 </sub>fragmentâ contains two light chains and two heavy chains containing a portion of the constant region between the C<sub>H</sub>1 and C<sub>H</sub>2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond is formed between the two heavy chains. A F(abâ²)<sub>2 </sub>fragment thus is composed of two Fabâ² fragments that are held together by a disulfide bond between the two heavy chains.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The âFv regionâ contains the variable regions from both the heavy and light chains, but lacks the constant regions.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The term âsingle-chain Fvâ or âscFvâ antibody refers to antibody fragments containing the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains of an antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the Fv polypeptide further contains a polypeptide linker between the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains, which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv, see Pluckthun (1994) THE PHARMACOLOGY OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The term âmonoclonal antibodyâ, as used herein, refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies constituting the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">As used herein, the term âdiabodiesâ refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments contain a heavy chain variable domain (V<sub>H</sub>) connected to a light chain variable domain (V<sub>L</sub>) in the same polypeptide chain (V<sub>H</sub>âV<sub>L </sub>or V<sub>L</sub>âV<sub>H</sub>). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, e.g., Holliger et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448.

In general, the humanized antibody will contain substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and all or substantially all of the framework (FR) regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody may optionally comprise at least a portion of a human immunoglobulin constant region (Fc).</p>

Examples include fusion proteins.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">As used herein, an antigenic polypeptide, an immunogenic polypeptide, or an immunogenic portion of a polypeptide is a polypeptide which, when introduced into a human, reacts with the human's immune system molecules, i.e., is antigenic, and/or induces an immune response in the human, i.e., is immunogenic. It is quite likely that an immunogenic polypeptide will also be antigenic, but an antigenic polypeptide, because of its size or conformation, may not necessarily be immunogenic. Examples of antigenic and immunogenic polypeptides of the present invention include, but are not limited to, <i>Mycoplasma genitalium </i>MG281 protein or fragments or variants thereof, e.g. SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:2.</p>

An âimmunogenic epitope,â as used herein, is defined as a portion of a protein that elicits an immune response in an animal, as determined by any method known in the art. The term âantigenic epitope,â as used herein, is defined as a portion of a protein to which an antibody can immunospecifically bind its antigen as determined by any method well known in the art. Immunospecific binding excludes non-specific binding but does not necessarily exclude cross-reactivity with other antigens. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic.</p>

Certain polypeptides comprising immunogenic or antigenic epitopes are at least 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 amino acid residues in length. Antigenic as well as immunogenic epitopes may be linear, i.e., be comprised of contiguous amino acids in a polypeptide, or may be three dimensional, i.e., where an epitope is comprised of non-contiguous amino acids which come together due to the secondary or tertiary structure of the polypeptide, thereby forming an epitope.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">As to the selection of peptides or polypeptides bearing an antigenic epitope (e.g., that contain a region of a protein molecule to which an antibody or T cell receptor can bind), it is well known in that art that relatively short synthetic peptides that mimic part of a protein sequence are routinely capable of eliciting an antiserum that reacts with the partially mimicked protein.

      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Peptides capable of eliciting protein-reactive sera are frequently represented in the primary sequence of a protein, can be characterized by a set of simple chemical rules, and are confined neither to immunodominant regions of intact proteins (i.e., immunogenic epitopes) nor to the amino or carboxyl terminals. Peptides that are extremely hydrophobic and those of six or fewer residues generally are ineffective at inducing antibodies that bind to the mimicked protein; longer peptides, especially those containing proline residues, usually are effective.</p>

In some embodiments, the biological sample is selected from the group consisting of plasma, serum, blood, lymph, bone marrow, and urine. In particular embodiments, the biological sample is plasma, serum or blood. In some embodiments when assaying for immunoglobulins or paraproteins during or following treatment of MGUS or multiple myeloma patients, bone marrow is the biological sample.</p>

      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">As used herein, the term âamelioratingâ or âtreatingâ means that the clinical signs and/or the symptoms associated with a particular disease or disorder are lessened as a result of the actions performed. The signs or symptoms to be monitored will be characteristic of a particular disease or disorder and will be well known to the skilled clinician, as will the methods for monitoring the signs and conditions. Thus, a âtreatment regimenâ refers to any systematic plan or course for treating a disease or disorder in a subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The term âpharmaceutically acceptable,â when used in reference to a excipient, is meant that the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.</p>

A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can contain physiologically acceptable compounds that act, for example, to stabilize or to increase the absorption of the therapeutic agent. Such physiologically acceptable compounds include, for example, carbohydrates, such as glucose, sucrose or dextrans, antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid or glutathione, chelating agents, low molecular weight proteins or other stabilizers or excipients. One skilled in the art would know that the choice of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, including a physiologically acceptable compound, depends, for example, on the physico-chemical characteristics of the therapeutic agent and on the route of administration of the composition, which can be, for example, orally, intranasally or any other such method known in the art. The pharmaceutical composition also can contain a second (or more) compound(s) such as a nutritional substance, toxin, a cytotoxic agent or another therapeutic agent, for example, a cancer chemotherapeutic agent or antibiotic.</p>

      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">Also provided herein are vaccines against <i>Mycoplasma </i>MG281 protein. A âvaccineâ is a compound or composition that elicits an immunological response in an animal to which the vaccine has been administered. An immunological response to a vaccine is the development in the host of a cellular and/or antibody-mediated immune response to the polypeptide or vaccine of interest. Usually, such a response consists of the subject producing antibodies, B cell, helper T cells, suppressor T cells, and/or cytotoxic T cells directed specifically to an antigen or antigens included in the composition or vaccine of interest.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">In particular embodiments, the vaccine contains an immunogenic amount of isolated and purified <i>Mycoplasma </i>protein in combination with a physiologically-acceptable, non-toxic vehicle. In particular embodiments the <i>Mycoplasma </i>protein is the MG281 protein (SEQ ID NO:1 or amino acid residues 17-537 of SEQ ID NO:2 or immunogenic portions thereof). In some embodiments, the vaccine may include a nucleic acid encoding SEQ ID NO:1 or amino acid residues 17-537 of SEQ ID NO:2 or immunogenic portions thereof, and in particular a plasmid containing such a nucleic acid. Vaccines of the present invention can also include effective amounts of immunological adjuvants, known to enhance an immune response.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">Further provided are methods of raising an immune response against human <i>Mycoplasma </i>comprising administering the disclosed vaccines in an immunogenic amount. The vaccines of the invention are intended for parenteral, topical, oral, or local administration. Preferably, they are administered parenterally, e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously, intradermally, or intramuscularly. Other modes of administration, however, are also acceptable. For example, the vaccine may be administered via a mucosal route, such as a nasal site. Vaccine formulations typically contain an effective amount of the active ingredient in a vehicle. The effective amount is sufficient to prevent, ameliorate or reduce the incidence of <i>Mycoplasma </i>infection in the subject. The effective amount is readily determined by one skilled in the art. The active ingredient may typically range from about 1% to about 95% (w/w) of the composition, or even higher or lower if appropriate. The quantity to be administered depends upon factors such as the age, weight and physical condition of the animal considered for vaccination. The quantity also depends upon the capacity of the subject's immune system to synthesize antibodies, and the degree of protection desired. Effective dosages can be readily established by one of ordinary skill in the art through routine trials establishing dose response curves. The subject is immunized by administration of the vaccine in one or more doses. Multiple doses may be administered as is required to maintain a state of immunity to <i>Mycoplasma. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">To prepare a vaccine, the immunogenic <i>Mycoplasma </i>protein or proteins can be isolated, lyophilized and stabilized.

Suitable adjuvants include but are not limited to surfactants, e.g., hexadecylamine, octadecylamine, lysolecithin, dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide, N,N-dioctadecyl-Nâ²-N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl-propane di-amine), methoxyhexadecyl-glycerol, and pluronic polyols; polanions, e.g., pyran, dextran sulfate, poly IC, polyacrylic acid, carbopol; peptides, e.g., muramyl dipeptide, MPL, aimethylglycine, tuftsin, oil emulsions, alum, and mixtures thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">The terms ânucleic acid,â ânucleic acid molecule,â or ânucleic acid fragmentâ refers to any one or more nucleic acid segments, e.g., DNA or RNA fragments, present in a polynucleotide or construct. While the term ânucleic acid,â as used herein, is meant to include any nucleic acid, the term ânucleic acid fragmentâ is used herein to refer to a fragment of nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide, or fragment, variant, or derivative thereof. As used herein, a âcoding regionâ is a portion of nucleic acid which consists of codons translated into amino acids. Although a âstop codonâ (TAG, TGA, or TAA) is not translated into an amino acid, it may be considered to be part of a coding region, but any flanking sequences, for example promoters, ribosome binding sites, transcriptional terminators, and the like, are not part of a coding region. Two or more nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments of the present invention can be present in a single polynucleotide construct, e.g., on a single plasmid, or in separate polynucleotide constructs, e.g., on separate plasmids. Furthermore, any nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment may encode a single polypeptide, e.g., a single antigen, an antibody or antibody fragment, a cytokine, or regulatory polypeptide, or may encode more than one polypeptide, e.g., a nucleic acid may encode two or more polypeptides. In addition, a nucleic acid may encode a regulatory element such as a promoter or a transcription terminator, or may encode heterologous coding regions, e.g. specialized elements or motifs, such as a secretory signal peptide or a functional domain.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the studies provided herein suggest that a sustained interaction with the innate or acquired microbiome plays a role in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies, an important factor being the approximation of two systems each capable of sustained replication such that one drives the other. Thus, the replicating microbe induces proliferation and selection of the replicating B-cell repertoire. These concepts are testable in human tumors of lymphoid origin in which there is a malignant transformation of a single member of the B-cell repertoire leading to a clonal proliferation of immune cells. Thus, because they produce antibodies, tumors of lymphoid origin are malignancies that express a potential marker that can selectively identify agents to which they were exposed. In multiple myeloma this clonal expansion involves plasma cells that are advantageous for study because they produce very large quantities of their signature immunoglobulin molecule.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">There are several theories concerning the origin of multiple myeloma. One suggestion is that there is a stochastic transformation event that is no different than other oncogenic events except that it affects a single member of a diversity system. In this model the unique immunoglobulins produced by each tumor are not involved in the pathogenesis of the malignancy, and simply reflect the phenotype of the single member of the diversity system that was transformed. Alternatively, as with the B-cell infiltrates in the transplanted kidneys, the tumors may arise after sustained exposure to an inescapable antigen drive that may originate from an endogenous or exogenous immunogen. These models make very different predictions about the nature of the immunoglobulins produced by the multiple myeloma plasma cell tumors. In the stochastic model the immunoglobulins are irrelevant and simply reflect the phenotype of the individual member of the diversity system that was transformed. In the model that postulates antigenic drive, the antibody produced by the initiating immunogen must react with the antibody produced by the tumor. If there is a common initiating event, then immunoglobulins produced by different tumors should react with a single antigen or should at least, in the case of microbes, react with antigens of a single species. Finally, if a pathogen solely drives the innate immune system, the oncogenic outcome will look like a stochastic process but there will be orthogonal evidence for the presence of a common pathogen.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">At one level, the results of the experiments provided herein can be considered to fall in the realm of classical serology wherein one associates an antibody response to a pathogen with a particular disease. Other experiments are then necessary to establish pathogenesis as occurred, for example in AIDS and Lyme disease. However, the results provided herein in multiple myeloma are very different in that the unique antibody molecules produced by each clone are a signature of an intimate interaction between a pathogen and a cell that ultimately becomes malignant. In a sense this is cellular serology as opposed to serum serology. When one works with B-cells which are members of a very large diversity system the evidence for association between a pathogen and disease becomes more compelling when many members of the repertoire upon transformation make antibodies to the same pathogen. Furthermore, the fact that <i>Mycoplasma </i>membrane proteins are highly mitogenic for B-cells may offer an explanation for the initial clonal expansion in that simultaneous engagement of the B-Cell receptor and a toll ligand can lead to co-stimulation of the cells resulting in a selectable replicative advantage.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">The natural history of multiple myeloma both gives clues as to how a sustained interaction with a pathogen may induce the disease and suggests a way forward to prove the pathogenesis. About 3% of the world's population has a monoclonal gamopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which is a benign but obligatory precursor to multiple myeloma where the immunoglobulin produced by the cells responsible for the MGUS syndrome is identical to that of the myeloma cells. MGUS has a myeloma progression risk of about 1% per year. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, given the studies provided herein, one mechanism is that MGUS results from sustained interaction with a highly immunogenic strain of <i>Mycoplasma </i>where the inescapable antigenic drive and concomitant cellular proliferation ultimately leads to a malignant transformation and frank myeloma. Thus, the elimination of <i>Mycoplasma </i>infection at the first sign of MGUS should reduce the rate of progression and frank myeloma would decline.</p>

      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">The present study demonstrated that a majority of monoclonal immunoglobulins (Ig) from the sera of 80 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or frank multiple myeloma (MM), showed highly selective reactivity with an antigen from human <i>Mycoplasma genitalium </i>and <i>Mycoplasma penetrans</i>, but not from a set of other human or animal mycoplasmas. It was further shown that that human plasma cell lines from a subset of MM patients secreting intact Ig 10/14 exhibited similar reactivity to this <i>mycoplasma </i>antigen. To show that reactivity was associated with the monoclonal paraprotein, the immunoglobulin Fab fragment from one MM patient was crystallized and the structure was determined to a 1.2 â« resolution. The dissolved crystals of the Fab fragments of the immunoglobulin molecules retained reactivity to the <i>mycoplasma </i>antigen, thereby confirming the direct connection to the monoclonal paraprotein. These studies suggest that sustained exposure to <i>mycoplasma </i>antigens may play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma. <figref>FIG. 3</figref> provides the amino acid sequences of the light chain and heavy chain from the crystal structure of the Fab fragment of the immunoglobulin purified from multiple myeloma patient plasma sample 13PL. Also shown are the CDR sequences present in each chain.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">In one experiment, plasma samples from four different multiple myeloma patients were tested for reactivity against cell extracts from several <i>mycoplasma </i>species. Briefly, Western blot analysis was performed on cell extracts from nine <i>Mycoplasma </i>strains that included four human pathogens (i.e., <i>M. fermentans, M pneumoniae, M genitalium</i>, and <i>M. penetrans</i>), one alligator (i.e., <i>M. alligatoris</i>), one crocodile (i.e., <i>M. crocodyli</i>), one rat (i.e., <i>M. pulmonis</i>), one bovine (i.e., <i>M. mycoides</i>), and one plant pathogen (i.e., <i>A. laidlawii</i>). <i>Mycoplasma </i>cells were grown, and after centrifugation the cells were inactivated with antibiotics, and lysed using lysis buffer from Sigma Aldrich. Nucleic acids were removed by treatment with DNAase and RNAase. The extracts were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. Plasma samples from four different multiple myeloma patients were tested as the primary antibody source against the antigen panel (i.e., the <i>mycoplasma </i>cell extracts). The secondary antibody used was anti-human IgG-HRP (horseradish peroxidase) conjugate. In the resulting Western blot, strong bands were observed around 40 kD in lanes containing <i>M. genitalium </i>and <i>M. penetrans</i>, which indicated that these Multiple Myeloma patients had antibodies against <i>M. genitalium </i>and <i>M. penetrans. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">In another experiment, plasma samples from two different multiple myeloma patients and a chronic kidney transplant rejection patient were tested for reactivity against cell extracts from several <i>mycoplasma </i>species. <i>Mycoplasma </i>cells were grown, treated, separated on SDS-page gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for western blot analysis as described above. Plasma samples from two multiple myeloma patients, one chronic kidney transplant rejection patient, and fourth panel with no primary antibody were tested as the primary antibody source against the antigen panel (i.e., the <i>mycoplasma </i>cell extracts). The secondary antibody used was antihuman IgG HRP conjugate. In this experiment, one of the multiple myeloma plasma samples (labeled â4PLâ) showed strong bands around 40 kD in lanes containing <i>M. genitalium </i>and <i>M. penetrans</i>, whereas the other of the multiple myeloma plasma samples (labeled â3PLâ) and plasma sample from the chronic kidney transplant rejection patient (labeled âCANâ) showed relatively low intensity. The secondary antibody control (i.e., the sample with no primary antibody) showed that there is no reactivity of the secondary antibody with the antigens.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">In another experiment, plasma samples from two normal blood donor controls were tested for reactivity against cell extracts from several <i>mycoplasma </i>species. <i>Mycoplasma </i>cells were grown, treated, separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for western blot analysis as described above. Plasma samples from two donor controls plasma were tested as primary antibody source against the antigen panel (i.e., the <i>mycoplasma </i>cell extracts). The secondary antibody used was antihuman IgG HRP conjugate. Both controls showed relatively low intensity bands around 40 kD in lanes containing <i>M. genitalium </i>and <i>M. penetrans</i>, indicating this reactivity and affinity is present in normal controls as well but at a lower level.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">The next experiment was conducted to establish that in the case of multiple myeloma patients, the reactivity was coming from the spike (i.e., gel electrophoresis of serum protein from an MM patient identifies an M protein (excess monoclonal antibody or paraprotein) as a narrow peak or âspikeâ in the Î³, Î² or Î±2 regions of the densitometer tracing of the gel). IgG was purified and digested into Fab fragment, which was then crystallized, the crystal being the most purified form of that molecule. Crystals were washed and re-dissolved to be used as primary antibody in Western blotting. The resulting Western blot showed the same reactivity for the purified Fab fragment against the antigen panel (i.e., the <i>mycoplasma </i>cell extracts) as observed with the plasma of Multiple Myeloma patients plasma, which confirmed that the binding was coming from the spike.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">In another experiment, plasma IgG (G20) and IgA (A8) samples from two MGUS patients were tested for reactivity against cell extracts from several <i>mycoplasma </i>species. <i>Mycoplasma </i>cells were grown, treated, separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for western blot analysis as described above. Plasma samples from two donor controls plasma were tested as primary antibody source against the antigen panel (i.e., the <i>mycoplasma </i>cell extracts). The secondary antibody used was antihuman IgG HRP conjugate and antihuman IgA HRP conjugate. Both samples showed similar bands around 40 kD in lanes containing <i>M. genitalium </i>and <i>M. penetrans </i>as compared to multiple myeloma.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">In another experiment, plasma samples from three different multiple myeloma patients were tested for reactivity against cell extracts from thirteen <i>Mycoplasma genitalium </i>mutants (i.e., <i>M. genitalium </i>mutants 039, 051, 147, 213, 238, 255, 285, 288, 289, 294, 316, 343, and 438) along with wild type <i>Mycoplasma genitalium </i>(Lane 1 â<i>M. genitalium </i>G37â). <i>Mycoplasma </i>cells were grown, treated, separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for western blot analysis as described above. Three multiple myeloma patients' plasma and fourth panel with no primary were tested as the primary antibody source against the antigen panel. The secondary antibody used was antihuman IgG HRP conjugate. The results indicated binding of antigen in 6 of the mutants (i.e., <i>M. genitalium </i>mutants 147, 238, 255, 316, 343, and 438), and the wild type and that binding disappeared in seven un-related mutants (i.e., <i>M. genitalium </i>mutants 039, 051, 213, 285, 288, 289, and 294). No binding was observed in the control blot that lacked a primary antibody.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">In another experiment, three cell-lines derived from B-cell lymphocyte plasma cells from multiple myeloma producing only light chain antibody (âLCâ) or full IgG (âCBR-09â and âCMMâ) were tested for reactivity against cell extracts from <i>M. genitalium, M penetrans</i>, K12 <i>E. coli </i>and Wil2. <i>Mycoplasma</i>, K12, and Wil2 cells were grown, treated, separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for western blot analysis as described above. Supernatants from the B-cell lymphocyte plasma cells derived from multiple myeloma producing only light chain antibody (LC), full IgG (CBR-09 and CMM) were tested as primary antibody source against the antigen panel along with the multiple myeloma patient plasma. The secondary antibody used was antihuman IgG HRP conjugate. Strong bands were observed around 40 kD in lanes containing <i>M. genitalium </i>and <i>M. penetrans</i>, but not in lanes containing K12 <i>E. coli </i>or Wil2 extracts, when the source of the primary antibody was from the supernatants of cells secreting full IgG (âCBR-09â and âCMMâ), confirming that Multiple Myeloma clonal antibodies react with antigens present in <i>M. genitalium </i>and <i>M. penetrans. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">Identification of the antigen in <i>M. genitalium </i>cell extracts. An affinity column was made with the purified IgG from multiple myeloma patient plasma (â4PLâ). <i>Mycoplasma genitalium </i>cells were grown and after centrifugation the cells were inactivated with antibiotics lysed using lysis buffer from Sigma Aldrich. Nucleic acids were removed by treatment with DNAase and RNAase. The reactive molecule was affinity purified from this cell extract using the affinity column containing the purified IgG from 4PL. Western blot analysis (using the 4PL plasma as the source of the primary antibody and antihuman IgG HRP conjugate as the secondary antibody) confirmed the presence of the antigen at about 40 kD in the first elution step (Elution 1). This band was observed in the <i>M. genitalium </i>standard lane, but was not observed in the control blot in which no primary antibody was used. Thus, the antigen molecule was isolated from cell extract. A silver stained gel showed the presence of the antigen in the first elution step. The antigen was then excised from the gel for proteomic analysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">Proteomics analysis of the excised band revealed the reactive molecule in <i>Mycoplasma genitalium </i>extract is uncharacterized protein MG281 (GenBank Accession No. P47523).</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">Western blot analysis was conducted on cell extracts of <i>M. genitalium, M. penetrans</i>, and Wil2 and an <i>M. genitalium </i>mutant that does not make MG281 (âMG281 null mutantâ). Cells were grown and after centrifugation the cells were inactivated with antibiotics, cells were lysed using lysis buffer from Sigma Aldrich. Nucleic acids were removed by treatment with DNAase and RNAase. The extracts were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. Three different multiple myeloma patients' plasma were tested as primary antibody source against the antigen panel. A fourth blot was used as a control for the secondary antibody, in which no primary antibody was used. The secondary antibody used was antihuman IgG HRP conjugate. The strong band around 40 kD was present in the lanes containing extracts from <i>M. genitalium </i>and <i>M. penetrans</i>, but was not present in the lane containing the extract from the MG281 null mutant, confirming MG281 as the antigen.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">In another experiment, a recombinant MG281 (59 kD) was expressed in <i>E. coli </i>and was tested for binding with multiple myeloma antibodies. Purified recombinant MG281, as well as crude MG281 in <i>E. coli </i>cell lysate, Wil2 cell extract, <i>M. genitalium </i>cell extract, and <i>M. penetrans </i>cell extract were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. Two different multiple myeloma patients' plasma (â4PLâ and â13PLâ) along with purified IgG from a multiple myeloma patient were tested as primary antibody sources against the antigen panel of the recombinant MG281, cell lysate and cell extracts above. The secondary antibody used was antihuman IgG HRP conjugate. The strong band around 59 kD in the lanes containing purified recombinant MG281, as well as the lanes containing the crude MG281 in <i>E. coli </i>cell lysate, confirmed MG281 as the antigen for multiple myeloma paraproteins.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">In another experiment, plasma from a normal healthy mother and matched cord plasma were tested as primary antibody sources against cell extracts from <i>M. genitalium </i>and <i>M. penetrans</i>, as well as Wil2 and K12 <i>E. coli </i>extracts. Cells were grown, treated, separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis as described above. Normal healthy mother and matched cord plasma were used as the source of primary antibody and the secondary antibody used was antihuman IgG HRP conjugate. The resulting blot showed that cord plasma did not contain the antibody against <i>Mycoplasma</i>, whereas the mother's plasma did contain the antibody against <i>Mycoplasma. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">This experiment was done to identify stable MG281 protein fragment. His6 tagged recombinant MG281 (59 kD) was expressed in <i>E. coli </i>and was subjected to Trypsin digest in solution for several time intervals. The reaction included 16.9 nmoles (1 eq) MG281 and 8.5 nmoles (0.5 eq) trypsin and was incubated at 37Â° C. The reaction product was separated on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. Multiple myeloma patient plasma or anti-His antibody was used as the primary antibody source. The secondary antibody used was antihuman IgG HRP conjugate. The fragmented MG281 was tested by Western blot for the presence of C-terminal His6 tag (AntiHis Western blot). It appeared that an Ë40 kD fragment of recombinant MG281 had a stable 3D structure. The rest was digested. After 5 hours the 40 kD band also started disappearing.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">This experiment was conducted to determine if multiple myeloma antibodies protect the recombinant MG281 from digestion. His6 tagged recombinant MG281 (59 kD) was expressed in <i>E. coli </i>and was incubated with two different multiple myeloma antibodies 4PL and 13PL for 30 minutes. After incubation, trypsin was added and aliquots were taken at different time points. The reaction product was separated on SDS gel under non-reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for western blot analysis. Multiple myeloma patient plasma (7PL) was used as primary antibody source. The secondary antibody used was antihuman IgG HRP conjugate. The fragmented MG281 was tested by western blot for the presence of C-terminal His6 tag (AntiHis western blot). It appeared that the Ë40 kD fragment of MG281 that was shown to have a stable 3D structure in the previous experiment, is protected by multiple myeloma antibodies from digestion by trypsin. Even after 5 hours the 40 kD band is unchanged suggesting strong solution state antigen-antibody binding.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">In another experiment, the MG281 protein was analyzed in silico using PONDR software and neural network training data VL3, VL-XT, and XL1-XT; and the results identify the various predicted disordered amino acid residue regions in the protein. (The first letter of the PONDR predictor network refers to the method of characterization with X representing x-ray and V representing various. The second letter refers to the length or location of the disordered region with L representing long stretches (40 or more residues), and T representing residues at either terminus (5 or more residues). Therefore VL-XT refers to the merger of three predictors, one trained on variously characterized long disordered regions and two trained on x-ray characterized terminal disordered regions.) PONDR functions from primary sequence data alone. The predictors are feedforward neural networks that use sequence information from windows of generally 21 amino acids. Attributes, such as the fractional composition of particular amino acids or hydropathy, are calculated over this window, and these values are used as inputs for the predictor. The neural network, which has been trained on a specific set of ordered and disordered sequences, then outputs a value for the central amino acid in the window. The predictions are then smoothed over a sliding window of typically nine amino acids. If a residue value exceeds a threshold of 0.5 (PONDR score), the residue is considered disordered. The results are shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>.</p>

      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">MG281 is Mitogenic</heading>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">The binding specificity showed that MG281 (Protein M) has the properties of a class or non-specific immunoglobulin binding proteins, sometimes referred to as B-cell super antigens. B-cell superantigens can cause either apoptosis or proliferation of lymphocytes. To determine whether Protein-M was functional, we tested its ability to stimulate B-cells. We tested full-length rProtein-M (rProtein-M FL), a purified 40 kD fragment obtained after trypsin digestion of rProtein-M (rProtein-M TD) and endotoxin free full length rProtein-M (EF rProtein-M FL) in a luminescence based BrDU proliferation ELISA assay. The mitogenicpotential of Protein-M and it's derivatives was compared to a cross-linked mouse anti-human IgG/anti-mouse IgG pair (IgG-IgG) and <i>E. coli </i>LPS. Addition of rProtein-M to CD19+ human B-cells induced cellular proliferation, suggesting that Protein-M is able to engage the B-cell receptor (BCR) and initiate a downstream cascade leading to cell proliferation. The truncated version of rProtein-M TD was not functional. As expected from the studies of others, no proliferation was seen in LPS treated human CD19+ B-cells and the degree of proliferation for rProtein-M FL and EF rProtein-M FL were similar. To determine whether Protein-M, when present on the <i>mycoplasma </i>cell surface was mitogenic, irradiated wild type G37 <i>mycoplasma genitalium </i>cells that expressed Protein-M and a Protein-M null mutant were tested for their ability to induce proliferation of human CD19+ B-cells. It was found that wild type G37 <i>Mycoplasma genitalium </i>stimulated the B-cells whereas the MG 281 null mutant did not, suggesting that Protein-M is mitogenic when present in the intact organism.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">Ability of MG281 to bind to various antibodies was examined. MG281 constructs were made each with an N-terminal 6-His tag, followed by a thrombin cleavage site, and a fragment of MG281. The MG281-Trypsin digest (MG281-T) construct contained residues 74 to 468 (SEQ ID NO:11); MG281F1 construct contained residues 134 to 269 (SEQ ID NO:12); and MG281F2 construct contained residues 278 to 450 (SEQ ID NO:13). These sequences are shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">In this experiment, the various MG281 fragment constructs were expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, then purified, and tested for binding with multiple myeloma antibodies. Purified recombinant MG281F2 (at two concentrations: 1 Î¼g/Î¼g and 2 Î¼g/Î¼g), MG281-T and MG281 were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. Multiple myeloma patient plasma 13PL was tested as the primary antibody source against the antigen panel of the purified MG281 and fragments. The secondary antibody used was antihuman IgG HRP conjugate. A second blot was used as a control for the secondary antibody, in which no primary antibody was used. A third blot utilized Ponceau Red only. The strong band around 59 kD in the lanes containing purified recombinant MG281, and the strong band around 50 kD in the lanes containing purified recombinant MG281-T, confirmed MG281 and MG281-T as antigens for the multiple myeloma paraproteins or antibodies. MG281F1 alone and MG281F2 alone were not sufficient for antibody binding. Therefore, both F1 and F2 are required for antibody binding.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">In another experiment, the MG281 protein was profiled via Western blot and shown to bind to both kappa and lambda light chains, wherein the primary antibody was either human IgG2 kappa light chain, or human IgG2 lampda light chain, or human IgG3; and the secondary antibody was anti-human.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">The affinity (Kd) of immunoglobulins for MG281 was determined utilizing a) MG281-T-His with the Fab from plasma 13PL resulting in a Kd of 4.2 nM; b) MG281-T-His with IgG from plasma 13PL resulting in a Kd of 0.17 nM; c) MG281-T-His with the Fab from plasma 4PL resulting in a Kd of 5.2 nM; and d) MG281-T-His with IgG from plasma 4PL resulting in a Kd of 0.23 nM.</p>

      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="1">MG281 Inhibits Antibody-Antigen Union</heading>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">The structural studies suggested that protein-M should preclude the ability of the antibody to bind to its antigen because it distorts the CDRs and may use its c-terminal domain to cover the entrance to the antibody-combining site. We tested the ability of protein-M to block antigen-antibody union for six different antigen-antibody pairs, two of which were polyclonal. As detailed below, prior incubation of the antibody with protein-M completely inhibited binding to its cognate antigen. The order of addition is critical. However, once antigen-antibody union has occurred, protein-M is unable to disrupt the complex in most cases. This may occur because of steric effects or a change in the conformation of the CDR's in the presence of antigen. Whereas in case of small hepatitis C glycoprotein antigen-antibody complex, a full tertiary complex was observed. Furthermore, to test the importance of the canonical relationship of the CDR's to protein-M binding, a domain swapped antibody was studied. Protein-M did not bind to the domain swapped antibody, indicating that the relationship between the heavy and light chains is critical for binding.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0110">In one experiment, full length recombinant MG281 and MG281-T were shown to inhibit the antibody antigen union between HIV mAb PGT 135 with is cognate antigen GP120 in an ELISA assay. GP120 was coated on the plate at 100 ng/well. Antibody complex with MG281 and antibody at 2 Î¼g/ml was serially diluted. Goat antihuman HRP was used as the secondary antibody. The results are shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> and indicate that MG281 or MG281-T, when bound to the antibody, causes it to lose its ability to bind with its cognate antigen.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0111">Other antibody antigen union experiments were run utilizing different pairs of antibodies and antigens. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b>, full length recombinant MG281 or MG281-T, when bound to the antibody, causes it to lose its ability to bind with its cognate antigen.
