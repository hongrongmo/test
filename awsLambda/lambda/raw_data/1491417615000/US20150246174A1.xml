      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Considerable advances have been made in the field of therapeutic agent (e.g. drug) delivery technology over the last three decades, resulting in many breakthroughs in clinical medicine. The creation of therapeutic agent delivery devices that are capable of delivering therapeutic agents in controlled ways is still a challenge. One of the major requirements for an implantable drug delivery device is controlled release of therapeutic agents, ranging from small drug molecules to larger biological molecules. It is particularly desirable to achieve a continuous passive drug release profile consistent with zero order kinetics whereby the concentration of drug in the bloodstream remains constant throughout an extended delivery period.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">These devices have the potential to improve therapeutic efficacy, diminish potentially life-threatening side effects, improve patient compliance, minimize the intervention of healthcare personnel, reduce the duration of hospital stays, and decrease the diversion of regulated drugs to abusive uses.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Nanochannel delivery devices may be used in drug delivery products for the effective administration of drugs. In addition, nanochannel delivery devices can be used in other applications where controlled release of a substance over time is needed.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Embodiments of this invention comprise a nanochannel delivery device having nanochannels within a structure configured to yield high mechanical strength and high flow rates. Various fabrication protocols may be used to form the nanochannel delivery device. Embodiments of the fabricated devices feature horizontal nanochannel lay-out (e.g., the nanochannel is parallel to the primary plane of the device), high molecule transport rate, high mechanical strength, optional multilayered lay-out, amenability to select channel lining materials, and possible transparent top cover. Based on silicon microfabrication technology, the dimensions of the nanochannel area as well as concomitant microchannel areas can be precisely controlled, thus providing a predictable, reliable, constant release rate of drug (or other) molecules over an extended time period. In certain embodiments, the nanochannel delivery device can be used to build a multilayered nanochannel structure. Multilayered nanochannel structures can extend the limit of release rate range of a single layer nanochannel delivery device or system, and allow a wide range of pre-defined porosity to achieve an arbitrary release rate using any preferred nanochannel size.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In certain embodiments, the nanochannel delivery device is made of a âsandwichâ of materials, composed of a thin top layer, the horizontal nanochannels, and a thicker bottom wafer. The thin top layer can house an array of microchannels that offer an inlet or outlet for diffusing molecules. It can also serve as the lid or ceiling for the nanochannels by providing the channels' top surface. The thicker bottom wafer can house an array of microchannels that offer a collateral outlet or inlet. Note that in the following, inlets are indicated in the bottom wafer and outlets are indicated in the top layer, but this is not a limit of the invention. In certain embodiments, the nanochannels are fabricated by a sacrificial layer technique that provides smooth surfaces and precisely controlled dimensions. The nanochannels can be formed in between the two layers and connect the outlet microchannels with the array of inlet microchannels formed in the bottom wafer, additionally allowing thin surface layers to be applied to both the top and the bottom surfaces independently, in order to optimize channel properties such as surface charge, hydrophobicity, wetting and conductivity. Each inlet and outlet microchannel can be connected to one, two, or more nanochannels. The height, width, and length of the nanochannel can be used to maintain a constant (zero-order) delivery. By the help of nanofabrication, a nanochannel length of 10 nm or less is feasible.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In certain embodiments, the nanochannel delivery device is designed to yield high strength. This can be achieved by a supporting structure obtained in the bottom side of the thick wafer. The structure can be composed by a regular mesh of micrometric walls which create the side surfaces of larger inlet macrochannels. Moreover, the top portion of the bottom wafer (in or on which nanochannels may be fabricated) can be engineered to provide good mechanical stability.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The thickness of the supporting layer underneath the nanochannels can be optimized, and can be realized by controlling the depth of the inlet microchannels and outlet macrochannels or by selecting an SOI wafer with appropriate depth of buried oxide layer. The materials and thickness of top layers is also optimized for the attributes noted above.</p>

      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">
        <figref>FIGS. 1</figref>
        <i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>j</i>, <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>E, and <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>G provide illustrations of steps performed in an exemplary first method of manufacturing a nanochannel delivery device. Specific dimensions are provided for purposes of illustration only, and it is understood that other exemplary embodiments may comprise different dimensions.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">In one exemplary embodiment manufactured according to this protocol, the top layer is a cover of a 5 Î¼m thick evaporated glass layer and the bottom wafer is a 4 inch SOI wafer with a 30 Î¼m device layer, and a 500 Î¼m bulk layer, so that the supporting layer under the nanochannels has 30 Î¼m thickness. In this exemplary structure, the inlet and outlet microchannels are 5 Î¼m by 5 Î¼m, and the in-plane dimension of each nanochannel is 5 Î¼m by 5 Î¼m. The space between adjacent openings (e.g., the distance between adjacent nanochannels) is 2 Î¼m. The inlet macrochannel under the support network is approximately 200 Î¼m by 200 Î¼m up through the 500 Î¼m thick bulk layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">A general overview of this method of manufacturing will first be presented, followed by a more detailed discussion of the features comprised in the nanochannel delivery device. In this embodiment, fabrication of the nanochannel delivery device does not utilize chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), and the microfabrication protocol comprises the following steps. Starting with a SOI (silicon on insulator) wafer (see <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>), a hard mask layer such as silicon nitride film or LTO (low temperature oxidation) film that will protect underneath silicon during thermal oxidation process is deposited. If silicon nitride is used, a silicon dioxide pad layer may be deposited before nitride deposition. As an alternative, the bottom substrate can also be a silicon wafer instead of SOI if the etching process rates are well characterized. In this case, the etching depth is controlled by timing.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">The nanochannel areas can then be patterned on the mask layer using photolithography process. (see <figref>FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>2</b>B), and the mask materials on nanochannel areas are selectively removed but do not affect underneath silicon. A combination of dry etching, and short time wet etching may be applied for this purpose. Then a silicon dioxide film (with a thickness that is well-controlled) can be deposited on bare silicon area by thermal oxidation. In this embodiment, the thickness of the oxidation layer is used to define the height of nanochannels, and the mask layer is stripped.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">A mask layer suitable for deep silicon etching can then be deposited. The mask layer should be able to be patterned, and have a high selectivity to silicon during deep silicon etching process. Depending on the technique for deep silicon etching, a layer of silicon oxide, photoresist, or metal film may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">In this embodiment, the inlet microchannels are patterned on the mask layer, and the inlet microchannels are etched down to the oxide layer of the SOI wafer by deep RIE (Reactive Ion Etch) or ICP (Inductive Coupled Plasma) technique, as shown <figref>FIGS. 1</figref> (<i>b</i>) and <b>2</b>C. If a silicon wafer is used, the etching depth is determined by etching rate and time.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">The inlet macrochannels (the large openings from the back) are laid out and etched to the oxide layer of SOI wafer, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1(</figref><i>c</i>) and <b>2</b>D, and the exposed oxide areas are cleaned by HF solution. (see <figref>FIGS. 1(</figref><i>d</i>) and <b>2</b>E). To fabricate the top cover of the nanochannel delivery devices in this embodiment, starting with a support wafer (e.g., a silicon wafer), a sacrificial layer is deposited. (see <figref>FIGS. 1(</figref><i>e</i>), <b>1</b>(<i>f</i>) and <b>3</b>A). This sacrificial layer (e.g., indium tin oxide (ITO)), is selected so that it can be removed in a solution that is safe for silicon and top cover materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">The top cover of the nanochannel delivery devices is deposited on the sacrificial layer (see <figref>FIGS. 1(</figref><i>g</i>) and <b>3</b>B), and the outlets are patterned on the structure, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1(</figref><i>h</i>) and <b>3</b>C). As an alternative, a lift-off technique may be applied for the cases of sputtered glass or e-beam evaporated glass. The materials may be any suitable material, e.g. spin-on-glass, sputtered glass, e-beam evaporated glass, ITO-glass sandwich, silicon, polymer, etc. The materials may include glass and glass materials known to those skilled in the art to bond to silicon by specific means, e.g., anodic bonding or fusion bonding. The materials should be able to bond to silicon by certain means. For instance of glass, anodic bonding can be applied. A spin-on-glass layer may also applicable. Depending on the surface quality, a planarization process may be needed.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">The structure wafer and the top cover are bonded together by a technique such as anodic bonding or SiâSi direct bonding or intermediate layer aided bonding, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1(</figref><i>c</i>), <b>3</b>D, and <b>3</b>E, and the support wafer of top cover is removed (as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1(</figref><i>j</i>) and <b>3</b>F). Finally, the individual nanochannel delivery devices are obtained by dicing the wafer, and cleaning.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">In another exemplary embodiment manufactured according to this protocol, while keeping the bottom silicon substrate is the same 4 inch SOI wafer with a 30 Î¼m device layer and a 500 Î¼m bulk layer as that mentioned in above embodiment, the top layer is a 10 Î¼m thick glass film. The 10 um thick glass film is manufactured by thinning a thicker glass layer. To make this thin film, a 100 um to 500 um thick glass wafer is bonded to the structural silicon substrate. A planarization technique such as backgrinding, or lapping, or CMP, or chemical etching, or dry etching is then applied to thin the glass layer until the designed thickness such 10 um is reached. The outlets are then patterned on the thinned glass film, and etched down to the underneath silicon surface to open the outlets. In this exemplary structure, the inlet and outlet microchannels are 5 Î¼m by 5 Î¼m, and the in-plane dimension of each nanochannel is 5 Î¼m by 5 Î¼m. The space between adjacent openings (e.g., the distance between adjacent nanochannels) is 2 Î¼m. The inlet macrochannel under the support network is 200 Î¼m by 200 Î¼m up through the 500 Î¼m thick bulk layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">Referring specifically now to <figref>FIGS. 2A-2E</figref> and <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F, a more detailed view of the features of nanochannel delivery device <b>100</b> is provided. Referring initially to <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, an SOI wafer <b>10</b> comprises a top layer <b>15</b> over a substrate <b>20</b> and separated by an oxide layer <b>35</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 2B</figref>, a series of nanochannels <b>25</b> are formed using a pattern mask in top layer <b>15</b>. One or more inlet microchannels <b>30</b> is formed using a pattern mask in each nanochannel <b>25</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 2C</figref>, exposing an oxide layer <b>35</b> between the substrate <b>20</b> and the top layer <b>15</b>. For purposes of clarity not all features, for example inlet microchannels <b>30</b>, are labeled in the figures.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2D</figref>, a portion of substrate <b>20</b> is removed using a pattern mask from below the oxide layer <b>35</b>. Oxide layer <b>35</b> is then removed (as shown in <figref>FIG. 2E</figref>), and inlet microchannels <b>30</b> are formed to allow passage of material through the substrate <b>20</b> and top layer <b>15</b>. At this stage, the lower portion <b>40</b> of nanochannel delivery device <b>100</b> is complete.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 3A-3F</figref>, the fabrication of the upper portion <b>45</b> of nanochannel delivery device <b>100</b> begins with a sacrificial layer <b>50</b> deposited on a support substrate <b>55</b>. In addition, an additional layer <b>60</b> (e.g., spin-on-glass, sputtered glass, e-beam evaporated glass, ITO-glass sandwich, silicon, polymer, etc.) may be used in processes utilizing a lift-off technique, as shown in <figref>FIG. 3B</figref>. Exit microchannels <b>70</b> are formed in sacrificial layer (and additional layer <b>60</b>, if utilized) as shown in <figref>FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">At this stage, upper portion <b>45</b> is ready to be bonded to lower portion <b>40</b> of nanochannel delivery device <b>100</b>. It is understood, the designations âupperâ and âlowerâ are used only for purposes of clarification in the description of the figures, and do not dictate the relationship of components during use of the device. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 3D and 3E</figref>, upper portion <b>45</b> and lower portion <b>40</b> are bonded together (through, e.g., anodic bonding or SiâSi direct bonding or intermediate layer aided bonding). Support substrate <b>55</b> is removed from upper portion <b>45</b>, and nanochannel delivery device <b>100</b> is completed, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 3F and 3G</figref>. The embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 3G</figref> comprises optional tapered surfaces in the transitions between outlet microchannels <b>70</b> and nanochannels <b>25</b>, as well as between nanochannels <b>25</b> and inlet microchannels <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">As shown in <figref>FIG. 3G</figref>, nanochannels <b>25</b> lie in a plane parallel to the primary plane of nanochannel delivery device <b>100</b> (e.g., the plane defined by the larger dimensions [in this example, L and W] of nanochannel delivery device <b>100</b>). Such a configuration allows for the length of nanochannel <b>25</b> (e.g., approximately the distance between adjacent outlet <b>70</b> and inlet <b>30</b>) and the height and width of the nanochannel to be varied without varying the length L, width W, and thickness T of nanochannel delivery device <b>100</b>. The thickness T of nanochannel delivery device <b>100</b> can therefore be based on other criteria (such as mechanical integrity) rather than the need to control the flow of a substance being delivered via nanochannel delivery device <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">The embodiments shown in <figref>FIGS. 3A-3G</figref> also provide for each outlet <b>70</b> to be in fluid communication with any inlet <b>30</b> via a single nanochannel <b>25</b>.

For example, the diffusion rate through nanochannel delivery device <b>100</b> is more closely related to the dimensions of nanochannel <b>25</b>, as compared to configurations that have numerous nanochannels in fluid communication with a single extended inlet. In such configurations, the inlet (rather than the nanochannel) may become a restriction on flow and limit the ability to control the flow by varying the dimensions of the nanochannel.</p>

      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0106">In a second embodiment, a multilayered nanochannel structure can be fabricated by modifying the above-described protocol 1. This embodiment comprises the following steps.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0107">Starting with a SOI (silicon on insulator) silicon wafer, a silicon dioxide layer (with a thickness that is well-controlled) is deposited by thermal oxidation. The thickness of the oxidation layer can be used to define the height of nanochannels. As an alternative, the bottom substrate can also be silicon wafer instead of SOI if the etching process rates are well characterized. The nanochannel areas can be patterned on the oxide layer using photolithography process.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0108">The silicon oxide on non-nanochannel areas can be selectively removed but not affect the oxide on nanochannel area. (See <figref>FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>)). A polysilicon structure layer can be deposited on the top of oxide nanochannel spacing layer. (see <figref>FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>)). A second defined thickness oxide layer can be deposited again, and the nanochannel areas can be patterned on the oxide layer using photolithography process. The silicon oxide on non-nanochannel areas can be selectively removed but do not affect the oxide on nanochannel area. (See <figref>FIG. 4(</figref><i>c</i>)). This process finishes the second layer of nanochannels. The previous two steps can be repeated to achieve desired number of layers.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0109">As an alternative to the previous steps, the silicon oxide nanochannel spacing layer and multilayer structure layer may also use other materials. For example, an aluminum film as nanochannel spacing layer, and evaporated glass film as multilayer structure layers.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0110">A first mask layer suitable for deep silicon etching can be deposited. The mask layer should be able to be patterned, and have high selectivity to silicon during deep silicon etching process. Depending on the technique for deep silicon etching, a layer of silicon oxide, photoresist, or metal film may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0111">The inlet microchannels are patterned on the first mask layer, and a second mask layer is deposited on the top of first mask layer. The inlet microchannels are patterned on the both first and second mask layers. The outlet microchannels are etched down to a certain depth close to oxide layer of the SOI wafer, and the second mask layer is stripped to expose the first mask layer. The outlet microchannel is etched through multiple layers of the nanochannel spacing layer and structure layer. A combination of wet etching and DRIE may be applied. This will also etch the inlet down to the insulator layer of SOI wafer. (See <figref>FIG. 4(</figref><i>d</i>)). If a silicon wafer is used, the etching depth is determined by etching rate and time. Then the inlet macrochannels on the back are laid out and etched to the oxide layer of SOI wafer (see <figref>FIG. 4</figref> (<i>e</i>)), and the oxide on the exposed areas is cleaned. (See <figref>FIG. 4</figref> (<i>f</i>)).</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0112">To fabricate the top cover of the nanochannel delivery devices, starting with a support wafer (e.g., a silicon wafer), a sacrificial layer is deposited. (See <figref>FIG. 4</figref> (<i>h</i>)). This sacrificial layer is selected so that it can be removed in a solution that is safe for silicon and top cover materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0113">The top cover of the nanochannel delivery device is deposited on the supporting wafer and the inlet microchannels are etched. A lift off technique may be applied for certain cases. (See <figref>FIG. 4</figref> (<i>i,j</i>)). The materials may include, for example, spin-on-glass, sputtered glass, e-beam evaporated glass, ITO-glass sandwich, silicon, etc. The materials should be able to bond to silicon by some means. For instance, a transparent glass layer can be deposited by e-beam evaporation. A spin-on-glass layer may also usable. Depending on the surface quality, a planarization may be needed. The structure wafer from the previous step and the top cover can be bonded together by a technique such as anodic bonding or SiâSi direct bonding or intermediate layer aid bonding. (See <figref>FIG. 4</figref> (<i>k</i>)). The support wafer of top cover can be removed (See <figref>FIG. 4</figref> (<i>l</i>)), and the devices obtained by dicing the wafer and cleaning</p>

      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0114">As a third embodiment, a nanochannel structure can be fabricated monolithically (e.g., without bonding) and optionally utilizing CMP in the process. This exemplary microfabrication protocol comprises the following steps as shown in <figref>FIGS. 5A-5H</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0115">Specific dimensions are provided for purposes of illustration only, and it is understood that other exemplary embodiments may comprise different dimensions. In this embodiment, the top layer is approximately 2 Î¼m of deposited silicon nitride. This embodiment also comprises a bottom wafer that is a 8 inch SOI wafer with a 30 Î¼m device layer, and a 725 Î¼m bulk layer, so that the supporting layer under the nanochannels has 30 Î¼m thickness. In this exemplary structure, the openings for the inlet and outlet microchannels are 3 Î¼m by 5 Î¼m, and the in-plane dimension of each nanochannel is 3 Î¼m by 5 Î¼m. The space between adjacent microchannel openings is 2 Î¼m. As in previously-described embodiments, the inlet macrochannel under the support network is approximately 200 Î¼m by 200 Î¼m up through the 725 Î¼m thick bulk layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0116">Starting with an SOI (silicon on insulator) wafer <b>210</b>, a nanochannel spacing layer <b>220</b> (with a thickness that is well controlled, for example, Â±5% over the relevant portion of SOI wafer <b>210</b>) is deposited. The thickness of spacing layer <b>220</b> can be used to define the height of the nanochannels. This spacing layer <b>220</b> is a sacrificial layer, and the material will be removed in a subsequent step, so the silicon surface immediately under it is the âfloorâ of the eventually formed nanochannels. The spacing material should have a high wet etch selectivity to other materials in the nanochannel delivery device (nDD). As an example, a thin film of tungsten, germanium, or silicon oxide can be used for the nanochannel spacing layer <b>220</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0117">As shown in <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>, a capping layer <b>230</b> is deposited over the nanochannel spacing layer <b>220</b>.

Silicon nitride, silicon oxide, silicon carbide, or other material which has a high etch selectivity to the material for spacing layer <b>220</b> may be used for capping layer <b>230</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0118">A mask layer (not shown) suitable for deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) is deposited, and the inlet microchannels <b>240</b> are patterned on the mask layer using photolithography.

Fill material <b>260</b> should have a wet etch with high selectivity to silicon and the material of capping layer <b>230</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, fill material <b>260</b> only needs to fill in the top of inlet microchannels <b>240</b>. A CMP or etch back process can be used to remove the excess fill material <b>260</b> that extends above or outside of inlet microchannels <b>240</b>. The surface of the remaining fill material <b>260</b> should be above the level of spacing layer <b>220</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0120">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 5D</figref>, additional material may be deposited onto capping layer <b>230</b>. The areas of capping layer <b>230</b> and spacing layer <b>220</b> above and between the inlet microchannels <b>240</b> can be patterned using a photolithography process. The spacing layer <b>220</b> and capping layer <b>230</b> outside of the inlet nanochannels <b>240</b> (e.g., regions <b>221</b> and <b>231</b>) can be etched to or slightly below the silicon surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0121">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 5E</figref>, a final capping layer <b>270</b> is deposited over the entire surface of wafer <b>210</b> to provide structural rigidity and seal the sidewalls of the nanochannel areas.

As shown in <figref>FIG. 5F</figref>, a protective layer <b>275</b> is deposited over capping layer <b>270</b> and outlet micro channels <b>280</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0122">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 5G</figref>, wafer <b>210</b> can then be inverted and large openings for inlet macrochannels <b>245</b> on the back of wafer <b>210</b> can be formed by DRIE down to the buried oxide layer <b>250</b> of wafer <b>210</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 5H</figref>, sacrificial and protective layers used during processing (e.g. spacing layer <b>220</b>, fill material <b>260</b>, capping layer <b>270</b>, and portions of oxide layer <b>250</b>) are removed by appropriate processes known in the art. As shown in <figref>FIG. 5H</figref>, when spacing layer <b>220</b> is removed, nanochannels <b>205</b> are formed. The wafers can then be diced to get individual nanochannel delivery devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0123">As illustrated in this embodiment, nanochannels <b>205</b> are in direct fluid communication with inlet microchannels <b>240</b> and outlet microchannels <b>280</b>.

      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0124">As a variant of this protocol, and in analogy to protocol 2 above, a multilayered structure can be built by repeated application of the monolithic top layer process. A plurality of capping layer <b>230</b> and spacing layer <b>220</b> pairs can be deposited. The inlet microchannels can be etched through all layers down to the buried oxide and filled with fill material <b>260</b> and polished as above. The final capping layer <b>270</b> can be applied and outlet microchannels <b>280</b> etched as above.</p>

      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0125">In certain embodiments, Protocol 1 can be modified to make a nanochannel delivery device with different a nanochannel length while keep other features unchanged. An exemplary microfabrication protocol comprises the following steps.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0126">Starting with a SOI (silicon on insulator) wafer, a hard mask layer such as silicon nitride film or LTO (low temperature oxidation) film that will protect the underneath silicon during thermal oxidation process is deposited.

As an alternative, the bottom substrate can also be silicon wafer instead of SOI if the etching process rates are well characterized.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0127">The nanochannel areas can be patterned on the mask layer using photolithography process. (See <figref>FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>)), and the mask materials on nanochannel areas are selectively removed but do not affect underneath silicon. A combination of dry etching, and short time wet etching may be applied for this purpose. A silicon dioxide film (with a well-controlled thickness) is deposited on the bare silicon area by thermal oxidation. The thickness of the oxidation layer defines the height of nanochannels, and the mask layer and oxide is stripped.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0128">A mask layer suitable for potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet etching is deposited, such as silicon nitride. A new mask is designed to lay-out both inlet microchannels and outlet microchannels on the same layer, and the nanochannel length is defined by the spacing between adjacent inlet and outlet microchannels. The mask layer is patterned using the new mask by standard photolithography process. The mask materials on open areas are selectively removed. Then a KOH wet etching is applied to form openings with the slope wall, and the mask layer is stripped. (See <figref>FIG. 6(</figref><i>b</i>)).</p>

      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0151">The following example is provided as an illustration of one non-limiting embodiment of a method of manufacturing a nanochannel delivery device according to Protocol 1 (described above). This example is provided for illustration purposes only and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0152">Processing begins with a double polished 4â³ SOI wafer (available from Silicon Quest). The wafer comprises a device layer that is 30 um thick, &lt;100&gt; orientation P-type, Boron doped, and a 1-10 Ohm-cm surface resistivity, a buried oxide layer that is 0.4 um thick and a handle layer that is 500 um thick, P-type, Boron doped, and 1-10 Ohm-cm surface resistivity. The wafer was cleaned in a fresh Piranha solution (3:1 98% sulfuric acid: 30% hydrogen peroxide, over 100 C) for 10 min, and spun dried. A 50 nm pad oxide layer was then thermally grown on the surface. Then a 100 nm low-stress nitride was deposited on the pad oxide layer by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). The 5 um wide nanochannel patterns were transferred from the photo mask onto the silicon nitride layer by standard photolithography using an EVG 620 aligner. The exposed nitride area was removed by CF4 RIE.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0153">After the photoresist was stripped, the pad oxide was cleaned by dipping in 1:10 HF water solution. Then the wafer was placed in a thermal oxide furnace to grow sacrificial oxide. The thickness of this sacrificial oxide determined the height of nanochannels, i.e. height of nanochannel=0.46*Thickness of Oxide. In this example, a 39 nm oxide was grown for 18 nm nanochannels. Then the nitride and oxide were removed in dilute HF solution. A 3 um thick low temperature oxide (LTO) layer was then deposited on the surface by LPCVD. Then the backside of wafer was protected by 3 um spun-on Futurrex negative photoresist. The LTO on front side was removed in a buffered oxide etch (BOE) solution, and the wafer was cleaned in piranha solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0154">A 500 nm LTO film was deposited on the wafer using LPCVD. The 5 umÃ5 um inlet microchannel patterns were transferred to the LTO film on the device side of wafer using standard lithography on an EVG 620 aligner, and LTO were etched using CF4 RIE. Then the 200 umÃ200 um inlet macrochannel patterns were transferred onto the backside of the wafer, and RIE was done.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0155">After cleaning out the photoresist, deep silicon etching of inlet microchannels was done using an Oerlikon DSE etcher. The etching was stopped on the buried oxide layer. The wafer was flipped over, and attached onto a handle wafer using thermal grease (AI Technology). The 190 umÃ190 um inlet macrochannels were then etched on the Oerlikon DSE etcher, and stopped on the oxide layer. <figref>FIG. 11</figref> shows a SEM image of deep etched 190 um openings. The wafer was detached from the handle wafer, and cleaned. The wafer was dipped in BOE for 5 min to open the buried oxide layer, and spun dried. Then mask LTO films on both sides of wafer were removed in HF water solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0156">A 500 um thick double side polished Pyrex 7740 glass wafer was bonded onto the silicon substrate as a nanochannel cap by anodic bonding using an EVG 520 bonder. The anodic binding was performed at 800 volts, and 325Â° C. for 10 min. <figref>FIG. 12</figref> shows an optical image of the bonded wafer. The bonded wafer pair was adhered on a wafer holder using wax, and backlapping was applied to thin the glass down to 30 um, and then CMP polished to a final thickness of 5-10 um (by Valley Design Corp).</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0157">
        <figref>FIG. 13</figref> shows an optical image of the front surface after polishing. The contrast indicates that nanochannels are open. The 5 umÃ5 um outlet microchannels were formed by CF4/Ar RIE using Ni film as mask layer. To do so, a copper seed layer was firstly deposited on the glass surface. The 5 umÃ5 um outlet microchannel patterns were transferred to the copper film using standard lithography on an EVG 620 aligner, and were wet etched. Then Ni was electroplated onto the patterned copper film. The CF4/Ar RIE was used to etch the inlet microchannels into the glass film to reach the silicon surface. After stripping the mask layer, the wafer was cleaned, and diced using DAD321 Dicing Saw (Disco). The fabricated devices are 6 mmÃ6 mm overall dimension. There are 161 in total 190 umÃ190 um openings arranged in a 3.6 mm diameter circle. Each such opening is connected to 501 in total 5 umÃ5 um inlet channels, and the inlet channels are connected to nanochannel and outlet channels.</p>

      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0158">The following example is provided as an illustration of one non-limiting embodiment of a method of manufacturing a nanochannel delivery device according to Protocol 3 (described above). This example is provided for illustration purposes only and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0159">Processing begins with a double-side polished Silicon On Insulator (SOI) wafer using a 690 um thick base wafer with a top silicon layer thickness of 30 um and a buried oxide thickness of 2 um. This wafer is cleaned with a piranha solution (3:1 98% Sulfuric acid: 30% Hydrogen peroxide, over 100 C) to remove any organic and metal contamination. A smooth (typically &lt;5 A rms), uniform (typically &lt;2% non-uniformity) tungsten metal layer is sputtered on this wafer, using a physical vapor deposition (PVD) process at a temperature of 100 C. The thickness of this tungsten layer is selected to be the height of the nanochannel layer, for example 5 nm.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0160">The nanochannel space layer is then covered by a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) silicon nitride (âSiN1â) with low stress (380 C, appropriate stoichiometry), with a target thickness of 500 nm and a non-uniformity of less than 2%. Positive resist is then spun on, with a thickness of 2 um. The inlet microchannels are exposed in this resist, with the sizes varying from 1 um to over 5 um, as needed. Using this resist, the applied silicon nitride is etched through, along with tungsten, using a conventional C4F8 etch chemistry with appropriate plasma powers, and other reactive and inert gases.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0161">The etch in this process is timed to be deep enough that it goes through the tungsten layer also, which takes a few minutes. Another etch is performed, still using the resist as the mask, to etch a deep via in the silicon that is deep enough to go into the buried oxide. A 5 dep/5 etch per cycle Bosch etch is used in this step since the etch automatically terminates at, and is highly selective to, the buried oxide. A small overetch of 10-20% of the most critical structure is provided to compensate for the non-uniformity of the process. The remaining resist is then removed using an oxygen plasma and the wafers are additionally cleaned of all polymer residues using an appropriate wet chemistry <figref>FIG. 14</figref> presents an example of a device at this stage of process.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0162">The next module consists of filling or capping these inlet microchannels. This can be accomplished by plugging the inlets with copper. A TiN barrier layer is deposited by sputter, with a thickness of 300 A. A copper seed layer, with a nominal thickness of about 4000 A is deposited through a PVD sputter process. A low current (2 A, 10-15 minutes) electroplating process is used to fill or plug the inlet microchannels. The excess copper overburden is then polished away using a pad/slurry combination, under moderate pressure/speed (2-4 psi, 30-90 rpm) process. In this same process, the TiN in the non-microchannel area (field) is also completely removed. Finally, the inlet microchannel process is hardened with a short bake anneal at 150-250 C, for about 30 minutes, and the surface is cleaned. <figref>FIG. 15</figref> presents a top view of the device after filling with copper.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0163">A thin silicon nitride (âSiN2â) layer of about 50 nm is deposited by PECVD to cap the copper. The nanochannel lines are then exposed in resist (1.3 um) using photolithography and the silicon nitride (SiN1 as well as SiN2) layers are etched, along with the tungsten nanochannel material, with the etch proceeding a few tens of nanometers into the silicon.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0164">A thicker, tensile silicon nitride (âSiN3â) is then deposited, of a thickness of about 1-1.5 um. The tensile stress of this layer is chosen so as to make the overall dielectric stack slightly tensile by about 20 MPa. The outlet microchannels are then exposed on a resist layer (of nominal thickness 2 um) and a further etch of all silicon nitride layers (SiN1, SiN2, SiN3) along with the W nanochannel layer are etched so that the bottom of the outlet microchannels end in the device silicon. The resist is stripped after this stage. <figref>FIG. 16</figref> presents a cross-section of a device at this stage of processing.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0165">An appropriate protection layer is applied to the surfaceâTi/TiN (250/300 A), Tungsten (5000 A) followed by Phospho silicate Glass (PSG) of thickness of 1 um, which can be used as both an HF protectant as well as a surface protectant. The wafer is then turned upside down and a thick resist (10 um) is spun on. Using the front side alignment marks, macrochannels are exposed on the backside. The macrochannels are etched all the way through the wafer (about 700 um) using a Bosch DRIE process. This process lands on the buried oxide, which forms an effective etch stop. <figref>FIG. 17</figref> presents a cross-section of a test device at this stage of processing. This buried oxide is then removed by a plasma etch.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0166">A series of wet etches are done to remove all the sacrificial materials. A short buffered HF etch, for about 5 minutes, is done to remove any residual oxide (of the buried oxide), as well as to remove the PSG layer. The wafers are then wet-etched in an SC-1 solution (hot Ammonium hydroxide-hydrogen peroxide mixture) for about 10 minutes to remove the TiN barrier at the top surface as well as at the bottom of the inlet microchannels. The wafers are subjected to a piranha etch for about 20 minutes to remove the copper in the inlet microchannels. This is followed by another SC-1 etch to remove all the TiN from the sidewalls of the inlet microchannels. Finally, the Tungsten is removed from the nanochannels by placing the wafers in wafer hydrogen peroxide for 2 hours, followed by a rinse with DI water. The wafers are then cleaned with Iso-Propyl Alcohol (IPA) to displace the water with IPA, and the wafers are allowed to dry.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0167">Material Selection</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0168">Regardless of the protocol used to manufacture the nanochannel delivery device, the materials used during the manufacturing process should be selected to successfully remove sacrificial materials while leaving the non-sacrificial materials. As shown in <figref>FIG. 18</figref>, the selection of a nanochannel âplaceholderâ (e.g., the sacrificial material used to fill the space of the nanochannel) and nanochannel âceilingâ and âfloorâ materials (e.g., the substrate and capping layers) should be coordinated with the selection of a solvent or etchant. Examples of suitable solvents and etchants that can be used to remove sacrificial materials while leaving the substrate and capping layers are shown in <figref>FIG. 18</figref>. It is understood that other combinations of materials may be utilized as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0169">Post Wafer Processing</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0170">During post wafer processing, each wafer is attached to a tape-ring with an adhesive tape. A UV release tape is preferred since it has better adhesion. Since both surfaces of the wafer have critical device structures, UV tape is attached to both top and bottom surfaces. The wafers are then diced into individual die and cleaned. The tapeframe is then exposed to a UV light source to decrease the adhesion of the tape to the surface. The dice are individually picked and placed into a bare-die holder using an automated pick and place sorter tool. The tape on the top surface of the die is subsequently peeled off manually. The dice are then individually placed in a final clean container and cleaned with acetone with a final rinse of IPA to promote channel drying. A die is attached by epoxy or other fixing method to a capsule mating surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0171">Capsule Configurations</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0172">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>, nanochannel delivery device <b>500</b> may form part of a larger assembly, e.g., a capsule <b>600</b> that may be used to administer drugs or other therapeutic agents to a patient. <figref>FIG. 19</figref> shows a detailed view of one end of capsule <b>600</b> in an exploded view, while <figref>FIG. 20</figref> illustrates an assembled view of capsule <b>600</b>. It is understood that in other embodiments, nanochannel delivery device <b>500</b> may be used in other applications where it is desired to precisely control the diffusion or passage of small amounts of any substance.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0173">In the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>, capsule <b>600</b> comprises a generally cylindrical body <b>620</b> having an end portion <b>630</b> configured to receive a first cap <b>610</b> and a second cap <b>625</b>. In this embodiment, nanochannel delivery device <b>500</b> is installed in a plane that is perpendicular to the primary axis of capsule <b>600</b> (e.g., an axis that is parallel to the length of cylindrical body <b>620</b> and concentric with cylindrical body <b>620</b>). End portion <b>630</b> also comprises a recessed portion <b>640</b> configured to receive nanochannel delivery device <b>500</b>. In certain embodiments, a glue or other boding agent may be used to secure nanochannel delivery device <b>500</b> in recessed portion <b>640</b>. When assembled, nanochannel delivery device <b>500</b> can be inserted into recessed portion <b>640</b>, and first cap <b>610</b> may be fitted onto end portion <b>630</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0174">During use, drugs (or any other substance administered via capsule <b>600</b>) can pass from cylindrical body <b>620</b> to nanochannel delivery device via an inner volume <b>650</b> contained within cylindrical body <b>620</b>. After diffusing through nanochannel delivery device <b>500</b> and into first cap <b>610</b>, the administered substances can exit cap <b>610</b> via exit ports <b>615</b>. In exemplary embodiments, the dimensions of exit ports <b>615</b> (and other aspects of capsule <b>610</b>, such as inner volume <b>650</b> and cap <b>610</b>) are large enough so that these features do not restrict the diffusion of the administered substance from capsule <b>600</b>. As a result, the diffusion of the administered substance can be more precisely controlled by selecting the dimensions of nanochannel delivery device <b>500</b>, particularly the dimensions of nanochannels <b>505</b>. Cap <b>610</b> may also provide dimensional rigidity and protect nanochannel delivery device <b>500</b> from mechanical damage and the incursion of biological tissue structures after implantation.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0175">In certain embodiments, inner volume <b>650</b> is configured to minimize capture points for air bubbles. For example, inner volume <b>650</b> may comprise radiused corners and surfaces that are not angled in a manner (when capsule <b>600</b> is installed) which could trap air bubbles.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0176">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>, capsule <b>700</b> is similar to the previously-described capsule <b>600</b>.

Septum <b>760</b> comprises a self-sealing material (e.g., silicone rubber) that permits injection of a therapeutic agent into inner volume <b>750</b> of cylindrical body <b>720</b>. In certain embodiments, a therapeutic agent can be injected with a hypodermic needle just prior to implantation of capsule <b>700</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0177">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 23</figref>, a capsule <b>800</b> comprises components equivalent to previously-described embodiments.

In other embodiments, the capsule may have a length greater than 200 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0189">It is noted that the various embodiments of capsules described in this disclosure comprise a cross-section that is nominally constant along the length of the capsule. Such an optional configuration can facilitate sliding removal from a surgical site within the body without damage to surrounding tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0190">In exemplary embodiments a capsule may comprise suitable materials such as stainless steel, titanium, polyetheretherkeytone, polysulfone, and other plastics and metals. In certain embodiments, a capsule may comprise coating(s) on the interior to provide an optimal environment for a therapeutic substance and/or coating(s) on the exterior to prevent deleterious tissue encapsulation. In specific embodiments, the capsule may comprise color coding to indicate the model of the capsule or a particular characteristic (e.g., the therapeutic agent, rate of administering the agent, the capacity of the capsule, etc.). In certain embodiments, a capsule may comprise a translucent or transparent portion or component (e.g. a cap) to facilitate observation of the quantity of therapeutic agent contained within the capsule. For example, a translucent or transparent cap covering the nanochannel delivery device can allow a person to confirm the capsule is full by orienting the capsule so that the nanochannel delivery device is positioned towards the top of the capsule. A needle (or other loading device) can then penetrate the septum and the therapeutic agent can be injected into the capsule. When liquid appears on the top of the nanochannel delivery device (as viewed through the cap), the person filling the capsule will have an indication that the capsule is full.</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="2">In-Vivo Refill Capability</heading>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0191">In certain applications of the nanochannel delivery device in a capsule, the duration of implant may be advantageously extended by refilling the capsule while it remains in vivo. This facilitates the use of a shorter lifetime therapeutic agent which needs to be regularly replaced or a lower concentration therapeutic agent which needs to be regularly replenished. In some treatments, the minor surgical procedure of explanting and re-implanting a capsule can be replaced by a simpler refilling operation. Refill capability for the nanochannel device in a capsule should account for the operational characteristics of the system, including features and methods to support the refill procedure.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0192">In exemplary embodiments, a capsule using a nanochannel device releases molecules from within the capsule through the nanochannel device into the body; the contained fluid is generally not moved in or out of the capsule. The primary diffusion from the capsule is that of the molecules of the therapeutic agent. The vessel walls of a capsule using a nanochannel device should be stiff enough to prevent a volume change that would inadvertently âpumpâ fluid in or out. When a significant fraction of the therapeutic agent has diffused out of the capsule, the capsule is still filled with the carrier fluid. Replacing this expended fluid with new fluid containing more therapeutic agent should occur with the volume of the capsule remaining nominally constant. Otherwise, either an internal low pressure can be created that can draw body fluids into the capsule or an internal high pressure can be created that can expel the carrier fluid into the body.</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0193">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 32A-32C</figref>, one embodiment with in vivo refill capability comprises a collapsible bladder <b>1510</b> located within a capsule <b>1500</b> having a first end <b>1501</b>, a second end <b>1502</b> and a primary axis <b>1503</b>. <figref>FIG. 32A</figref> provides a cross-section view of capsule <b>1500</b>, while <figref>FIGS. 32B and 32C</figref> provide perspective views of cylindrical and disc-shaped embodiments, respectively. It is understood that disc-shaped embodiments are not limited to the circular shape shown in <figref>FIG. 32C</figref>, but also includes other shapes, e.g., circular or rectangular.</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0194">In exemplary embodiments, collapsible bladder <b>1510</b> can be constructed of a biocompatible elastic material, e.g. silicone, and line the interior surface of capsule <b>1500</b>. Bladder <b>1510</b> can be filled with a therapeutic agent and then capsule <b>1500</b> implanted in vivo into a patient (e.g. subcutaneously). During use, therapeutic agent molecules may exit the interior of bladder <b>1510</b> through a nanochannel delivery device <b>1550</b>, which is in fluid communication with bladder <b>1510</b>. Nanochannel delivery device <b>1550</b> can control the diffusion rate of the therapeutic molecules as described in the embodiments above.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0195">Refill access to an inner bladder volume <b>1512</b> of bladder <b>1510</b> can be provided through a port <b>1514</b> which extends through both capsule <b>1500</b> and bladder <b>1510</b>. In exemplary embodiments, port <b>1514</b> may comprise a septum <b>1524</b> that can be penetrated by a needle <b>1534</b>. In specific embodiments, septum <b>1524</b> is self-sealing when punctured by a needle.</p>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0196">In certain embodiments, capsule <b>1500</b> comprises a second port <b>1516</b> placed on the same side of capsule <b>1500</b> as port <b>1514</b>. As used herein the âsideâ of capsule <b>1500</b> may include, but is not limited to, generally flat surfaces shown in <figref>FIG. 32C</figref>. For example, if capsule <b>1500</b> is generally cylindrical as shown in <figref>FIG. 32B</figref> (e.g., circular in shape when viewed from ends <b>1501</b> or <b>1502</b>), ports <b>1514</b> and <b>1516</b> are on the same side of capsule <b>1500</b> if they are generally aligned when viewed from end <b>1501</b> or <b>1502</b>. Stated another way, a reference line <b>1504</b> connecting ports <b>1514</b> and <b>1516</b> is generally parallel to primary axis <b>1503</b>. If capsule <b>1500</b> is generally disc-shaped (e.g. surfaces <b>1508</b> or <b>1509</b> are generally flat) as shown in <figref>FIG. 32C</figref>, then ports <b>1514</b> and <b>1516</b> are on the same side if they are both located on either surface <b>1508</b> or <b>1509</b>. In other embodiments comprising a disc-shaped capsule similar to that shown in <figref>FIG. 32C</figref>, the ports may be on the surfaces indicated by reference numbers <b>1501</b> and <b>1502</b> (i.e. the ends or âedgesâ of the disc-shape), rather than surfaces <b>1508</b> or <b>1509</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0197">Placing ports <b>1514</b> and <b>1516</b> on the same side of capsule <b>1500</b> allows accessibility to both ports externally from the outside of the patient's body. This configuration also provides access via port <b>1516</b> to a capsule volume <b>1513</b> that is exterior of bladder <b>1510</b>, but within capsule <b>1500</b>, to provide backfill air, fluid, etc., so that bladder <b>1510</b> may collapse as the expended carrier fluid is withdrawn from bladder <b>1510</b>. In the embodiment shown, port <b>1516</b> extends through capsule <b>1500</b> but does not extend through bladder <b>1510</b>. Port <b>1516</b> therefore provides access to capsule volume <b>1513</b> but does not provide access to inner bladder volume <b>1512</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0198">An example refill procedure includes: (1) palpating and orienting capsule <b>1500</b> so that ports <b>1514</b> and <b>1516</b> are easily accessed (e.g. directed towards the closest external skin surface of the patient); (2) inserting a backfill needle into the backfill port; (3) inserting an evacuation needle <b>1534</b> through port <b>1514</b> and septum <b>1524</b> into inner bladder volume <b>1512</b> of bladder <b>1510</b>; (4) withdrawing the fluid contained within inner bladder volume <b>1512</b> of bladder <b>1510</b> via needle <b>1534</b>; (5) withdrawing needle <b>1534</b> from port <b>1514</b> and septum <b>1524</b>; (6) inserting needle <b>1536</b> through port <b>1516</b> and septum <b>1526</b>; and (7) inserting a refill needle <b>1544</b> (which is coupled to a reservoirâe.g., a syringeâwith new a therapeutic agent) through port <b>1514</b> and septum <b>1516</b>; (8) injecting the new therapeutic agent fluid into the inner bladder volume <b>1512</b> of bladder <b>1510</b>; (9) removing the needles <b>1544</b> and <b>1536</b>. This embodiment may also contain internal protection features to prevent the backfill, evacuation, or refill needles from touching, puncturing, or otherwise damaging the bladder.</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0199">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 33</figref>, another embodiment with in vivo refill capability comprises a capsule <b>1600</b> with a nanochannel delivery device <b>1650</b>, a first end <b>1601</b>, a second end <b>1602</b> and two separated ports <b>1614</b> and <b>1616</b>. As in the previous embodiments, nanochannel delivery device <b>1650</b> can control the diffusion of molecules of a therapeutic agent from capsule <b>1650</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0200">In this embodiment, capsule <b>1600</b> does not comprise an internal bladder as described in the previous embodiment, but is generally equivalent in other aspects. Capsule <b>1600</b> comprises a first port <b>1614</b> with a septum <b>1624</b> and a second port <b>1616</b> with a septum <b>1626</b> that are placed on the same side of capsule <b>1600</b> (in a manner similar to that described in the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 32A-32C</figref>). Capsule <b>1600</b> can be implanted in a patient and refilled with a therapeutic agent in the manner described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0201">With capsule <b>1600</b> implanted in a patient and ports <b>1614</b> and <b>1624</b> aligned to allow external access, a first needle <b>1634</b> can be used to inject new therapeutic fluid while a second needle <b>1636</b> can be used to withdraw the expended fluid. First needle <b>1634</b> can be inserted through the patient's skin and port <b>1614</b> so that it is in fluid communication with an inner volume <b>1613</b> of capsule <b>1600</b>. In addition, second needle <b>1636</b> can be inserted through the patient's skin and port <b>1616</b> so that it is in fluid communication with inner volume <b>1613</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00203-en" num="0202">In one exemplary embodiment, first needle <b>1634</b> is coupled to a syringe containing new (i.e., fresh, unused) therapeutic agent, while second needle <b>1636</b> is coupled to an empty syringe that can be used to withdraw fluid from inner volume <b>1613</b>. The plunger of the empty syringe can be pulled back slightly to create a small vacuum and then the plunger of the syringe with the new therapeutic agent is depressed to force the new therapeutic agent fluid through needle <b>1634</b> and into capsule <b>1600</b>. The expended fluid inside capsule <b>1600</b> will be expelled through needle <b>1636</b> and into the empty syringe. In this manner, inner volume <b>1613</b> of capsule <b>1600</b> can be filled with the new therapeutic agent. Since any residual expended fluid may dilute the new therapeutic agent, the new therapeutic agent syringe coupled to needle <b>1634</b> could contain a larger volume than inner volume <b>1613</b> of capsule <b>1600</b>. This can insure a suitably high fraction of the final contents in capsule <b>1600</b> comprises the new therapeutic agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0203">In certain embodiments, an optional washout fluid may be injected through port <b>1614</b> and withdrawn through port <b>1616</b> prior to the introduction of the new therapeutic agent fluid to further eliminate residual expended fluid. In specific embodiments, ports <b>1614</b> and <b>1616</b> should be maximally separated (e.g., first port <b>1614</b> is proximal to first end <b>1601</b> and second port <b>1616</b> is proximal to second end <b>1602</b>) for efficient expulsion of the expended fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00205-en" num="0204">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 34</figref>, an exemplary embodiment comprises a capsule <b>1700</b> comprising a nanochannel delivery device <b>1750</b>, a single port <b>1716</b> and septum <b>1726</b> that provides access for both extracting expended fluid from capsule <b>1700</b> and injecting new therapeutic agent into capsule <b>1700</b>. In this embodiment, a double or dual lumen needle <b>1735</b> (comprising first lumen <b>1734</b> and second lumen <b>1736</b>) may be used to inject and extract material.</p>
      <p id="p-00206-en" num="0205">In certain embodiments, first lumen <b>1734</b> comprises an end portion <b>1744</b> that extends farther into capsule <b>1700</b> than does end portion <b>1746</b> of second lumen <b>1736</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 34</figref>, first lumen <b>1734</b> extends into capsule <b>1750</b> a distance of D<b>2</b>, which is greater than distance D<b>1</b> that second lumen <b>1744</b> extends into capsule <b>1700</b>. With this configuration, first lumen <b>1734</b> can be used to extract or withdraw expended fluid from capsule <b>1700</b> and second lumen <b>1736</b> can be used to inject new therapeutic agent into capsule <b>1700</b> (or vice versa). With end portions <b>1744</b> and <b>1746</b> sufficiently separated within capsule <b>1700</b>, the injection and extraction of material can be performed at the same time so that the new material displaces the expended material in an effort to maintain a constant volume and pressure within capsule <b>1700</b>.</p>

      <heading id="h-00015-en" level="1">Example 1</heading>
      <p id="p-00208-en" num="0207">The capsule as described herein is used to administer leuprolide acetate for the treatment of prostate cancer. Leuprolide acetate (USP 31) is a synthetic nonapeptide agonist analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing factor (LNHR). The leuprolide acetate molecule is approximately 1209 Daltons in weight and two to three nanometers in size. It is soluble in aqueous media at a level of approximately 10 mg/mL. An existing method of administering leuprolide via extended release is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,396 filed Jan. 30, 1997 and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0208">The nanochannel delivery device chip is installed in a capsule as described herein and filled with a 5 mg/mL leuprolide acetate solution (NDC number 0703-4014-18) for use in the treatment of prostate cancer. The capsule is sized to approximately 2.8 mL, so that the filled capsule contains approximately 14 mg of leuprolide acetate. If stronger concentrations of leuprolide acetate solution are used, the capsule volume may be correspondingly reduced. The capsule is implanted subcutaneously in the inner portion of the upper arm or upper leg or in the abdomen. The capsule is implanted, with optional use of a tissue separator, through a small incision in a clinical outpatient procedure and removed two to three months later through a small incision. For implant and explant, a small amount of anesthetic is used, for example, a 1% lidocaine injection at the site.</p>
      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0209">The micro- and nano-channel sizes of the nanochannel delivery device are chosen (for example, according to the model described in [Grattoni, A. Ferrari, M., Liu, X. Quality control method for micro-nano-channels silicon devices. U.S. Patent Application No. 61/049,287 (April 2008)]), to provide a release rate of about 120 Î¼g/day can be obtained for about 90 days in certain embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0210">In this example, the nanochannel delivery device configuration with this behavior uses a 6Ã6 mm chip size, with 161 macrochannels with openings of 190Ã190 Î¼m each, and within each macrochannel approximately 23 rows of nanochannel structures, consisting of 10 each of inlet and outlet microchannels, connected through about 20 nanochannels according to the description herein. The inlets and outlets are approximately 5Ã5 Î¼m in cross-section, with the inlets being about 30 Î¼m long and the outlets being about 1.6 Î¼m long, and the nanochannels are about 5 Î¼m long and 5 Î¼m wide and 13 nm high. Other configurations with different dimensions may be derived from the mathematical model that yield approximately the same release rate and duration in other examples.</p>

      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0211">The capsule and nanochannel delivery device are configured and implanted as described in Example 1. However, instead of administering leuprolide acetate, the capsule and nanochannel delivery device administer letrozole for the treatment of breast cancer. The limited success of chemotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer emphasizes the need of novel preventive strategies to minimize the cancer occurrence. Recent studies have highlighted that aromatase inhibitors are promising chemopreventive agents for breast cancer through inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis. In particular, research has suggested that letrozole is an ideal candidate for chemoprevention for women in high risk group such as BRCA1 positive. However, the low efficacy and the side effects associated with the conventional systemic administration of letrozole are limiting factors for its long term usage.</p>
      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0212">Breast cancer growth is highly dependent on estrogen, and thus inhibition of estrogen is highly effective for the prevention of breast tumor development. Recent studies have highlighted aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane, as promising molecules that can be used for chemoprevention of breast cancer. Aromatase mediates biosynthesis of estradiol, the most potent form of estrogen, from androgens by the cytochrome P450 enzyme complex (Aromatase). Aromatase is present in breast tissue and the nonsteroidal and steroidal aromatase inhibitors reduce circulating estrogen level to 1% to 10% of pretreatment levels, respectively. Therefore, inhibition of aromatase is an important approach for reducing growth-stimulatory effects of estrogens in estrogen-dependent breast cancer, which constitutes approximately 60-70% of breast cancer. Among the aromatase inhibitors, letrozole is a highly potent non-steroid inhibitor which inhibits approximately 99% of estrogen biosynthesis. Additionally, several studies and clinical trials on chemotherapy of metastatic breast cancer indicated higher efficacy with fewer side effects of letrozole when compared to Tamoxifen. Hence, research suggests letrozole as a candidate for the development of chemopreventive therapy for women at increased risk of breast cancer. However, the conventional oral administration of letrozole showed increased risk of heart problems and osteoporosis. The key for the success of chemoprevention for breast cancer relies on long term delivery of specific drugs while circumventing side effects. As opposed to the inefficient oral administration, a constant local release of chemopreventive agent (i.e. letrozole) in breast tissue could significantly reduce occurrence of breast tumor as well as systemic side effects. This shows promise for improvement in patient quality of life.</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0213">It is believed that the implantable nanochanneled devices according to the present disclosure will allow the constant and sustained local release of letrozole in breast tissues and significant reduction of estrogen dependent epithelial cell proliferation with minimum toxicities.</p>
      <p id="p-00215-en" num="0214">Prior clinical trials employed letrozole daily doses of 2.5 mg. It is believed that the constant local release of letrozole in breast tissues (utilizing nanochanneled devices according to the present disclosure) would require lower dosage if compared to oral delivery. In first analysis it is believed that a local daily release in the range 25 to 50 ug could be effective.</p>
      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0215">The achievement of an efficient chemopreventive therapy by the use of long-term, constant release implants for local administration of chemopreventive agents will have significant impact on the quality of life of women in the high risk group. It is believed that use of nanochannel delivery devices according to the present disclosure will lead to improved efficacy of therapy, as well as potential reduction of drug doses and reduction of side effects through true constant release. A reduction in the number of breast cancer occurrences due to effective preventive therapy would also have a positive economic impact on patients, their employers and insurers through lowered cost of treatment, fewer medical visits, and less work time lost.</p>
      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0216">The development of a reliable extended release implantable technology adds a new dimension to drug delivery for breast cancer. Tumor treatment and the suppression of metastasis and/or tumor recurrence are natural follow-on developments. Technology enhancements to the initial platform could support variable and programmed release, including remote, interactive control of the implanted device, further enabling capabilities to deploy multiple drugs simultaneously. In vivo refilling could also extend the functionality of the nanochannel device and also decrease adverse events associated with explanation. As a general drug delivery method, other indications may be identified, broadening the applicability of the innovation.</p>
      <heading id="h-00017-en" level="1">Example 3</heading>
      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0217">The capsule and nanochannel delivery device are configured and implanted in a patient as described in Example 1. However, instead of administering leuprolide acetate, the capsule and nanochannel delivery device administer lapatinib for the treatment of breast cancer.</p>
      <heading id="h-00018-en" level="1">Example 4</heading>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0218">The capsule and nanochannel delivery device are configured and implanted in a patient as described in Example 1.

      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0219">The capsule and nanochannel delivery device are configured and implanted in a patient as described in Example 1. However, instead of administering leuprolide acetate, the capsule and nanochannel delivery device administer interferon alpha implant for giant cell angioblastoma.</p>
      <heading id="h-00020-en" level="1">Example 6</heading>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0220">The capsule and nanochannel delivery device are configured and implanted in a patient as described in Example 1. However, instead of administering leuprolide acetate, the capsule and nanochannel delivery device administer zidovudine in an intravaginal treatment for preventing HIV being transmitted from a pregnant mother to a child.</p>
      <heading id="h-00021-en" level="1">Example 7</heading>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0221">The capsule and nanochannel delivery device are configured and implanted in a patient as described in Example 1. However, instead of administering leuprolide acetate, the capsule and nanochannel delivery device administer methotrexate for the treatment of certain neoplastic diseases, including for example, adult rheumatoid arthritis and severe psoriasis.</p>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0222">The recommended treatment of adult rheumatoid arthritis is 7.5 mg once weekly. This dose translates to approximately 1.07 mg per day given continuously. The methotrexate molecule has a molecular weight of 454 Da and the potential nanochannel size for constant delivery is approximately 2 nm.</p>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0223">At the dose of 1.07 mg per day, the nanochannel delivery device chip has approximately 806,442 nanochannels with microchannel dimensions of 1 Î¼m by 3 Î¼m with a nanochannel length of 1 Î¼m. If the implant contains the equivalent of 122 mg/ml concentration of methotrexate, the resulting implant volume is approximately 3 cc for one year of treatment. The recommended treatment for severe psoriasis is 10 to 25 mg once per week. For the case of 25 mg per week, this results in a continuous delivery of approximately 3.57 mg per day. At the daily dose 3.57 mg per day the nanochannel delivery device chip for this application would have approximately 2,866,500 nanochannels with microchannel dimensions of 1 Î¼m by 3 Î¼m with a nanochannel length of 1 Î¼m.</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0224">If the implant contains the equivalent of 434 mg/ml concentration of methotrexate, the resulting implant volume is approximately 3 cc for one year of treatment. A common neoplastic disease treatment is 15 to 30 mg per day for 5 days then a one week rest period, after the week of rest the treatment is repeated and the cycle repeated 3 to 5 times. If the mexthotrexate is delivered continuously and the rest periods are no longer needed, the nanochannel delivery device can be designed to deliver 30 mg per day for the 25 days of treatment time. The nanochannel delivery device chip for this application would contain approximately 28,665,000 nanochannels with microchannel dimensions of 1 Î¼m by 3 Î¼m with a nanochannel length of 1 Î¼m. If the equivalent of 250 mg/ml of methotrexate is used the implant volume would be approximately 3 cc for the 25 day treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0225">As used herein, the term âdirect fluid communicationâ is interpreted as fluid communication between two bodies that are directly connected, e.g. such that fluid may exit one body and immediately enter the second body without flowing through an intermediate body. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 3A-3G</figref>, outlet <b>70</b> is in direct fluid communication with nanochannel <b>25</b>. However, outlet <b>70</b> is not in direct fluid communication with inlet <b>30</b>, because fluid must flow through an intermediate body (nanochannel <b>25</b>) after exiting inlet <b>30</b> and before entering outlet <b>70</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0226">Furthermore, as used herein, the term âinletâ is interpreted as a chamber or reservoir within a nanochannel delivery device that initially retains a substance being delivered via the nanochannel delivery device. Similarly, an âoutletâ is interpreted as a chamber or reservoir within a nanochannel delivery device that retains a substance immediately prior to the substance exiting the nanochannel delivery device.</p>
