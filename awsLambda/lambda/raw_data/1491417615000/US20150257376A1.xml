      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to tackle boxes for fishing and, more particularly, to a combination tackle box and cooler.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Fishing is one of the most prolific pastimes in the United States today. First a necessity for food and survival, it evolved into the ancient lazy sport of watching a bobber or float and hoping that it is pulled down by âthe big oneâ. Now the sport is enhanced by modern techniques and technology such as the use of electronic fish finders, chemical attractants, high-powered bass boats, the latest sure-fire lures and bait, high tech rods and reels containing carbon fiber and graphite, and sophisticated lines bearing well-known trade names. Fishing equipment is now very big business.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">A variety of fishing shows on television promote the latest equipment, techniques, and taxidermy. These shows are often hosted by seasoned professional tournament fishermen, willing to share their secrets of success. A number of fishing magazines also support the industry.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Tackle and equipment are sold on commercials, infomercials, and through huge catalog houses. These catalog houses also have a chain of retail outlets, which compete in product offerings with every major sporting goods store, and the industry retail giants.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Fishing is advertised as being very relaxing, unless one is frantically involved in a professional tournament and competing for the large prize purses offered. Fishing as a sport is still a great way for a parent to spend time with a child.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Possibly inspired by the blitz of advertising, some fishermen and women carry tons of equipment with them including rods, tackle box, coolers, chairs and bait box. It becomes difficult to carry the vast array, especially to discrete âsecret spots. And, when the fishing is slow, the fisherman often will try to find a âYâ shaped stick to prop up his rod, and try to find a dry and comfortable spot to sit back and relax. Of course, this is difficult on rocky or wet ground, or on the hard surface of a dock or pier. In spite of all this, there is a common expression that âa bad day of fishing beats a good day of workâ. It takes a lot of room to transport all this equipment and on an off day, it is also difficult to store it all.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Fishing tackle boxes and the lures stored inside come in many shapes and sizes. So do chairs, coolers, and also bait carrying containers. Bait such as minnows, worms, and leaches must be refrigerated to stay alive and active, which is required to attract the finicky fish. These require insulated carriers.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Tired of standing, and lacking an chair, many a fisherman has sat on their tackle box to fish. Many, like these inventors, have broken expensive boxes doing just that. Not only are current products not built to sit on, but they tend to be very difficult to do so anyway. Most are short in height and sitting on them is uncomfortable. Your legs are either stretched straight out, or bent with your knees in your chest. Most also employ a handle right in the center of the top side, right where a person would place their backside.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Others have addressed these problems with inferior solutions. For example, many tackle boxes have add-on rod holders. Some place the rod straight up, where it is difficult to watch the sensitive rod tip for the slightest strike from the fish. Most boxes also have narrow bases, so that if a big one did strike, the box would tumble over. Some have hardware bolted on to place the rod out an angle. This is better for watching the rod tip, but unwieldy and can catch clothing and skin.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">A number of known designs can be used for sitting, except for the ones with hardware mounted on top side. One known combination tackle box, bait holder, cooler and seat means is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,128,170 to Charles Elliott. However, these known designs have not had cut out areas for the legs to fit in between. There are also bait buckets with a seat on top side, again they are not wide at the base nor do they have cut out areas for the legs. Most do not employ a wide seat area.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Known coolers with drawers underneath are wide at the top side and base, but also do not have recesses for the legs. One also cannot access the bait or coolers in any of these known designs without standing up to open them, and bending over to reach inside. This means you can't watch the rod tip at the same time, and could miss the opportunity to catch the fish. This cooler also presents a real problem with cleaning. To tilt it and clean the cooler in a sink, the lures and tackle in the drawers can get all jumbled and tangles.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">There is a continuing need for a tackle cool box product having a tackle box, cooler for bait, separate cooler for beverages or food, a chair, a rod holder and a can holder combined into one smartly integrated package. Desirably, the product has a sturdy construction with four legs for seating, integral tackle compartments inside a lid, removable tackle compartment in a base, two compartment coolers removable for cleaning and accessible while seated for bait and/or food and beverages, a locking handle to keep the cooler from sliding out during transport, integral can holders and rod holders in the legs that are accessible while seated, and a watertight lid for wet weather fishing.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In concordance with the instant disclosure, a tackle cool box product having a tackle box, cooler for bait, separate cooler for beverages or food, a chair, a rod holder, and a can holder that are combined into one smartly integrated package having a sturdy construction with four legs for seating, integral tackle compartments inside a lid, removable tackle compartment in a base, two compartment coolers removable for cleaning and accessible while seated for bait and/or food and beverages, a locking handle to keep the cooler from sliding out during transport, integral can holders and rod holders in the legs that are accessible while seated, and a watertight lid for wet weather fishing, has been surprisingly discovered.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In one embodiment, a tackle cool box has a main body and a cooler. The main body has a top side, a bottom side, a first side with a first opening, and a second side with a second opening. The cooler is slidably attached to the bottom side of the main body. The cooler having a first chamber and a second chamber. The cooler is slidable to each of a closed position, a first open position, and a second open position. In the closed, position, the first chamber and the second chamber of the cooler are both disposed between the first side and the second side of the main body. In the first open position, the first chamber is at least partly disposed at a location laterally outwardly from the first opening of the main body, and the second chamber is disposed between the first side and the second side of the main body. In the second open position, the second chamber is at least partly disposed at a location laterally outwardly from the second opening of the main body, and the first chamber is disposed between the first side and the second side of the main body.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In another embodiment, the tackle cool box includes a lid that is hingedly attached to the main body. The lid is rotatable from an open position to a closed position. The open position permits access to a recess formed in the top side of the main body. The closed position seals the recess formed in the top side of the main body. An outer surface of the lid is free of protrusions and permit one to comfortably sit on the outer surface of the lid. An inner surface of the lid has a plurality of compartments formed therein. A cover is also removably attached to the inner surface of the lid. The cover is configured to selectively close the compartments. The cover may also be transparent, and is disposed between the recess and the lid where the lid is in the closed position.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In a further embodiment, the tackle cool box has a handle that is rotatably connected to the first side and the second side of the main body. The handle is rotatable between a substantially upright position and a stored position. The handle in the substantially upright position is spaced apart from the top side of the main body. The handle in the stored position is adjacent a rear of the main body. A first end of the handle has a first bottom side extension, and a second end of the handle has a second bottom side extension. The first bottom side extension and the second bottom side extension militate against a movement of the cooler from the closed position where the handle is in a substantially upright position.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The tackle cool box product of the present disclosure is designed to be a totally integrated fishing solution. In exemplary embodiments, the product features a tackle box on legs to achieve a more comfortable sitting position while fishing. The legs are spaced so that the fisherman's legs fit comfortably between them. The top side surface is free of protrusions or a handle that would otherwise cause discomfort.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Also, the product has a segregated cooler underneath. One insulated side can be filled with beverages and ice, or hot meals with a heat pack. The other insulated side can contain minnows in water, worms kept cool by ice, cold drinks, or hot sandwiches. In common coolers, it often happens that bait is stored with the beverages. Dirt from the worm container can make a real mess and render the ice unusable for drinking purposes. This cooler is divided to keep each item completely separate. Food can also be kept from the water made by melting ice by keeping the food in the other side.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The tackle cool box is also unique in that the cooler can slide out to either side. The fisherman can remain comfortably seated, never move his legs, and pull the cooler out to one side to access a drink. Still seated, the cooler can be pushed to the other side for a sandwich or bait. When the cooler is moved to the center, the handle can be raised to lock it in place. The cooler also can be completely removed for easy washing in a sink.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Dual-purpose can holders and rod holders are built integrally into each of the front legs. These do not protrude so they are never in the way, even when sitting. They are designed so that a can will fit into either one. The bottom side area supporting the underside of the can also has an oval hole for the rod butt, so a rod can also be put into either one. This oval hole allows the rod to be angled out to more easily watch the rod tip. Since the legs are angled outward from the main body, the legs also present a wide base to prevent tipping.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The tackle cool box opens to allow access to the compartments within. Storage is achieved by use of a lift out drawer, and also in the lid compartments. These lid compartments have a see-through snap over cover to keep all in place when the lid is rotated open, and in the closed position. The lift out drawer is also removable for cleaning and stocking with lures, away from the tackle cool box. Under the lift out drawer is insulation to further keep the cooler compartments warm or cold as desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In addition, the handle is designed for ease of carrying, and also stores behind the cooler. The handle is rotated completely out of the way when the fisherman is seated, and makes no contact with the fisherman. It also does not interfere with the cooler sliding out to either side, nor does it interfere with the complete opening of the tackle box to access the lures within. It is rotated forward for packaging the cooler in the shipping carton, and does not protrude past the lower footprint, minimizing carton size.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">A further benefit of the handle is that when it is in the vertical position to carry the tackle cool box, the bottom side extensions of the handle engage the centered cooler at the handles and prevent the cooler from sliding out in either direction. This makes it safe and secure to carry the box without fear of the cooler exiting and dumping the contents. The engagement is accomplished by the geometry of the handle. It is shaped to be an arc and requires the handle to flex it in to engage and disengage. The built in spring force of the handle keeps the handle in place, but can be flexed when the handle is physically rotated, allowing the handle to disengage and rotate to clear the cooler.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The following detailed description and appended drawings describe and illustrate various embodiments of the invention. The description and drawings serve to enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any manner. In respect of the methods disclosed, the steps presented are exemplary in nature, and thus, the order of the steps is not necessary or critical.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">
        <figref>FIGS. 1-8</figref> illustrate a tackle cool box <b>100</b> according to the present disclosure. As used herein, the term âtackle cool boxâ is defined as being combination tackle box for storing fishing tackle and cooler for storing items under cooled or heated conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The tackle cool box <b>100</b> has a tackle box main body <b>102</b>. The main body <b>102</b> is desirably formed from a weather-resistant material. For example, the main body <b>102</b> may be formed from a thermoplastic material by injection molding or other suitable process for molding a thermoplastic material. Other suitable materials for the main body <b>102</b> may also be selected by a skilled artisan within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The main body <b>102</b> has a top side <b>104</b>, a bottom side <b>106</b>, a first side <b>108</b>, and a second side <b>110</b>. The first side <b>108</b> has a first opening <b>112</b> formed therein. The second side <b>110</b> has a second opening <b>114</b> formed therein. The first opening <b>112</b> and the second opening <b>114</b> are connected and together define a passage through the main body <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The tackle cool box <b>100</b> also has a cooler <b>116</b>. The cooler <b>116</b> is insulated or otherwise formed from an thermally-insulative material. For example, the cooler <b>116</b> may have a closed cell polymer foam configured to militate against a transfer of heat to or from the contents of the cooler <b>116</b> when sealed. One of ordinary skill in the art may select suitable materials and constructions for the cooler <b>116</b>, as desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The cooler <b>116</b> is slidably attached to the bottom side <b>106</b> of the main body <b>102</b>. For example, the cooler <b>116</b> may have lips <b>118</b> disposed on opposing sides of the cooler <b>116</b> that are received by channels <b>120</b> disposed on the bottom side <b>106</b> of the main body <b>102</b>. The channels <b>120</b> may extend between the first side <b>110</b> and the second side <b>112</b> of the main body <b>102</b>. The channels <b>120</b> support the cooler <b>116</b> and permit it to be slid to and fro through the passage formed through the main body <b>102</b>. The cooler <b>116</b> may also be slid completely out of the main body <b>102</b> for cleaning, for example. The lips <b>118</b> may be integrally formed with the cooler <b>116</b>, or attached to the cooler <b>116</b> with a fastener, as desired. The channels <b>120</b> may be integrally formed with the main body <b>102</b>, or attached to the main body <b>102</b> with a fastener, as desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 5-8</figref>, the cooler <b>116</b> also has two chambers, including a first chamber <b>122</b> and a second chamber <b>124</b>. The first chamber <b>122</b> and the second chamber <b>124</b> are separated by a wall or partition of the cooler <b>116</b>. For example, the first chamber <b>122</b> may be configured to receive food or drinks, and the second chamber <b>124</b> may be configured to receive bait for fishing. Additional chambers or partitions for the chambers are also contemplated and may be used in the cooler <b>116</b> by one skilled in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The cooler <b>116</b> of the present disclosure is slidable relative to the main body <b>102</b> to each of a closed position, a first open position, and a second open position. In the closed position, shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the first chamber <b>122</b> and the second chamber <b>124</b> of the cooler <b>116</b> are both disposed between the first side <b>108</b> and the second side <b>110</b> of the main body <b>102</b>. The first chamber <b>122</b> and the second chamber <b>124</b> of the cooler <b>116</b> are both sealed by cooperation with the bottom side <b>106</b> of the main body <b>102</b>, to facilitate a maintaining of a temperature of the contents of the first chamber <b>122</b> and the second chamber <b>124</b> while the cooler <b>116</b> is in the closed position. In one example, the bottom side <b>106</b> of the main body <b>102</b> forms a substantially fluid tight seal with the cooler <b>116</b> where in the closed position.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In the first open position, shown in <figref>FIGS. 5-6</figref>, the cooler <b>116</b> is slid through the first opening <b>112</b> of the main body <b>102</b> so that the first chamber <b>122</b> is at least partly disposed at a location laterally outwardly from the first opening <b>112</b>. This permits access to the contents of the first chamber <b>122</b> of the cooler <b>116</b>. In the first open position, the second chamber <b>124</b> remains disposed between the first side <b>108</b> and the second side <b>110</b> of the main body <b>102</b>. Thus, the second chamber <b>124</b> remains sealed and the temperature of its contents is maintained while the cooler <b>116</b> is in the first open position.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In the second open position, shown in <figref>FIGS. 7-8</figref>, the cooler <b>116</b> is slid through the second opening <b>114</b> of the main body <b>102</b> so that the second chamber <b>124</b> is at least partly disposed at a location laterally outwardly from the second opening <b>114</b>. This permits access to the contents of the second chamber <b>124</b> of the cooler <b>116</b>. In the second open position, the first chamber <b>122</b> remains disposed between the first side <b>108</b> and the second side <b>110</b> of the main body <b>102</b>. Thus, the first chamber <b>122</b> remains sealed and the temperature of its contents is maintained while the cooler <b>116</b> is in the second open position.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The tackle cool box <b>100</b> of the present disclosure may further have a lid <b>126</b>. The lid <b>126</b> may be used to selectively seal a recess <b>128</b> formed in the top side <b>104</b> of the main body <b>102</b>, for example. Advantageously, in embodiments where the main body <b>102</b> has a robust construction configured to support the weight of a fisherman, an outer surface of the lid <b>126</b> may be substantially free of protrusions. In this manner, one is also permitted to comfortably sit on the outer surface of the lid <b>126</b>, and the tackle cool box <b>100</b> may be used as a bench or seat by the fisherman while fishing.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In a particular embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 5-8</figref>, the recess <b>128</b> also may contain a removable drawer <b>130</b>. The removable drawer <b>130</b> can have a plurality of first compartments configured to store fishing tackle. The first compartments can be of the same size, or of different sizes in order to accommodate differently sized fishing tackle including lures, hooks, weights, and other fishing accessories.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">As illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1-8</figref>, the lid <b>126</b> may be hingedly attached to the main body <b>102</b> of the tackle cool box <b>100</b>. The lid <b>126</b> is thereby rotatable between an open position and a closed position. In the closed position, shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-5</figref>, the recess <b>128</b> is sealed by the lid <b>126</b>, for example, when the fishing tackle is not in use or is otherwise being stored. In the open position, shown in <figref>FIGS. 5-8</figref>, the recess <b>128</b> can be accessed, for example, to remove the fishing tackle stored therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In a further embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 5-8</figref>, the lid <b>126</b> may also have a plurality of second compartments. The second compartments may be formed in an inner surface of the lid <b>126</b>, for example. Like the first compartments of the removable drawer <b>130</b>, the second compartments can be of the same size, or of different sizes in order to accommodate differently sized fishing tackle including lures, hooks, weights, and other fishing accessories.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Where the lid <b>126</b> has the second compartments, the tackle cool box <b>100</b> may be further provided with a cover <b>132</b>. The cover <b>132</b> is removably attached to the inner surface of the lid <b>126</b>. For example, the cover <b>132</b> can be hingedly attached to the main body <b>102</b>, and rotatable between an open position (shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>) and a closed position (shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>). The cover <b>132</b> may also securely but removably snap to the lid <b>126</b>, for example, with a fastener providing a friction- or interference-fit with the lid <b>126</b>, in order to selectively close or seal the second compartments. In one example, the cover <b>132</b> is transparent in order to allow one to view the contents of the second compartments without removing the cover <b>132</b>. One of ordinary skill in the art may select other suitable means for removably attaching the cover <b>132</b> to the lid <b>126</b>, for purposes of selectively closing the second compartments, as desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The tackle cool box <b>100</b> of the present disclosure may further have a handle <b>134</b>. The handle <b>134</b> is rotatably connected to the first side <b>108</b> and the second side <b>110</b> of the main body <b>102</b>. For example, the handle <b>134</b> has a first end <b>136</b> connected to the first side <b>108</b> of the main body <b>102</b>, and a second end <b>138</b> connected to the second side <b>110</b> of the main body <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The means for connecting the handle <b>134</b> may include a first pin <b>140</b> and a second pin <b>142</b>. The first pin <b>140</b> may be attached to one of the first end <b>136</b> of the handle <b>134</b> and the main body <b>102</b>, and is rotatably seated in a corresponding hole formed in the other of the first end <b>136</b> of the handle <b>134</b> and the main body <b>102</b>. The second pin <b>142</b> may be attached to one of the second end <b>138</b> of the handle <b>134</b> and the main body <b>102</b>, and is rotatably seated in a corresponding hole formed in the other of the second end <b>138</b> of the handle <b>134</b> and the main body <b>102</b>. It should be understood that other suitable means for rotatably connecting the handle <b>134</b> to the main body <b>102</b> may also be employed within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The handle <b>134</b> is rotatable between a substantially upright position, for example, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, to a stored position, for example, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 5-8</figref>. In the substantially upright position, the handle <b>134</b> may be spaced apart from the top side <b>104</b> of the main body <b>102</b> and configured for one to lift and transport the tackle cool box <b>100</b> from one location to another location. In the stored position, the handle <b>134</b> may be rotated to either a front or a rear of the main body <b>102</b>. For example, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 6 and 8</figref>, the handle <b>134</b> may be adjacent or abut the rear of the main body <b>102</b> where the handle <b>134</b> is rotated to the stored position.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Advantageously, a moving of the handle <b>134</b> to the stored position permits the lid <b>126</b> to be placed in the open position. In one embodiment, the first end <b>136</b> of the handle <b>134</b> has a first bottom side extension <b>144</b>, and the second end <b>138</b> of the handle <b>134</b> has a second bottom side extension <b>146</b>. The first bottom side extension <b>144</b> may extend away from the first pin <b>140</b> and corresponding hole, and the second bottom side extension <b>146</b> may extend away from the second pin <b>142</b> and corresponding hole. Where the handle <b>134</b> is rotated to the substantially upright position, the first bottom side extension <b>144</b> and the second bottom side extension <b>146</b> militate a lateral movement of the cooler <b>116</b> from the closed position. Where the handle <b>134</b> is rotated to the stored position, the first bottom side extension <b>144</b> and the second bottom side extension <b>146</b> are rotated to a position above the cooler <b>116</b> to allow the lateral movement of the cooler <b>116</b> from the closed position.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The handle <b>134</b> of the present disclosure may also be substantially arcuate in shape. The substantially arcuate shape of the handle <b>134</b> causes the ends <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> of the handle <b>134</b> to flex inwardly and engage the cooler <b>116</b> with the first bottom side extension <b>144</b> and the second bottom side extension <b>146</b> when the tackle cool box <b>100</b> is lifted by the handle <b>134</b>. This spring force is believed to further secure the cooler <b>116</b> within the main body <b>102</b> of the tackle cool box <b>100</b> when transported, for example, when the tackle cool box <b>100</b> is being moved to a fishing boat, dock, or shore for use in fishing.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The main body <b>102</b> of tackle cool box <b>100</b> may further have a plurality of legs <b>148</b>. The legs <b>148</b> are configured to support the main body <b>102</b> on a surface. In certain embodiments, the legs <b>148</b> may be integrally formed with the main body <b>102</b>, for example, by the injection molding process. In other embodiments, the legs <b>148</b> may be separately formed and subsequently affixed to the main body <b>102</b> with fasteners such as screws, bolts, rivets, or chemical adhesives, as nonlimiting examples.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The legs <b>148</b> may be formed from a material and have a construction sufficient to support the weight of an adult fisherman, in order to permit the tackle cool box <b>100</b> to also function as a bench or seat. One skilled in the art may select suitable materials and constructions for the legs <b>148</b> of the main body <b>102</b>, as desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">As illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1-2</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>7</b>, at least one of the legs <b>148</b> has a beverage receptacle <b>150</b>. The beverage receptacle <b>150</b> may be formed in the leg <b>148</b>, or separated formed and attached to the leg <b>148</b> with a fastener, as desired. The beverage receptacle <b>150</b> is configured to receive one of a can, a bottle, and a cup.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">In a particular embodiment, a hole <b>152</b> is also formed in a base of the beverage receptacle <b>150</b>.
