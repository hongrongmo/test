      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a novel block copolymer, a micelle preparation using the same, and an anticancer agent containing the micelle preparation as an active ingredient.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Many of drugs, particularly anticancer agents, are sparingly water-soluble hydrophobic compounds. When such drug is used to attain a desired therapeutic effect, the drug is usually solubilized and administered to a patient. Accordingly, solubilization of sparingly water-soluble drugs, particularly sparingly water-soluble anticancer agents, is important for oral or parenteral pharmaceutical preparations, particularly those for intravenous administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">As one method of solubilizing a sparingly water-soluble anticancer agent, there is a method which comprises adding a surfactant, and it is known to use, for example, a polyoxyethylene castor oil derivative (Cremophor) in order to solubilize paclitaxel. As an another method, a method of using a micelle-forming block copolymer as a drug carrier is described in, for example, JP-A-6-107565 (Patent Document 1), JP-A-6-206815 (Patent Document 2) or JP-A-11-335267 (Patent Document 3), and paclitaxel-encapsulated micelles are described in JP-A-2001-226294 (Patent Document 4).</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In the above-described method of solubilization with a surfactant, there is a problem that harmful side effects such as hypersensitive reaction attributable to the surfactant are observed in some cases and the stability of a pharmaceutical preparation is reduced so that when a drug-containing solution is stored or left, the drug is precipitated to make its administration difficult.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">A pharmaceutical preparation comprising a sparingly water-soluble anticancer agent such as a taxane anticancer agent with a block copolymer as a drug carrier, when intravenously administered, has never achieved retention of a higher concentration of the drug in blood, accumulation of the drug at a higher concentration in a tumor tissue, a higher pharmacological effect and lower side effects than when the drug is administered alone.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Accordingly, there is need for a medicinal preparation which has no harmful side effects such as hypersensitive reaction, increases the water solubility of a sparingly water-soluble anticancer agent, maintains a high drug concentration in blood, accumulates a drug at a high concentration in a tumor tissue, enhances the pharmacological effect of the sparingly water-soluble anticancer agent, and reduces the side effects of the anticancer agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The present inventors made extensive study to solve the problem described above, and as a result, they found a novel block copolymer, a micelle preparation using the copolymer, and an anticancer agent comprising the same as an active ingredient, and the present invention was thereby completed.</p>

      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0010">The novel block copolymer of the present invention can be a drug carrier of less toxicity without showing harmful side effects such as hypersensitive reaction. The block copolymer can form micelles in an aqueous medium and incorporate a sparingly water-soluble anticancer agent, especially paclitaxel, into the micelles in an amount necessary for disease treatment without bonding it to the block copolymer, thereby increasing the water solubility of the drug. When an aqueous solution of the micelle preparation of the present invention having the drug incorporated into it with the block copolymer is left at room temperature, the micelle preparation containing the sparingly water-soluble anticancer agent is stable in an aqueous medium without observing aggregation of the micelles or release of the drug from the micelles for at least several hours. The micelle preparation can be clinically useful anticancer agent because it maintains a higher concentration in blood and exhibit more potent drug activity with reduced side effects than by administering the anticancer agent alone or by administering the anticancer agent solubilized with a conventional surfactant.</p>

This reaction liquid was added dropwise to a mixed solvent (1.2 L) consisting of diisopropyl ether:ethanol (4:1), and precipitates were recovered by filtration and dried under reduced pressure to give 3.17 g of crude crystals. The crude crystals were dissolved in 30% aqueous acetonitrile solution and then passed through cation-exchange resin Dowex 50w8 (40 mL) and washed with the 30% aqueous acetonitrile.

      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0113">As shown in Table 1, the percentage of ester linkages of the block copolymers 2, 5 and 7 is lower than in the block copolymers 1, 4 and 6, and in measurement by anion exchange HPLC, these copolymers were not retained on the column. The block copolymer 3 (Comparative Example 1), on the other hand, showed a peak retained on the column in measurement by anion exchange HPLC. No retention of the block copolymers 2, 5 and 7 in anion exchange HPLC indicates that these block copolymers are substantially free of a carboxylic acid structure. The result in NMR measurement indicates that the percentage of the partial structure âN(i-Pr)âCOâNH(i-Pr) in the block copolymers 2, 5 and 7 is higher than in the block copolymers 1, 4 and 6, and the percentage of the partial structure âN(i-Pr)âCOâNH(i-Pr) in the block copolymer 2 in Example 1 is higher by 7% than in Comparative Example 1.</p>

      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0117">Mouse colon cancer Colon 26 cells were transplanted subcutaneously in the back of female CDF1 mouse, and after the volume of the tumor reached about 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, the micelle preparation of Example 4, or paclitaxel alone as the control drug, was administered via a mouse caudal vein into the mouse 3 times at 4-day intervals, to examine the effect thereof on advanced cancer. The micelle preparation had been diluted with 5% glucose solution to form a solution containing paclitaxel at a concentration of 3 mg/mL. Paclitaxel for use as the sole regimen was dissolved in ethanol and mixed with an equal volume of Cremophor (manufactured by Sigma) to prepare a solution containing paclitaxel at a concentration of 30 mg/mL, and the resulting preparation was diluted with physiological saline to 3 mg/mL just before administration. The antitumor effect of each drug was judged in percentage (T/C %) of the average tumor volume of the group which was given the drug on Day 11 after administration, relative to the average tumor volume of the group which was not given the drug. A lower numerical value is indicative of higher effect. The results are shown in Table 3.</p>

      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0119">Each drug was prepared according to the same method as in Test Example 2 (in vivo antitumor effect on Colon 26). A micelle preparation containing paclitaxel, or paclitaxel alone, each at a dose level of 50 mg/kg, was administered via a mouse caudal vein into female CDF1 mouse transplanted with mouse colon cancer Colon 26 in the back, and after a predetermined time, whole blood was collected through an armpit artery. 0.01 mL of plasma obtained by centrifugation was deproteinized (3 times) with 0.2 mL of water and 1 mL of acetonitrile and then subjected to liquid/liquid extraction by adding 2 mL of t-butyl methyl ether. The organic layer was recovered, evaporated into dryness, dissolved in 0.4 mL of dissolving liquid for HPLC, and measured for its paclitaxel concentration by HPLC. Separately, the tumor was homogenized with 0.5% acetic acid to prepare 1% tumor homogenate, and 0.1 mL of 1% tumor homogenate was deproteinized (3 times) with 0.1 mL of water and 1 mL of acetonitrile and subjected to liquid/liquid extraction by adding 2 mL of t-butyl methyl ether. The organic layer was concentrated and dissolved in 0.4 mL of dissolving liquid for HPLC and measured for its paclitaxel concentration by HPLC. The results are shown in Tables 4 and 5.</p>
