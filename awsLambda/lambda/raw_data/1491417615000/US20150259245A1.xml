      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The invention relates to a substrate, a touch panel, and a processing method of the substrate. More particularly, the invention relates to a rigid substrate, a touch panel including the rigid substrate, and a processing method of the rigid substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">As probabilities for users to be in direct contact with panel devices significantly increase, possibilities of damaging the panel devices due to lack of mechanical strength may also increase. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the panel devices has become an important factor in indicating a durability of electronic products. Currently, a strengthened substrate (e.g., a strengthened glass plate or the industrial so-called cover plate) has already been utilized to manufacture the panel device so as to enhance the mechanical strength thereof. Namely, electronic devices with touch or display functionalities may be manufactured on the strengthened substrate so as to enhance the overall mechanical strength of the panel devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Nevertheless, the strengthened substrate generally has to undergo a process of cutting and forming so as to comply with a designed size of a product, a plurality of cracks with different sizes are produced at cut-off edges during the process of cutting and forming, and the cracks with different sizes often become stress concentration areas. Therefore, the aforementioned substrate still has some limits as in enhancing the mechanical strength of the panel devices; and especially, the substrate often starts to crack from the cut-off edges.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The invention provides a rigid substrate having an etched wall with uniformed cracks, and thus is capable of providing an ideal mechanical strength.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The invention provides a touch panel utilizing a rigid substrate with ideal mechanical strength to provide bearing function, and thus has favorable quality and durability.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The invention provides a processing method of a rigid substrate capable of effectively avoiding the stress concentration phenomenon on the wall of the rigid substrate after cutting.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The invention provides a rigid substrate including an ion strengthened surface layer completely covering the entire outer surface of the rigid substrate. The rigid substrate has an etched wall, wherein an average depth of the ion strengthened surface layer on the etched wall is substantially equivalent to an average depth of the ion strengthened surface layer outside of the etched wall.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The invention further provides a touch panel including a rigid substrate and a touch device. The rigid substrate includes an ion strengthened surface layer completely covering the entire outer surface of the rigid substrate. The rigid substrate has an etched wall, wherein an average depth of the ion strengthened surface layer on the etched wall is substantially equivalent to an average depth of the ion strengthened surface layer outside of the etched wall. The touch device is disposed on the rigid substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">According to an embodiment, an average surface roughness of the etched wall ranges from 0.03 Î¼m to 0.8 Î¼m.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">According to an embodiment, the etched wall includes a plurality of cracks, and aperture sizes of the cracks range from 3 Î¼m to 15 Î¼m.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">According to an embodiment, the etched wall includes a plurality of cracks, and the average depth of the ion strengthened surface layer is substantially greater than an average depth of the cracks.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">According to an embodiment, the touch panel further includes a decoration pattern layer disposed on the rigid substrate, and the decoration pattern layer is substantially located at the periphery of the touch device.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The invention further provides a processing method of a rigid substrate. A mechanical or a material removal processing is performed on a rigid motherboard to form a rigid substrate parison, so that the rigid substrate parison has a cutting wall. An etching process is performed to the cutting wall so that the cutting wall becomes an etched wall. An ion strengthening process is performed to the rigid substrate parison so that the entire outer surface of the rigid substrate completely including an ion strengthened surface layer is formed, wherein an average depth of the ion strengthened surface layer on the etched wall is substantially equivalent to an average depth of the ion strengthened surface layer outside of the etched wall.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">According to an embodiment, the steps of performing the etching process on the cutting wall includes attaching a resistant layer onto the rigid substrate and enabling the resistant layer to expose a part of the cutting wall; and contacting the exposed part of the etched wall with an etchant. Specifically, a material of the rigid substrate is glass, and a material of the etchant is hydrofluoric acid. Moreover, the resistant layer is removed, for example, before the ion strengthening process is performed.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">According to an embodiment, an average surface roughness of the cutting wall ranges from 1.0 Î¼m to 3 Î¼m, and an average surface roughness of the etched wall ranges from 0.03 Î¼m to 0.8 Î¼m.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">According to an embodiment, the step of performing the ion strengthening process includes wholly contacting the rigid substrate with an ion strengthening liquid.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">According to an embodiment, the mechanical or the material removal processing includes at least one of cutting, grinding, hole boring, chamfering, patterned etching, and polishing process.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">According to an embodiment, the etching process is performed with a dry etching medium or a wet etching medium, wherein the dry etching medium includes a fluorine-containing gas or a plasma, and the wet etching medium includes at least a hydrofluoric acid or a fluorine-containing solvent.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">According to the foregoing, the invention provides a processing method to perform etching on the cutting wall of the rigid substrate which has been subjected to the mechanical or material removal processing, so as to form the etched wall. The sizes of the cracks on the etched wall are greater than the cutting wall before the etching, and the average surface roughness of the etched wall is smaller than the cutting wall before the etching. Therefore, the etched wall, relative to the cutting wall, is less likely to produce a stress concentration phenomenon at specific areas. Consequently, the ion strengthened etched wall may effectively enhance the mechanical strength of the rigid substrate, and thus enables the touch panel including the rigid substrate to have an ideal quality and durability.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Furthermore, because the qualities of the preceding mechanical or material removal processing are varied, the resulting depths of the cracks are inconsistent, and thus an achievable effect after being ion strengthened is influenced. However, in the embodiments, a chemical strengthening process is performed after the mechanical processed rigid substrate parison is being etched, so that the cracks may be substantially covering by the ion strengthened surface layer. Herein, a corresponding compressive stress distribution layer may be derived from the ion strengthened surface layer, and a compressive stress distribution layer may restrain the enlargement of the cracks on the glass surface so as to enhance the strength of the glass undergoing damage, and thus enables a much stable product strength.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Apart from the above, viewing from another perspective, since the depths of the cracks have been uniformed by etching in advance; therefore, the ion strengthened surface layer are able to cover the cracks without requiring a stringent process condition of the subsequent overall chemical strengthening, for example: a processing time may be relatively short, or so forth.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In order to make the aforementioned and other features and advantages of the invention comprehensible, several exemplary embodiments accompanied with figures are described in detail below.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">It is noted that a depth of an ion strengthened surface layer of a glass in embodiment of the invention is referring to an average depth of potassium ions diffusing from the outer surface into the interior of the glass, and a better definition is referring to an average value of maximum diffusion depths of the potassium ion when a plurality of areas are divided out on the entire outer surface of the glass. The depth of the ion strengthened surface layer generally may be obtained by utilizing an instrument to detect whether the potassium ions are present. Since even under a same manufacturing process the diffusion depths of the ions would still vary, the invention adopts the average value of the diffusion depths as a standard for determining the depth of the ion strengthened surface layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Namely, in an embodiment, the depth of the ion strengthened surface layer may be defined as a value obtained from averaging the corresponding measured depths of a plurality of measuring points on the outer surface of the glass, wherein the concentrations of the potassium ions (K+) is measure from the outer surface towards the interior of the glass at the measuring points to obtain the corresponding measured depths. Generally, potassium ion distribution is highest on the outer surface of a substrate, and then gradually decreasing to zero or to a background value as towards the interior. Thus, the measured depth of each measuring point is substantially a distance from the outer surface of the glass to a location where the potassium ion concentration is gradually decreased to zero or the background value, wherein the background value is referring to an ion concentration of a raw material when the glass is manufactured.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">For example, when the potassium ions are initially presented in the raw material of the glass, the potassium ion concentration of the raw material may be defined as the background value. In other words, since the ion strengthened surface layer is defined by the depths of exchanged ions (e.g., potassium ions) entering into the glass through an exchange/a diffusion mechanism, a concentration distribution of the exchanged ions would gradually decrease from the outer surface of a glass substrate towards to zero or the background value; and therefore, the presence of the ion strengthened surface layer may be determined through utilizing the instrument to detect the concentration of the exchanged ions. Moreover, the average depth may be the average value of the depths of the ion strengthened surface layer at a plurality of measuring points. Favourably, the average depth is defined by the average value of maximum diffusion depths of the exchanged ions in each measuring area within the glass.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In practical, ion strengthened surface layers with slightly different depths may be formed by a same ion strengthening process, and thus the average value of the depths of the ion strengthened surface layers may be obtained through detecting the diffusion depths of the exchanged ions at several different locations. For example, five different location points on the strengthened glass substrate are chosen, the diffusion depths of potassium ions are detected by the instrument, the five measured values are averaged to obtain an average value, and this average value represents an average depth T or d of the entire outer surface of the ion strengthened surface layer. Moreover, the ion exchange behavior of exchanging the potassium ions with the sodium ions is only an example for illustration purpose, the invention is not limited thereto, and other ion exchange behavior capable of producing a strength enhancement effect may also be applied to every embodiment of the invention. Furthermore, a material of the glass is not particularly limited, such that the material may include, for example, sodium-calcium-silicate glass and aluminosilicate glass.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> to <figref>FIG. 4</figref> schematically illustrate a process flow of a processing method of a rigid substrate according an embodiment. Referring to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, a rigid motherboard <b>10</b> is provided. Specifically, a material of the rigid motherboard <b>10</b> is glass, such as a soda-lime glass, a boro-silicate glass, an alumo-silicate glass, and so forth. Nevertheless, the material of the rigid motherboard <b>10</b> is not particularly limited to the ones mentioned above; other glass plate material capable of being utilized as a bearing in a panel device may be processed with the following disclosed processing method.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Next, a mechanical or a material removal processing is performed to pattern the rigid motherboard <b>10</b> in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> into at least one rigid substrate parison <b>100</b> with a desired appearance, as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. In an embodiment, the rigid motherboard <b>10</b> may be cut into at least one rigid substrate parisons <b>100</b>. Namely, the number of the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b> cut-off from the rigid motherboard <b>10</b> during the mechanical or a material removal processing such as the cutting process is not particularly limited herein. Thus, <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates only one rigid substrate parison <b>100</b> for the purpose of simplifying the description.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Moreover, the mechanical or the material removal processing may include at least one step of a cutting step, a grinding step, a hole boring step, a chamfering step, a patterned etching step, and a polishing step. Therefore, the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b> after cut-off, in addition to having a desired size, may also have a grinded rounding R, so that when the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b> is applied in a product, the aesthetic appearance of the product may be enhanced, and users are protected from being scratched by a sharp corner of the product. In addition, the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b> after cut-off, according to the design requirement, may be further formed with a through hole TH through the hole boring step, and the through hole TH may be utilized as an earphone hole, a microphone hole or a decorative hole in an electronic product.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Certainly, the aforementioned structure is an exemplary illustration, and the invention is not limited thereto. In other embodiment, the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b> may selectively has a sharp turning corner. Evermore, in another embodiment, as a cross-sectional diagram of a mechanical or material removal processed rigid substrate parison schematically illustrated in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, a rigid substrate parison <b>100</b>â² may have an arc-shaped cutting wall <b>100</b>Aâ². Now, the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b>â² has a substantially planar upper surface <b>100</b>W, a substantially planar bottom surface <b>100</b>Câ², wherein the arc-shaped cutting wall <b>100</b>Aâ² is connected between the upper surface <b>100</b>Bâ² and the lower surface <b>100</b>Câ². Certainly, the aforementioned design is only an example used for the purpose of illustration, in other embodiments, the upper surface <b>100</b>Bâ² may also have an arc-shaped appearance.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Noteworthy, in the process of mechanical or material removal processing, such as the cutting step, the grinding step, the hole boring step, the chamfering step, the patterned etching step, and the polishing step, the cutting wall <b>100</b>A of the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b> is repeatedly under impact (impact of cutting tools, impact of grinding particles, erosion of an etchant or impact of polishing particles). Hence, the cutting wall <b>100</b>A substantially has a plurality of cracks with different sizes and poor regularities. The cracks extend from the impacted outer surface towards the interior, and often result in stress concentration areas during the subsequent manufacturing process or using process. Specifically, the poorer the regularity of the cracks, the easier for the stress to be concentrated in certain particular area. Consequently, the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b> after cut-off even though has the required appearance, but still has no ideal mechanical strength.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Therefore, the present embodiment provides a method to further performs other processing procedures on the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b>. For example, referring to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the processing method of the present embodiment further includes to attaches a resist film <b>20</b> on the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b>, and enables the resist film <b>20</b> to expose the cutting wall <b>100</b>A and a portion adjacent to the cutting wall <b>100</b>A. Herein, since the through hole TH is manufactured through the mechanical or material removal processing, a wall that defines the through hole TH can also have the property similar to the cutting wall <b>100</b>A and the resist film <b>20</b> can be further designed with an opening <b>20</b>A for exposing the through hole TH. Next, an etching process is performed to the cutting wall <b>110</b>A exposed by the resist film <b>20</b> and the wall that defines the through hole TH.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In an embodiment, the etching process may include contacting the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b> with a dry etching medium or a wet etching medium, wherein the dry etching medium includes a fluorine-containing gas or a plasma, and the wet etching medium includes at least a hydrofluoric acid or a fluorine-containing solvent. Herein, the material of the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b> is glass, so that the etching medium of the choice may be the hydrofluoric acid or other material capable of eroding the glass.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Under the etching process, partial outer surface of the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b> in contact with the etching medium such as the cutting wall <b>100</b>A is eroded, and thus the cracks thereon can be altered. For example, the cracks with both inhomogeneous distribution and sizes on the cutting wall <b>100</b>A may be changed into a state of having more homogeneous distribution and sizes by the effect of etching medium. Therefore, the resist film <b>20</b> is removed after the etching process, and then a rigid substrate <b>102</b> with desirable mechanical strength, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, may be obtained by performing an ion strengthening process to the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b>. The ion strengthening process, herein, may be an ion strengthening process already been utilized in the application of strengthening glass plate, such as wholly contacting the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b>, which is not attached with other film layer, with an ion strengthening solution. Namely, the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b>, which is not attached with other film layer, is wholly soaked in the ion strengthening solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Referring to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the rigid substrate <b>102</b> has an etched wall <b>102</b>A; furthermore, although it is not particularly illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the entire outer surface of the rigid substrate <b>102</b> is sustainably completely covered with the ion strengthened surface layer. In addition, an average depth of the ion strengthened surface layer on the etched wall <b>102</b>A is substantially equivalent to an average depth of the ion strengthened surface layer outside of the etched wall <b>102</b>A. In an embodiment, the etched wall <b>102</b>A may include a plurality of cracks (as shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>), and the average depth of the ion strengthened surface layer is substantially greater than an average depth of the cracks. The definition and the measurement method of depths of the ion strengthened surface layer are provided in the above descriptions, and thus are not repeated herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Differences between the etched wall <b>102</b>A and the cutting wall <b>100</b>A in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> include: an average surface roughness of the cutting wall <b>100</b> ranges from 1.0 Î¼m to 3.0 Î¼m, while an average surface roughness of the etched wall <b>102</b>A ranges from 0.03 Î¼m to 0.8 Î¼m. Moreover, <figref>FIG. 5</figref> and <figref>FIG. 6</figref> are respectively sample states of a cutting wall <b>100</b>B and an etched wall <b>102</b>B under a microscope with 50 times magnification. By referring to both <figref>FIG. 5</figref> and <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, it is able to know that the surface homogeneity of the cutting wall <b>100</b>A is relatively poor (inhomogeneous cracks distribution) while the surface homogeneity of etched wall <b>102</b>A is relatively better (more homogeneous cracks distribution). In addition, as shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the etched wall <b>102</b>A includes a plurality of cracks B, and aperture sizes of the cracks B range from 3 Î¼m to 15 Î¼m. According to the structure described above, the rigid substrate <b>102</b> with the etched wall <b>102</b>A, in relative to the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b> with the cutting wall <b>100</b>A, is less likely to occur a stress concentration phenomenon.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">For example, <figref>FIG. 7</figref> schematically illustrates a sectional structure of a cutting wall <b>100</b>A and an etched wall <b>102</b>A of the rigid substrate. Referring to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, in the process of mechanical or material removal processing, the outer surface of the cutting wall <b>100</b>A is directly under the impact of the cutting tools, the grinding particles and so forth; and therefore, many cracks with different sizes are presented in the cross-sectional structure of the cutting wall <b>100</b>A. However, under the effect of etchant, the outer surface of the etched wall <b>102</b>A, in relative to the outer surface of the cutting wall <b>100</b>A, is relatively indented. Therefore, in addition to a reduction in a depth d<b>2</b> of the cracks (in relative to a depth d<b>1</b> of the cracks), a tip T of an originally sharp crack may further be altered to be relatively smooth (e.g., a tip O of the cracks), and an original size W<b>1</b> of the cracks is also correspondingly enlarged (e.g., an size W<b>2</b> of the cracks).</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">According to Griffith's theory, the greater (the smoother) the radius curvatures of the tips T, O of the cracks, the smaller the stress concentration effect. Therefore, the present embodiment provides a method to perform an etching process after the cutting process so as to transfer the cutting wall <b>100</b>A with relatively poor homogeneity into the etched wall <b>102</b>A with relatively better homogeneity, and thus is helpful in reducing a probability of damaging the rigid substrate <b>102</b> due to occurrences of the stress concentration. Moreover, the processing method of the present embodiment further includes performing the ion strengthening process after the etched wall <b>102</b>A is formed, and thus may further enhance the mechanical strength of the rigid substrate <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In overall, it does not matter whether the process conditions of cutting process are subjected to a strict control in order to prevent the generation of cracks, contacting the etchant with the cutting wall <b>100</b>A after the cutting process still facilitates in reducing the original depths of the cracks on the cutting wall <b>100</b>A, so that the cracks become more flat and the etched wall <b>102</b>A with relatively higher homogeneity can be formed. Consequently, the processed rigid substrate <b>102</b> in respective to the mechanical strength may be superior to the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b>. Therefore, in the aforementioned processing steps, in addition to the ion strengthening process, etching effect of the etchant may also enables the strength of the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b> after cut-off to be further strengthened, and thus facilitates in the enhancement of a production yield of the rigid substrate <b>102</b>. For example, when measuring the mechanical strength of the rigid substrate <b>102</b> with a destructive test, a passing rate of the rigid substrate <b>102</b> may be relatively higher than the rigid substrate parison <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">
        <figref>FIG. 8</figref> schematically illustrates a touch panel according to an embodiment. Referring <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, in the present embodiment, a touch device <b>210</b> can be directly fabricated on the rigid substrate <b>102</b> processed with the aforementioned steps so as to constitute a touch panel <b>200</b>. Moreover, a decoration pattern layer <b>220</b> may also be disposed on the rigid substrate <b>102</b>, and the decoration pattern layer <b>220</b> may be located at the periphery of the touch device <b>210</b>. In practice, the touch device <b>210</b> may extend to climb the decoration pattern layer <b>220</b>. The decoration pattern layer <b>220</b> may be, as shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, selectively located at a side of the rigid substrate <b>102</b> where the touch device <b>210</b> is. However, in other embodiments, the touch device <b>210</b> and the decoration pattern layer <b>220</b> may be separately located at two opposite sides of the rigid substrate <b>102</b>. A material of the decoration pattern layer <b>220</b> may be ink, diamond-like carbon, ceramic material, or so forth.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In the steps illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the rigid substrate <b>102</b> has been cut into the desired size and shape. Therefore, the manufacturing method of the touch panel <b>200</b> may include forming the touch device <b>210</b> directly on the rigid substrate <b>102</b>. In addition, no further cutting is necessary after the manufacture of the touch device <b>210</b>, and thus is helpful for avoiding a reduction in the mechanical strength of the touch panel <b>200</b> due to the additional segmentation step. Moreover, in order to mass produce needs or in order to reduce equipment costs, multiple rigid substrates <b>102</b> may further be selectively attached onto an auxiliary carrier board (not shown), and then simultaneously manufacture the corresponding touch devices <b>210</b> on the rigid substrates <b>102</b> through utilizing a bearing of the auxiliary carrier board. Accordingly, multiple touch panels <b>200</b> may be manufactured in a single manufacturing process.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Since the rigid substrate <b>102</b> has the ideal mechanical strength, the touch panel <b>200</b> is able to have a favorable quality without having an additional protective cover. Therefore, the touch panel <b>200</b> may be utilizes as an outmost component of an electronic device without requiring a protection from other component.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">In addition, the touch device <b>210</b> may be constituted of a single sensing electrode layer or a plurality of sensing electrode layers, and the touch device <b>210</b> may be realized with multiple designs. For example, the touch device <b>210</b> may be constituted of a plurality of first sensing serials S<b>1</b> and a plurality of second sensing serials S<b>2</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>; or, the touch device <b>210</b> may be constituted of a plurality of strip-shaped electrodes S<b>3</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, wherein a width of each strip-shaped electrode S<b>3</b> gradually decreases from one end to another end. Certainly, the touch device <b>210</b> may also be constituted of a plurality of rectangular electrodes S<b>4</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>. All types of design of the touch device <b>210</b> mentioned above are only provided as examples for the illustration purpose, and the embodiments of the touch device <b>210</b> are not limited thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In summary, the wall (viz., cutting wall) of the rigid substrate after cut-off is etched with the etchant according to the embodiments. Therefore, the rigid substrate has the etched wall, wherein the etched wall, relative to the cutting wall, has better homogeneity. Therefore, the ion strengthened etched wall is less likely to produce the stress concentration phenomenon, and is helpful in enhancing the mechanical strength of the rigid substrate, such as an anti-bending strength. Because qualities of different mechanical or material removal processes may have differences, the resulting depths of the cracks are inconsistent, and thus an achievable effect after being ion strengthened is influenced. However, in the embodiments, a chemical (ion) strengthening is performed after the mechanical or material removal processed rigid substrate is being partially etched, so that the cracks may be ensured to be substantially covering by the ion strengthened surface layer. Herein, a corresponding compressive stress distribution layer may be derived from the ion strengthened surface layer, and a compressive stress distribution layer may limit the crack growths on the glass surface so as to enhance the strength of the glass substrate undergoing damage, and thus enables a much stable product strength.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Consequently, the touch panel manufactured with the aforementioned rigid substrate may have ideal mechanical strength, and favorable quality.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the structure of the invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. In view of the foregoing, it is intended that the invention cover modifications and variations of this invention provided they fall within the scope of the following claims and their equivalents.</p>
