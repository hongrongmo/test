      <u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The rapid increase in the incidence of gram-positive infections-including those caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria-has sparked renewed interest in the development of novel classes of antibiotics. One such class is the lipopeptide antibiotics, which includes daptomycin. Daptomycin has potent bactericidal activity <i>in vitro</i> against clinically relevant gram-positive bacteria that cause serious and life-threatening diseases. These bacteria include resistant pathogens, such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), glycopeptide intermediary susceptible <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (GISA), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), and penicillin-resistant <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (PRSP), for which there are very few therapeutic alternatives. See, <i>e.g</i>., <nplcit id="ncit-00001" npl-type="s"><text>Tally et al., 1999, Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs 8:1223-1238</text></nplcit>, hereafter "Tally". Daptomycin's inhibitory effect is a rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal effect <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo,</i> and a relatively prolonged concentration-dependent post-antibiotic effect <i>in vivo.</i></p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Daptomycin is described by <nplcit id="ncit-00002" npl-type="b"><text>Baltz in Biotechnology of Antibiotics, 2nd Ed., ed. W.R. Strohl (New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc.), 1997, pp. 415-435</text></nplcit>, hereafter "Baltz." Daptomycin, also known as LY 146032, is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic that can be derived from the fermentation of <i>Streptomyces roseosporus</i>. Daptomycin, is a member of the factor A-21978C<sub>0</sub> type antibiotics of <i>S</i>. <i>roseosporus</i> and is comprised of a decanoyl side chain linked to the N-terminal tryptophan of a cyclic 13-amino acid peptide (<figref>Fig. 1</figref>). Daptomycin has an excellent profile of activity because it is highly effective against most gram-positive bacteria; it is highly bactericidal and fast-acting; it has a low resistance rate and is effective against antibiotic-resistant organisms. The compound is currently being developed in a variety of formulations to treat serious infections caused by bacteria, including, but not limited to, methicillin resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE).</p>

After elution, the semipurified daptomycin was passed through a column containing HP-20ss, and then separated again on HP-20 resin. The '843 patent states that final resolution and separation of daptomycin from structurally similar compounds by this method is impeded by the presence of impurities that are not identifiable by ultraviolet analysis of the fermentation broth.

The '843 patent also discloses a "reverse method" for purification comprising the steps of contacting an aqueous solution of the fermentation product with a non-functional resin in aqueous phase, physically removing the water from the charged resin, rewetting the charged resin with a polar organic solvent, washing the resin with the organic solvent, eluting the fermentation product from the resin by increasing the polarity of the solvent and recovering the fermentation product. The '843 patent teaches that this method improves the final purity from about 80% to about 93% and increases the yield from about 5% to about 35%; however, the '843 patent does not disclose the type of impurities present in the daptomycin preparation.</p>

The '226 patent teaches that the presence of this intermediate, designated anhydro-daptomycin, is more pronounced at pH 4-6.

(Pharmaceutical Research, 6:387-393, 1989</text></nplcit>, hereafter "Kirsch") stated that anhydro-daptomycin and the Î²-isomer were produced in the purification of daptomycin. Kirsch described methods to minimize the levels of anhydro-daptomycin and the Î²-isomer through manipulation of pH conditions and temperature conditions. However, Kirsch was unable to stabilize daptomycin and prevent the conversion of daptomycin to anhydro-daptomycin and its subsequent isomerization to Î²-isomer. Kirsch was also unable to prevent the degradation of daptomycin into other degradation products unrelated to anhydro-daptomycin and Î²-isomer.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The '226 patent states that daptomycin may be prepared using these procedures so that the daptomycin contains no more than 2.5% by weight of a combined total of anhydro-daptomycin and Î²-isomer, but gives no indication of the levels of other impurities. In the method taught in United States Patent <patcit id="pcit-00023" dnum="US4874843A"><text>4,874,843</text></patcit> and in large-scale preparations of daptomycin for clinical trials, the highest daptomycin purity levels observed has been about 90%-93%. There is a need for a commercially feasible method to produce more highly purified daptomycin and, if possible, to increase its yield after purification. Furthermore, it would be desirable to obtain purified daptomycin that contains little or none of anhydro-daptomycin and the Î²-isomer form of daptomycin. It would also be desirable to reduce the levels of a number of other impurities in daptomycin. However, there has been no method available in the art that has been shown to be able to further reduce the levels of anhydro-daptomycin, Î²-isomer form and other impurities in the daptomycin product.</p>

      <u>Objects of the Invention</u>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">One object of the present invention is to provide a method for purifying lipopeptides that is easily scaled for commercial production comprising a unique combination of anion exchange chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. In a preferred embodiment, the method is used to manufacture purified daptomycin that is greater than 95% pure and exhibits reduced levels of impurities compared to daptomycin prepared by prior art methods. In another preferred embodiment, the method is used to manufacture daptomycin using reduced levels of solvents compared to those used in prior art methods. In another preferred embodiment, the method is used to manufacture purified daptomycin-related lipopeptides that are greater than 95% pure.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for increasing the levels of a lipopeptide produced by a microorganism by feeding the fermentation culture a reduced level of a fatty acid.

In a preferred embodiment, the method is used to increase the concentration and amount of daptomycin produced by <i>Streptomyces roseosporus</i> while minimizing the production of related contaminants. Lower levels of contaminants in the fermentation broth results in a more efficient recovery and purification of daptomycin, which provides for a manufacturing process with a higher yield.</p>

In a preferred embodiment, the method comprises subjecting the lipopeptides to conditions in which micelles are formed, separating the lipopeptide micelles from low molecular weight contaminants by, e.g., a size separation technique. In another preferred embodiment, the method comprises subjecting the lipopeptides to conditions in which the lipopeptides are in monomeric form and separating the monomeric lipopeptide molecules from high molecular weight molecules or aggregates by, e.g., a size separation technique. In a more preferred embodiment, the method comprises both steps: subjecting the lipopeptides to conditions in which micelles are formed and separating the lipopeptide micelles from low molecular weight contaminants, and then subjecting the lipopeptide micelles to conditions in which the lipopeptides are in monomeric form and separating the lipopeptide monomers from high molecular weight molecules or aggregates. These two steps may be performed in either order. In an even more preferred embodiment, the size separation technique is ultrafiltration or size exclusion chromatography.</p>

      <u>Methods for Manufacturing Purified Lipopeptides</u>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">One embodiment of the present invention is drawn to a process chromatography method that produces a purified lipopeptide in a commercially feasible manner. In a preferred embodiment, the lipopeptide is daptomycin or a daptomycin-related lipopeptide. The process chromatography method comprises sequentially using anion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and anion exchange chromatography to purify a preparation containing a lipopeptide, such as daptomycin or a daptomycin-related lipopeptide.</p>
    <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In a preferred embodiment of the instant invention, the purification method further comprises altering the fermentation conditions in which the A21978C-containing crude product is produced by <i>Streptomyces roseosporus</i> in order to increase daptomycin production and decrease impurities and related contaminants produced by the S. <i>roseosporus</i> fermentation culture.</p>
    <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">A preferred embodiment of the process chromatography method is described below: <ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li><i>Streptomyces roseosporus</i> is fermented with a feed of n-decanoic acid, as disclosed in United States Patent <patcit id="pcit-00042" dnum="US4885243A"><text>4,885,243</text></patcit>, with the modification that the decanoic acid feed is kept at the lowest levels possible without diminishing the overall yield of the fermentation. In a preferred embodiment, the residual decanoic acid is maintained at less than 50 parts per million (ppm) during aerobic fermentation. In a more preferred embodiment, the residual decanoic acid is maintained between one and 20 ppm during aerobic fermentation. In an even more preferred embodiment, the residual decanoic acid is maintained at approximately ten ppm during aerobic fermentation. In a preferred embodiment, the concentration of residual decanoic acid is measured throughout fermentation and the feed level of decanoic acid is adjusted to continuously keep the residual decanoic acid levels within the preferred parameters. The prior art does not describe the <i>in situ</i> specific and low residual constant decanoic acid concentrations required to achieve optimal expression of daptomycin containing lower levels of impurities.</li></ul></p>
    <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">After fermentation, the extracellular solution is clarified by removing the mycelia from the fermentation broth. Removing the mycelia from the fermentation is performed by any standard separation technique, such as centrifugation or microfiltration. In a preferred embodiment, the fermentation broth is clarified by microfiltration, such as by using a Pall Sepâ¢ membrane system. In a more preferred embodiment, the fermentation broth is clarified using an industrial centrifuge, such as a Westfaliaâ¢ centrifuge, followed by a finishing depth filter. Other devices, such as filter presses, rotary drum filters or disposable depth filters, may be used to remove mycelia from fermentation broth to produce a clarified broth suitable for large-scale column chromatography.</p>
    <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In another embodiment, daptomycin may be extracted from mycelial fermentation directly by using an organic solvent such as butanol prior to clarification on a solvent separating centrifuge or filter. Any alcohol with four carbons or more may be used in the extraction according to this embodiment. A preferred solvent is n-butanol. Using an organic solvent results in an initial additional purification of daptomycin compared to a purely aqueous separation of daptomycin. For example, daptomycin partitions into n-butanol when n-butanol is used in a concentration greater than 10% and when the process is conducted under conditions in which the n-butanol forms a separate phase, <i>e.g</i>., at a pH value of 4-5, which is near the isoelectric point of daptomycin (see Example 4).</p>
    <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In another embodiment, daptomycin is produced in an immobilized reactor that uses preactivated mycelia for the non-fermentation production of daptomycin using an energy source, preferably a sugar, elemental components, such as amino acids and ammonia, and decanoic acid. Production of daptomycin in an immobilized enzyme reactor is then processed by methods described herein.</p>
    <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">After clarification of the fermentation broth, the levels of daptomycin are enriched, (<i>i.e.</i> concentrated) in the clarified solution by anion exchange chromatography. The clarified solution is first contacted with an anion exchange resin under conditions in which most or all of daptomycin binds to the anion exchange resin. After binding, the resin is washed with an appropriate ionic aqueous buffer to remove unbound material and some of the daptomycin impurities. Finally, the purified daptomycin bound to the resin is eluted under conditions in which daptomycin will dissociate from the resin.</p>
    <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The binding, washing and elution steps may be performed according to this invention using buffers and methods known in the art. For instance, elution may be performed by using a buffer containing an elevated salt concentration compared to the wash buffer, a buffer that has a lower pH compared to the wash buffer, or a buffer that has both a higher salt concentration and a lower pH than the wash buffer. In a preferred embodiment, daptomycin is bound to the anion exchange resin that has been equilibrated in a buffer containing no added salt or a low salt concentration at a pH that is neutral to basic. The loaded resin is washed with three column bed volumes of water and then three to six bed volumes of an intermediate salt buffer containing 30 to 60 mM NaCl. Daptomycin is eluted from the column with one to three column volumes of an elevated salt and/or lower pH buffer containing 300 to 500 mM NaCl. Higher concentrations of sodium chloride and alternative salts such as potassium chloride will also elute daptomycin from the resin. In a preferred embodiment, a high flow rate anionic exchange resin is used. In a more preferred embodiment, FP-DA 13 resin (Mitsubishi) is used.</p>
    <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The anion exchange chromatography may be performed by column chromatography or may be accomplished in batch mode. For commercial production, it may be preferred to use batch mode. The anion exchange resin may be washed and eluted with stepwise salt gradients or with a continuous salt gradient. A suitable stepwise or continuous salt gradient is any one that permits the separation of daptomycin from contaminants. In a preferred embodiment, a continuous salt gradient is one which ranges from 0 to 1000 mM NaCl. In a more preferred embodiment, a continuous salt gradient is one which ranges from 100 to 500 mM NaCl or from 0 to 400 mM NaCl. Radial flow chromatography may also be used, as described in United States Patents <patcit id="pcit-00043" dnum="US5756680A"><text>5,756,680</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit-00044" dnum="US4865729A"><text>4,865,729</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit-00045" dnum="US4840730A"><text>4,840,730 </text></patcit>or <patcit id="pcit-00046" dnum="US4708782A"><text>4,708,782</text></patcit>.</p>
    <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">After anion exchange chromatography, the daptomycin preparation is further purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). One embodiment of this step is described in United States Patent <patcit id="pcit-00047" dnum="US4874843A"><text>4,874,843</text></patcit>, herein incorporated by reference. The eluted aqueous daptomycin preparation is contacted with a HIC resin under conditions in which most or all of daptomycin will bind to the resin. The water content of the daptomycin-loaded resin is reduced by contacting the resin with an increased concentration of a non-polar solvent. The resin is washed with an appropriate polar organic solvent under conditions in which impurities dissociate from the resin while daptomycin remains bound. Finally, the daptomycin preparation is eluted under conditions in which daptomycin dissociates from the resin. In general, daptomycin is eluted using a solvent-containing buffer with a lower polarity (higher polar solvent level) and/or higher pH than the wash buffer.</p>
    <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In a preferred embodiment, the non-functional resin for HIC is small particle HP-20ss (Mitsubishi). The bound daptomycin is specifically removed from the HP-20ss resin with an organic phase solvent, such as one containing isopropyl alcohol, acetonitrile, butanol or other suitable solvent. In a more preferred embodiment, daptomycin is bound to HP-20ss resin that has been equilibrated in an acetate buffer containing 10% acetonitrile or equivalent polar solvent, such as isopropyl alcohol. The daptomycin-loaded resin is washed with at least three column bed volumes of equilibration buffer. The daptomycin-loaded resin is further freed of additional impurities by washing with three to six bed volumes of an acetate wash buffer containing a non-eluting concentration of the polar solvent. In a preferred embodiment, the daptomycin-loaded resin is washed with 30% acetonitrile or 45% isopropyl alcohol. The daptomycin-loaded resin is eluted with one to three bed volumes of acetate buffer containing 35% or more acetonitrile or greater than 50% isopropyl alcohol. In a preferred embodiment, daptomycin is eluted with 35% acetonitrile at pH 4.0-5.0 or 55-60% isopropyl alcohol. In another embodiment, the daptomycin-loaded resin is eluted with one to three bed volumes of buffer at an increased pH. In this embodiment, the pH of the buffer is gradually increased to elute different compounds from the column at different rates due to charge differences. At elevated pH, <i>e.g</i>., pH 6.0-7.0, the elution concentration of acetonitrile is reduced to 10-20%. Similarly, at elevated pH, <i>e.g</i>., pH 6.0-7.0 the elution concentration of isopropyl alcohol is reduced to 20-25%. Control of the temperature under which chromatography is performed also influences solvent concentration. Elution at lower temperatures, i.e., under refrigerated conditions, requires increased levels of solvent at all pH conditions.</p>
    <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">After HIC, the organic solvent in the daptomycin preparation is reduced by anion exchange chromatography. In a preferred embodiment, FP-DA 13 is used as discussed <i>supra</i>.</p>
    <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">After the second anion exchange chromatography, the purified daptomycin is depyrogenated, filtered and concentrated under refrigerated conditions. Filtering daptomycin may be performed by any method known in the art. In one embodiment, filtering and depyrogenating may be performed by: <ol><li>i) providing a daptomycin solution under conditions in which the daptomycin is in a monomeric and nonmicellar state;</li><li>ii) filtering the daptomycin solution under conditions in which the daptomycin will pass through the filter but pyrogens will not pass through the filter, e.g., having the daptomycin solution at pH 6.0-8.0 and filtering the solution with an ultrafilter that is rated between 3,000 NMW and 30,000 NMW;</li><li>iii) altering the daptomycin solution that has passed through the filter such that the daptomycin aggregates, e.g., by changing the pH of the daptomycin solution to 2.5-4.5 such that daptomycin forms micelles;</li><li>iv) filtering the daptomycin solution under conditions in which the daptomycin will be retained on the filter, e.g., concentrating the daptomycin on an ultrafilter of 30,000 NMW or less, such as a reverse osmosis membrane; and</li><li>v) collecting the depyrogenated daptomycin.</li></ol></p>
    <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">In a preferred embodiment, daptomycin of step (ii) is filtered under pressure on a 10,000 dalton molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) ultra-filter at a pH of approximately 7-8. In a more preferred embodiment, daptomycin is at an initial concentration of less than 40 mg/ml, more preferably, at a concentration of approximately 31.25 mg/mL. Under these conditions, daptomycin passes through the filter but pyrogens such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) do not. After the initial ultra-filtration, the pH of the filtrate is lowered to pH 2.5 to 4.5 and the filtrate is concentrated on a 10,000 MWCO ultra-filter to approximately 120 mg/mL. Under these conditions, daptomycin is retained on the filter. In a preferred embodiment, the pH of the filtrate is pH 3.5. Subsequent to concentration, the concentration of daptomycin is adjusted to 105 mg/mL, checked for endotoxin levels, and used to fill vials under aseptic conditions.</p>
    <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">In another embodiment, reverse osmosis nanofiltration is performed at pH 1.5-3.0. The low pH and refrigerated conditions are used to retard degradation of purified daptomycin. Daptomycin may be further filtered through a 0.2 Âµm filter to reduce bioburden and then lyophilized either in bulk or in vials.</p>
    <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">As an alternative to the above ultra-filtration and concentration step, the eluted fractions containing daptomycin are mixed with butanol (either n-, iso- or t-butanol) at a pH of approximately 4.5, in a ratio of greater than one part butanol to nine parts daptomycin solution. In a preferred embodiment, one part butanol is mixed with four parts daptomycin solution to yield a 20% butanol solution. The butanol-daptomycin solution is allowed to separate into organic and aqueous phases. Daptomycin partitions into the organic phase, which is collected. The dehydration of daptomycin in the organic solvent may stabilize daptomycin and prevent the degradation of the purified daptomycin to anhydro-daptomycin and subsequent formation of Î²-isomer. Finally, daptomycin can be returned to the aqueous phase by adding buffer at pH 6.5-7.5 to the organic phase. After concentration or collection of daptomycin, daptomycin is lyophilized.</p>

    <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">Micelles are aggregates of amphipathic molecules. In aqueous media, the lipophilic parts of the molecules are oriented toward the interior of the micelle and the hydrophilic parts of the molecules are in contact with the aqueous media. Micelles form spontaneously in a solution containing amphipathic molecules if the concentration of the molecules is high enough.</p>
    <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">Micelle formation causes changes in several bulk physical properties of a solution including changes in osmotic pressure, turbidity, electrical conductance, surface tension, co-ion and counterion activities (in the case of ionic amphipathic molecules), refractive index, UV and NMR spectra, partial molar volume, viscosity, diffusion coefficient and dye solubilization. The cmc can be determined by measuring one or more of these micelle-dependent physical properties as a function of concentration of the amphipathic molecule. The size and shape of micelles can be determined by dynamic laser light scattering, ultracentrifugation, viscosity and/or low-angle X-ray scattering experiments. Micelles can also exist in liquid crystal phases.</p>
    <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">Lipopeptides may be aggregated into micelles by providing a concentration of lipopeptide that is greater than the cmc of the lipopeptide. The cmc is dependent upon the nature of the lipopeptide and the temperature, salt concentration and pH of the aqueous solution comprising the lipopeptide. With respect to the nature of the lipopeptide, the cmc of a lipopeptide is reduced by the addition of CH<sub>2</sub> groups to the lipophilic carbon chains. Thus, given the cmc for daptomycin at a particular salt concentration, temperature and pH, then an A-21978 type antibiotic in which the n-decanoyl fatty acid side chain is replaced by n-octanoyl, or -nonanoyl fatty acid side chain will have a higher cmc, while an A-21978 antibiotic in which the n-decanoyl fatty acid side chain of daptomycin is replaced by an n-undecanoyl, n-dodecanoyl, -tridecanoyl or n-tetradecanoyl fatty acid side chain will have a lower cmc relative to daptomycin.</p>
    <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">In one embodiment of the invention, the cmc of a lipopeptide may be manipulated by adding or subtracting a CH<sub>2</sub> group to the lipopeptide.

    <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">In another embodiment of the invention, the cmc of a lipopeptide is manipulated by changing the temperature of the solution comprising the lipopeptide. The cmc for a lipopeptide usually increases with increasing temperature of the solution. Thus, micelle formation is promoted by decreasing the temperature and is hindered by increasing the temperature. For instance, a solution comprising a lipopeptide may form micelles at 4Â°C because at that temperature the cmc is lowered and the lipopeptide concentration is above the cmc; however, the same lipopeptide solution may be monomeric at 20Â°C because the cmc has increased with the temperature and the lipopeptide concentration is now below the cmc. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the concentration of a lipopeptide is higher than the cmc at one temperature and is lower than the cmc at another, higher temperature. In a more preferred embodiment, the lipopeptide is daptomycin or a daptomycin-related molecule, such as those described <i>supra</i>. In an even more preferred embodiment, the lipopeptide is daptomycin.</p>

In another preferred embodiment, the ability to manipulate lipopeptide micelle formation by altering the temperature is used to make pharmaceutical compositions that are micellar under certain temperature conditions and monomeric under other temperature conditions.

    <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">In a further embodiment of the invention, the addition of an electrolyte is used to decrease the cmc of an ionic lipopeptide. In a preferred embodiment, a salt, such as NaCl, is added to a solution comprising lipopeptide to reduce the repulsion between charged groups in a lipopeptide micelle. In a preferred embodiment, the lipopeptide is daptomycin or a daptomycin-related molecule, such as that described <i>supra</i>. For instance, the peptide moiety of daptomycin contains three aspartic acid residues and an L-threo-3-methylglutamic acid residues (3-MG), all of which would be charged at neutral pH. Thus, addition of an electrolyte, such as NaCl or an equivalent salt, will decrease the cmc of daptomycin. In a preferred embodiment, the salt concentration is at least 100 mM.

In one embodiment, the pH is manipulated so that the concentration of a lipopeptide is higher than the cmc at one pH and is lower than the cmc at another pH. For instance, for daptomycin, the cmc at pH 4.0 in water at a temperature of 20-25Â°C was much lower than at pH 6.0 or 7.5. At pH 4.0, the cmc is approximately 400 Âµg/mL under these conditions.

Thus, for daptomycin, the cmc at pH 4.0 is lower than in solutions of either higher pH or lower pH.

Examples of such amphipathic molecules include, without limitation, medium and long chain fatty acids, phosphoglycerides (phospholipids), sphingomyelin, glycolipids and cholesterol. In one embodiment, medium chain-length alcohols can be incorporated into the micelle, where they reduce electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance, thus lowering the cmc of the lipopeptide.

    <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">In another aspect of the invention, the micellar solution is isolated and/or purified. In one embodiment, micelles are isolated from smaller substituents by ultrafiltration. The choice of ultrafiltration membrane will be based upon the size of the micelle. In general, a 10,000 NMW or 30,000 NMW membrane will be sufficient to retain micelles while permitting smaller substituents, such as contaminants to flow through. In another embodiment, micelles can be isolated and/or purified by dialysis, density gradient centrifugation or size exclusion chromatography. These methods are well-known in the art. In one embodiment, the micelles are more than 30% pure, where purity is measured as the weight of the micelles compared to the weight of monomeric forms of the lipopeptide or of other molecules. In a preferred embodiment, the micelles are more than 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95% pure.</p>
    <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">In another aspect of the invention, the ability to form lipopeptide micelles and then to disassociate them by altering temperature, pH, electrolyte concentration and/or lipopeptide concentration provides a method for purifying lipopeptides.

    <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">In another embodiment of the invention, the method comprises purifying a lipopeptide from high molecular weight contaminants, including pyrogens (e.g., lipopolysaccharide), by subjecting the lipopeptide to conditions under which the lipopeptide is monomeric and then separating the monomeric lipopeptide solution from the high molecular weight contaminants by a size separation technique.

In another preferred embodiment, the lipopeptide is daptomycin or related lipopeptide, such as A54145, the daptomycin-related lipopeptides disclosed <i>supra</i>, or an A-21978 antibiotic in which the n-decanoyl fatty acid side chain of daptomycin is replaced by an n-octanoyl, n-nonanoyl, n-undecanoyl, n-dodecanoyl, n-tridecanoyl or n-tetradecanoyl fatty acid side chain. In an even more preferred embodiment, the lipopeptide is daptomycin.</p>
    <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">A preferred embodiment of the process chromatography method using micelles to purify daptomycin is described below: <ul id="ul-00004-en" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li><i>Streptomyces roseosporus</i> is fermented with a feed of n-decanoic acid as described <i>supra</i>. After fermentation, the extracellular solution is clarified as described <i>supra</i>.</li></ul></p>
    <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">The clarified preparation is then applied to an anion exchange resin, such as FP-DA 13, as described <i>supra</i>. Daptomycin is eluted from the column with one to three column volumes of an elevated salt buffer containing 300 to 500 mM NaCl.</p>
    <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">The eluted daptomycin preparation is adjusted to a pH of 2.5 to 5.0 using an acid. In a preferred embodiment, the acid is dilute phosphoric acid. At pH 2.5 to 4.7, 300 to 500 mM NaCl and a temperature of 2-15Â°C, the daptomycin forms a micelle.</p>
    <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">The daptomycin preparation is filtered on a 10,000 to 30,000 NMW ultrafiltration membrane. During ultrafiltration, the daptomycin preparation is washed with a buffer containing 30 mM sodium acetate pH 3.5 and at temperatures of up to 15Â°C. The initial salt concentration is 300 mM NaCl due to the elution conditions, but the salt concentration decreases as washing continues. Because daptomycin is in micellar form, it is retained on the filter while impurities smaller than the 10,000 to 30,000 (depending upon the flter used), pass through the filter. The daptomycin preparation obtained is approximately 85-90% pure.</p>
    <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">As an optional step, the daptomycin preparation may be diluted and its pH raised to 6.5 in order to convert the daptomycin to a monomeric state. The daptomycin preparation is then be passed through a 10,000 NMW ultrafiltration membrane. This optional step decreases pyrogen content significantly.</p>

      <u>Methods for Analyzing Daptomycin Purity</u>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">Another embodiment of the invention provides analytical methods for measuring the purity of daptomycin.</p>
    <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">In the prior art, many of the contaminants that co-purified with daptomycin were unresolved or unidentified because the ability to visualize and measure impurities was limited by the analytical methods and equipment available. See, e.g., United States Patent <patcit id="pcit-00115" dnum="US4874843A"><text>4,874,843 and Kirsch et al.</text></patcit> The development of more sensitive analytical HPLC systems and techniques permits the resolution of a number of contaminants that exist in daptomycin batches prepared by prior art methods. The higher resolution HPLC methods demonstrate that daptomycin as purified by prior art methods is contaminated with previously identified impurities, such as anhydro-daptomycin and Î²-isomer, and other, previously unknown contaminants that co-purify with daptomycin (and co-elute under the previously established HPLC detection conditions) during the practice of prior art methods. Identification of these contaminants now permits the development of methods designed to eliminate these contaminants.</p>
    <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">As discussed above, anhydro-daptomycin and the Î²-isomer were previously described as impurities that persistently and consistently occurred during preparation of daptomycin. Using the HPLC analyses described here, an additional approximately twelve impurities produced during the production of daptomycin were distinguished, some of which had previously not been identified. These impurities were not removed after purification by the method disclosed in United States Patent <patcit id="pcit-00116" dnum="US4874843A"><text>4,874,843</text></patcit>. At least ten of these compounds have been identified (see, e.g., Figs. 2-11). Furthermore, at least six of these compounds are not the direct result of the reaction that produces anhydro-daptomycin and the Î²-isomer form of daptomycin, but rather are compounds produced by other, unrelated, processes that occur during the fermentation or purification of daptomycin. The method of the instant invention, described below, also significantly reduces the levels of a number of these impurities (see Examples).</p>
    <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">Any method known in the art may be used to measure the amount of other compounds in a daptomycin preparation. Methods for identifying daptomycin contaminants include, without limitation, mass spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, capillary electrophoresis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A preferred method for measuring the amount of other compounds in a daptomycin preparation is HPLC..</p>
    <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">Two methods were used to measure daptomycin impurities in the instant invention. The first method is a slightly lower resolution method than the second method. In both methods, a Shimadzu or HP HPLC System with PE Nelson's Turbochrom Software Version 4.1 is used.

In a preferred embodiment, the lipopeptide micelles are micelles comprising daptomycin or one or more daptomycin-related lipopeptides. All reference herein to lipopeptide micelles refers not only to all lipopeptide micelles, but specifically contemplates daptomycin, or related lipopeptide, such as A54145, the daptomycin-related lipopeptides disclosed <i>supra</i>, or an A-21978 antibiotic in which the n-decanoyl fatty acid side chain of daptomycin is replaced by an n-octanoyl, n-nonanoyl, n-andecanoyl, n-dodecanoyl, n-tridecanoyl or n-tetradecanoyl fatty acid side chain. Further, all references herein to lipopeptide micelles specifically contemplates spherical micelles, mixed micelles and liposomes, as discussed <i>supra</i>.</p>
    <p id="p-00111-en" num="0111">Purified lipopeptides, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, or lipopeptide micelles can be formulated for oral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, aerosol, topical or parenteral administration for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of diseases, particularly bacterial infections. In a preferred embodiment, the purified lipopeptide is purified daptomycin or a daptomycin-related lipopeptide.

    <p id="p-00112-en" num="0112">The compositions of the invention can be delivered using controlled ( e.g., capsules) or sustained release delivery systems (e.g., bioerodable matrices). Exemplary delayed release delivery systems for drug delivery that are suitable for administration of the compositions of the invention are described in <patcit id="pcit-00117" dnum="US4452775A"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 4,452,775 (issued to Kent</text></patcit>), <patcit id="pcit-00118" dnum="US5239660A"><text>5,239,660 (issued to Leonard</text></patcit>), <patcit id="pcit-00119" dnum="US3854480A"><text>3,854,480 (issued to Zaffaroni</text></patcit>).</p>

    <p id="p-00114-en" num="0114">Tablet binders that can be included are acacia, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone (Povidone), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sucrose, starch and ethylcellulose.</p>
    <p id="p-00115-en" num="0115">Lubricants that can be used include magnesium stearate or other metallic stearates, stearic acid, silicone fluid, talc, waxes, oils and colloidal silica.</p>
    <p id="p-00116-en" num="0116">Flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, cherry flavoring or the like can also be used. It may also be desirable to add a coloring agent to make the dosage form more aesthetic in appearance or to help identify the product.</p>
    <p id="p-00117-en" num="0117">For oral use, solid formulations such as tablets and capsules are particularly useful. Sustained release or enterically coated preparations may also be devised. For pediatric and geriatric applications, suspensions, syrups and chewable tablets are especially suitable. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions are in the form of, for example, a tablet, capsule, suspension or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a therapeutically-effective amount of the active ingredient. Examples of such dosage units are tablets and capsules. For therapeutic purposes, the tablets and capsules which can contain, in addition to the active ingredient, conventional carriers such as binding agents, for example, acacia gum, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sorbitol, or tragacanth; fillers, for example, calcium phosphate, glycine, lactose, maize-starch, sorbitol, or sucrose; lubricants, for example, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, silica, or talc; disintegrants, for example, potato starch, flavoring or coloring agents, or acceptable wetting agents. Oral liquid preparations generally are in the form of aqueous or oily solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, non-aqueous agents, preservatives, coloring agents and flavoring agents. Oral liquid preparations may comprise lipopeptide micelles or monomeric forms of the lipopeptide. Examples of additives for liquid preparations include acacia, almond oil, ethyl alcohol, fractionated coconut oil, gelatin, glucose syrup, glycerin, hydrogenated edible fats, lecithin, methyl cellulose, methyl or propyl <i>para</i>-hydroxybenzoate, propylene glycol, sorbitol, or sorbic acid.</p>
    <p id="p-00118-en" num="0118">For intravenous (IV) use, a water soluble form of daptomycin, daptomycin-related lipopeptide or other lipopeptide can be dissolved in any of the commonly used intravenous fluids and administered by infusion. For lipopeptide micelles, the lipopeptide is dissolved in an intravenous formulation under conditions in which the lipopeptide is present at a concentration above its cmc. One having ordinary skill in the art may vary the pH, temperature or salt concentration following the teachings of this invention to obtain an intravenous solution comprising lipopeptide micelles. Further, one may sonicate the lipopeptide solution in order to obtain lipopeptide liposomes. Intravenous formulations may include carriers, excipients or stabilizers including, without limitation, calcium, human serum albumin, citrate, acetate, calcium chloride, carbonate, and other salts. Intravenous fluids include, without limitation, physiological saline or Ringer's solution. Daptomycin or daptomycin-related lipopeptide also may be placed in injectors, cannulae, catheters and lines.</p>
    <p id="p-00119-en" num="0119">Formulations for parenteral administration can be in the form of aqueous or non-aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions or suspensions. These solutions or suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders or granules having one or more of the carriers mentioned for use in the formulations for oral administration. Lipopeptide micelles may be particularly desirable for parenteral administration. The compounds can be dissolved in polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, corn oil, benzyl alcohol, sodium chloride, and/or various buffers. For intramuscular preparations, a sterile formulation of a lipopeptide compound or a suitable soluble salt form of the compound, for example the hydrochloride salt, can be dissolved and administered in a pharmaceutical diluent such as Water-for-Injection (WFI), physiological saline or 5% glucose.</p>
    <p id="p-00120-en" num="0120">Lipopeptide micelles may be particularly desirable for parenteral administration because they are likely to cause no local irritation at the site of injection. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is likely that lipopeptide micelles will cause less local irritation than monomeric lipopeptides because the lipid tails, which might cause irritation upon injection, will be sequestered in the interior of the micelle, while the peptide nucleus, which is less likely to cause local irritation than the lipid tail, will be exposed to the tissue. Lipopeptide micelles may be prepared for intramuscular and parenteral preparations by following the teachings of this invention to obtain a preparation comprising lipopeptide micelles. Further, one may sonicate the lipopeptide solution in order to obtain lipopeptide liposomes. A suitable insoluble form of the compound also may be prepared and administered as a suspension in an aqueous base or a pharmaceutically acceptable oil base, e.g., an ester of a long chain fatty acid such as ethyl oleate.</p>
    <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">Injectable depot forms may be made by forming microencapsulated matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.</p>
    <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">For topical use the compounds and micelles of the present invention can also be prepared in suitable forms to be applied to the skin, or mucus membranes of the nose and throat, and can take the form of creams, ointments, liquid sprays or inhalants, lozenges, or throat paints. Such topical formulations further can include chemical compounds such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to facilitate surface penetration of the active ingredient.

    <p id="p-00131-en" num="0131">The method of the instant invention may be used to treat a patient having a bacterial infection in which the infection is caused or exacerbated by any type of gram-positive bacteria. In a preferred embodiment, purified daptomycin, daptomycin-related lipopeptide, other lipopeptide or pharmaceutical compositions thereof are administered to a patient according to the methods of this invention. In another preferred embodiment, the bacterial infection may be caused or exacerbated by bacterial including, but not limited to, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococci (including <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus,</i> and coagulase-negative staphylococci), glycopeptide intermediary-susceptible <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (GISA), penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant streptococci (including <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus avium, Streptococcus bovis</i>, <i>Streptococcus lactis</i>, <i>Streptococcus sangius</i> and <i>Streptococci</i> Group C, <i>Streptococci</i> Group G and viridans streptococci), enterococci (including vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant strains such as <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> and <i>Enterococcus faecium</i>), <i>Clostridium difficile</i>, <i>Clostridium clostridiiforme</i>, <i>Clostridium innocuum</i>, <i>Clostridium perfringens</i>, <i>Clostridium ramosum</i>, <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>, <i>Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterfum jeikeium</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i> spp., <i>Eubacterium aerofaciens, Eubacterium lentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus casei</i>, <i>Lactabacilllus plantarum</i>, <i>Lactococcus</i> spp., <i>Leuconostoc</i> spp., <i>Pediococcus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius</i>, <i>Peptostreptococcus asaccarolyticus</i>, <i>Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus productus</i>, <i>Propionibacterium acnes</i>, and <i>Actinomyces</i> spp.</p>
    <p id="p-00132-en" num="0132">The antibacterial activity of daptomycin against classically "resistant" strains is comparable to that against classically "susceptible" strains in <i>in vitro</i> experiments. In addition, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value for daptomycin against susceptible strains is typically 4-fold lower than that of vancomycin. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, purified daptomycin, daptomycin-related lipopeptide antibiotic, or pharmaceutical compositions thereof are administered according to the methods of this invention to a patient who exhibits a bacterial infection that is resistant to other antibiotics, including vancomycin. In addition, unlike glycopeptide antibiotics, daptomycin exhibits rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against gram-positive organisms. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, purified daptomycin, lipopeptide antibiotic, or pharmaceutical compositions thereof are administered according to the methods of this invention to a patient in need of rapidly acting antibiotic therapy.</p>
    <p id="p-00133-en" num="0133">The method of the instant invention may be used for a gram-positive bacterial infection of any organ or tissue in the body. These organs or tissue include, without limitation, skeletal muscle, skin, bloodstream, kidneys, heart, lung and bone. The method of the invention may be used to treat, without limitation, skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia and urinary tract infections. The method of the invention may be used to treat community acquired respiratory infections, including, without limitation, otitis media, sinusitis, chronic bronchitis and pneumonia, including pneumonia caused by drug-resistant <i>Streptoococcus pneumoniae</i> or <i>Haemophilus influenzae.</i> The method of the invention also may be used to treat mixed infections that comprise different types of gram-positive bacteria, or which comprise both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including aerobic, caprophilic or anaerobic bacteria. These types of infections include intra-abdominal infections and obstetrical/gynecological infections.

The diet for animals can be normal foodstuffs to which daptomycin or lipopeptide can be added or it can be added to a premix.</p>
    <p id="p-00135-en" num="0135">The method of the instant invention may also be practiced while concurrently administering one or more antifungal agents and/or one or more antibiotics other than daptomycin or other lipopeptide antibiotic. Co-administration of an antifungal agent and an antibiotic other than daptomycin or another lipopeptide antibiotic may be useful for mixed infections such as those caused by different types of gram-positive bacteria, those caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, or those that caused by both bacteria and fungus. Furthermore, daptomycin or other lipopeptide antibiotic may improve the toxicity profile of one or more co-administered antibiotics. It has been shown that administration of daptomycin and an aminoglycoside may ameliorate renal toxicity caused by the aminoglycoside. In a preferred embodiment, an antibiotic and/or antifungal agent may be administered concurrently with purified daptomycin, other lipopeptide antibiotic, or in pharmaceutical compositions comprising purified daptomycin or another lipopeptide antibiotic.</p>
    <p id="p-00136-en" num="0136">Co-administration of another therapeutic agent with daptomycin or another lipopeptide antibiotic may be performed using daptomycin or lipopeptide antibiotic in either a monomeric or micellar form. As discussed <i>supra</i>, spherical lipopeptide micelles can be used to help solubilize agents that exhibit low aqueous solubility. Further, lipopeptide liposomes can be used to trap agents that are soluble in aqueous media inside the vesicle of the liposomes. By following the teachings of the specification, one having ordinary skill in the art would be able to make lipopeptide micelles comprising therapeutic agents, such as anti-inflammatory agents, anti-fungal agents and other antibiotics.</p>

The residual decanoic acid feed is measured by gas chromatography and the target residual level is 10 ppm decanoic acid from the start of induction (approximately at hour 30) until harvest. Centrifugation of the culture and subsequent analysis of the clarified broth are used to measure the production of daptomycin by HPLC. The harvest titer is typically between 2.1 and 2.6 grams per liter of fermentation broth.</p>
    <p id="p-00143-en" num="0143">The fermentation is harvested either by microfiltration using a Pall-Sep or by full commercial-scale centrifugation and depth filter. The clarified broth is applied to an anion exchange resin, Mitsubishi FP-DA 13, washed with 30 mM NaCl at pH 6.5 and eluted with 300 mMNaCl at pH 6.0-6.5. Alternatively, the FP-DA 13 column is washed with 60 mM NaCl at pH 6.5 and eluted with 500 mM NaCl at pH 6.0-6.5. The eluate is applied to a HIC resin, HP-20ss, washed with 30% acetonitrile, and eluted with 35% acetonitrile at pH 4.0-5.0. Alternatively, the HIC resin is washed with 45% isopropyl alcohol and eluted with 55-60% isopropyl alcohol. The eluate is applied to FP-DA 13 resin and washed and eluted as before. The final anion exchange step reduces solvent by one third or more. Reverse osmosis diafiltration and concentration at pH 1.5-2.5 is performed using an 0.2 Âµm filter and the daptomycin preparation is frozen. A final reverse osmosis diafiltration is conducted with Water-For-Injection (WFI) to wash daptomycin and adjust its concentration prior to sterile-filling. Vials or bulk quantities of daptomycin are then lyophilized.</p>

The Column was washed with six column volumes of 60 mM NaCl in acetate buffer pH 6.0 containing 2M urea (the "wash buffer"). The wash buffer may vary from 50-75 mM NaCl. The wash removes virtually all anhydro-daptomycin. Daptomycin is eluted with sixteen column volumes of 250 mM NaCl in acetate buffer pH 6.0 containing 2M urea. Daptomycin is 98.5 to 99.5% pure as measured by the "first" HPLC method.</p>

    <p id="p-00152-en" num="0152">A daptomycin preparation as described in Example 2 was prepared using a method that significantly reduced the concentration of solvent required to perform the HP-20ss chromatography. Unexpectedly, the solvent for elution of daptomycin, 40% acetonitrile or 55-60% isopropyl alcohol, was reduced to 12% and 25%, respectively, when HP-20ss chromatography was conducted at neutral pH rather than acidic pH as described in United States Patent <patcit id="pcit-00133" dnum="US4874843A"><text>4,874,843</text></patcit>.

The column is washed with five to eight column bed volumes (CBV) wash buffer. An exemplary wash buffer is 5% isopropyl alcohol/60mM acetate, pH 6.6. Daptomycin is eluted from the column with elution buffer. An exemplary elution buffer is two to three CBV 25% isopropyl alcohol/60 mM acetate pH 6.6. The column is stripped with strip buffer. In one embodiment, the column is stripped with one CBV 40% isopropyl alcohol/60 mM acetate pH 6.6-7.0. The daptomycin solution is adjusted to pH 3.5-4.0 and is reloaded on to the HP-20ss column in order to further enhance purity. In one embodiment, the daptomycin eluted from the HP-20ss column at pH 6.5 is adjusted to pH 3.5 using 0.25M phosphoric acid. The daptomycin- solution is reloaded on the previously stripped HP-20ss column that has been equilibrated in 60 mM acetate, pH 3.5. The column is washed with a pH adjusting buffer such that the pH is 6.5. An exemplary pH adjusting buffer is five to eight CBV 5% isopropyl alcohol/60 mM acetate, pH 6.6. The daptomycin is eluted with elution buffer and may be further purified by anion exchange or other purification methods, if desired. The HP-20ss column is stripped with strip buffer and cleaned prior to reuse. An exemplary cleaning process includes washing with three CBV 0.5M NaOH, washing with one CBV water, and then washing with 0.25M phosphoric acid prior to equilibration. The column may be stored in 0.5M NaOH.</p>

    <p id="p-00156-en" num="0156">A fermentation culture of <i>S. roseosporus</i> NRRL Strain 15998 is conducted in a controlled decanoic acid feed fermentation at levels that optimize the production of the antibiotic while minimizing the production of contaminants. The residual decanoic acid feed is measured by gas chromatography and the target residual level is 10 ppm decanoic acid from the start of induction (approximately at hour 30) until harvest. Centrifugation of the culture and subsequent analysis of the clarified broth are used to measure the production of daptomycin by HPLC. The harvest titer is typically between 1.0 and 3.0 grams per liter of fermentation broth.</p>
    <p id="p-00157-en" num="0157">The fermentation is harvested either by microfiltration using a Pall-Sep or by full commercial-scale centrifugation and depth filter. The clarified broth is applied to an anion exchange resin, Mitsubishi FP-DA 13, washed with 30 mM NaCl at pH 6.5 and eluted with 300 mM NaCl at pH 6.0-6.5. Alternatively, the FP-DA 13 column is washed with 60 mM NaCl at pH 6.5 and eluted with 500 mM NaCl at pH 6.0-6.5. The pH is adjusted to 3.0 to 4.8 and the temperature is adjusted to 2-15 Â°C. Under these conditions, daptomycin forms a micelle. The micellar daptomycin solution is purified by washing the micellar preparation while it is retained on a ultrafilter using a 10,000 NMW filter (AG Technology Corp. UF hollow fiber or equivalent) in any configuration. The daptomycin micelles are retained by the filter, but a large number of impurities are eliminated because they pass through the 10,000 NMW filter. Ultrafiltration of daptomycin micelles increases daptomycin purity from approximately 40% to 80% or greater.</p>

Under these conditions of increased solvent and a higher pH of 6.0-7.5, daptomycin reverts to a single, non-micelle state. The eluate is applied to FP-DA 13 resin column and washed and eluted as before. The final anion exchange step reduces solvent by one third or more. Reverse osmosis diafiltration and concentration at pH 1.5-2.5 is performed using an 0.2 Âµm filter and the daptomycin preparation is frozen. A final reverse osmosis diafiltration is conducted with Water-For-Injection (WFI) to wash daptomycin and adjust its concentration prior to sterile-filling.
