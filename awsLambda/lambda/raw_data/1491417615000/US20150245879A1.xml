      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">This document relates generally to computer-aided orthopedic surgery, and more specifically to systems and methods for positioning a cut guide to a target bone and for altering the target bone using the cut guide.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The use of computers, robotics, and imaging to aid orthopedic surgery is well known in the art. There has been a great deal of study and development of computer-aided navigation and robotics systems used to guide surgical procedures. For example, a precision freehand sculptor (PFS) employs a robotic surgery system to assist the surgeon in accurately cutting a bone into a desired shape. In interventions such as total hip replacement, computer-aided surgery techniques have been used to improve the accuracy, reliability of the surgery. Orthopedic surgery guided by images has also been found useful in preplanning and guiding the correct anatomical position of displaced bone fragments in fractures, allowing a good fixation by osteosynthesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">A cut guide can be used in an orthopedic surgery to assist a surgeon in cutting or modifying some portions of a target bone. For example, in joint replacement surgeries such as total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR), a cut guide can be temporarily attached to the target bone such as a femur or a tibia. An orthopedic surgical cutting tool can be used together with the cut guide to allow the surgeon to selectively cut portions of the ends of the target bone and replaced with endoprosthetic implants. Positioning a cut guide for use in preparing the target bone can be a time consuming and complicated process, which is critical to positive outcomes for the patient.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Quick and reliable positioning of a cut guide can be crucial to the outcome of orthopedic surgeries such as prosthesis implantation. In joint replacement surgeries, for example, portions of the articulation tissues of a target bone, such as acetabulum, a femur, or a tibia, need to be resected and altered to allow an implant to be securely positioned onto the target bone. A cut guide positioned on the target bone can be used to guide a cutting saw to resect the target bone to a desired shape. Proper positioning of the cut guide on the bone can improve the accuracy of the bone resection and reduce procedure time. On the contrary, improper positioning of the cut guide can result in undesirable cutting surfaces on the target bone, which can further cause impingement, increased rates of implant dislocation, wear and failure of the implant, among many other complications. The procedure time can also be lengthened due to the requirement of modifying the undesirable cutting shape.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Positioning of cut guide onto a target bone usually requires a surgeon to mentally map and compare the shape, orientation, and relative positions of the implant and the target bones. This method can be difficult to operate and can suffer from lack of reliability and certainty. Determining and visualizing the correct positions and orientations of the prosthesis with respect to the target bone can be practically difficult. Computer-aided tools can be used to assist the surgeon in positioning the cut guide relative to the bone. However, often the computer-assistance is limited to intraoperative navigation of traditional cutting jigs. The designs of these jigs, the tools to align them, and the implants that they support are all compromises meant to serve a general population. Other systems uses computers to analyze patient specific images used to design patient-conforming instrumentation and sometimes even implants specific to the patient. However, these images either use ionizing radiation (e.g. computed tomography images) or are prone to error or gaps in tissue differentiation (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging). Therefore, the present inventors have recognized that there remains a considerable need for systems and methods that can assist the surgeon in reliably positioning a cut guide onto the target bone with improved accuracy, speed, and consistency, while still allowing for some customization for patient specific differences.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Various embodiments described herein can, among other things, help improve the efficacy and the reliability in positioning a cut guide onto a target bone to alter a portion of the target bone. For example, an orthopedic surgical device can comprise a primary positioning block. The orthopedic surgical device can comprise a secondary positioning component removably coupled to the primary positioning block, the secondary positioning component configured to: engage a prepared engagement feature machined into the target bone, and guide the primary positioning block to a predetermined position on a target bone. The orthopedic surgical device can comprise a first cutting block configured to: removably couple to the primary positioning block, and guide a cutting tool to cut the target bone.</p>

      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Total knee replacement surgery requires several precise cuts to be made in the femur and tibia in order for the chosen implant to fit correctly and to restore the geometry and kinematics of a natural healthy knee. To perform these steps, in both conventional (manual method) and Computer Aided Surgery (CAS) total knee replacement, a series of guide blocks are used that provide a drill or cutting guide to assist the surgeon to perform the steps required to prepare the femur and tibia for receiving the implant.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The conventional manual instrumented method used to prepare the femur for a knee replacement implant, outlined below as an example, generally includes fastening a distal cutting guide block on the femur, generally located by an intramedullary pin (IM rod) or screw inserted into the distal end of the femur and locating the distal guide block in the desired position, such position providing correct implant varus-valgus and transverse rotational angle about the IM rod and proper amount of distal resection; aligning a distal cutting guide, whether being integral with the guide block or a separate element fastenable thereto, in a predetermined location relative to the distal guide block reference position and inserting locating pins through the distal cutting guide and into the femoral condyles to fasten the cutting guide in place on the anterior surface; making the distal cut to resect the predetermined amount of bone from the distal end of the condyles; positioning a second femoral implant sizing guide (the femoral sizer) freely on the newly cut distal surface of the femur and ensuring that the anticipated resection level for the anterior cut, the anterior-posterior adjustment (referencing off either the existing posterior condyle or the anterior femur) for correct implant sizing, and that the rotational alignment and medial-lateral position of the positioning block are all correct before fixing the 4-in-1 cutting guide block in place with pins, drilling the implant peg holes; and performing the anterior and posterior cuts, and subsequently make the anterior-posterior chamfer and notch cuts. Note that adjusting rotation of the implant in the sagittal plane is generally not possible with the IM rod based instruments typically in use today. Thus, a femoral implant's position in knee extension is normally set parallel to the IM rod axis.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The steps required to prepare the tibia are less involved. Generally, they include: aligning the mechanical axis of the tibia; obtaining proper rotational (varus-valgus) alignment of the guide block, and fastening it in place to the anterior surface of the proximal end of the tibia; adjusting the vertical and angular position of the tibial guide block to ensure that the desired posterior slope and level of tibial resection are provided; inserting location pins using the guide block to fix its position on the tibia; removing the guide block and replacing it with a tibial resection cutting guide that is retained in place with the location pins; and resecting the chosen amount of tibial bone. Note that the final position of the tibial plate implant is not determined by this step, only the planar surface on which it will rest. Anterior-posterior (AP), medial-lateral (ML), and rotational positioning of the tibial plate implant are subsequently determined by the surgeon's judgment as to its best fitting location on the resected tibia after the femoral implant has been located and fixed to the resected femur.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The above described surgical procedure remains generally similar whether traditional or computer assisted surgery is being performed. A CAS system can employ passive or active trackable elements affixed to surgical tools and patient bone references, to permit the determination of position and orientation of the these objects in three-dimensional space. In certain types of CAS, preoperatively taken images or computer generated models created from preoperative patient scans, can be used to provide accurate patient specific anatomical information. The images or models can be used to registered or calibrate real-time position of the same patient's anatomical elements. This can permit subsequent tracking of the patient's anatomical elements and display of these anatomical elements relative to the surgical tools used during the surgery.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The use of a cutting/drill-positioning block having a position-identifying member, such as tracker assemblies, fastenable thereto and trackable by a camera based CAS system, for example, can be used in total knee replacement surgery. While such tracked femoral positioning guide blocks can provide significant advantages over traditional non-CAS instruments, the use of the CAS often leads to longer surgical times.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">As discussed above, total knee replacement procedures can include the same step-wise method of creating the necessary cuts on the femur in order to resect enough bone to permit the installation of the femoral implant. In conventional, or non-computer assisted, total knee replacement surgery, a distal cutting block is positioned and aligned by the surgeon and pinned in place on the anterior surface of the femur such that the cutting slot is aligned in the correct location for the distal cut. In CAS total knee replacement, the CAS navigation locates the distal pin drill guide position on the femur to accurately create the pin holes into which locating pins are inserted and employed to eventually fix the distal cutting guide. Generally, the distal drill/cutting guide member comprises part of an assembly, including an anterior guiding platform, that is fixed relative to the femur and on which the drill/cutting guide is displaceable proximally by a selected, measurable amount to locate the drill/cutting guide in a desired position relative to the anterior guiding platform and therefore relative to the distal end of the femur. A tracked guide block can be intramedullarly fastened to the femur, and the anterior guiding platform can engage with the tracked guide block. Depending on the type of implant being used, and once aligned with the most distal femoral condyle, the drill/cutting guide can be proximally displaced from the normal joint line on the fixed anterior guiding platform by a selected amount, corresponding to the amount of bone to be resected for the particular implant being used.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The use of CAS can improve the location of implant cutting guides, and by integrated reference, the implant location on the bone but generally, the use of CAS in previous procedures has not changed the basic method and sequence of performing the bone preparation.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Recently, an alternative CAS system that employs a pre-operative scanning procedure, typically a CT or a MRI, has been successfully demonstrated. The system provides shape based recognition of the bone and, by planning the desired implant location, is able to provide a fabricated, patient-specific cutting jig and a patient-specific implant device whose components can be aligned and altered by the physician prior to manufacturing, according to the specific patient's requirements and the physician's preference.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">A primary feature of this method is the use of pre-procedure imaging of the involved joint. The system software, typically provided as a service to the physician, calculates the geometrical information on the damaged bone, captured in CT or another suitable imaging format, and converts this information into a three-dimensional (3D) model of the bone surfaces. The converted 3D model includes information on corresponding bone dimensions. The surgeon, using the CAS, determines a femoral mechanical axis (FMA), femoral mechanical center (FMC), femoral anatomical axis (FAA) and tibial mechanical axis (TMA), and decides how and where the implant components should be placed on the bones of the particular patient. Once the planning is complete, the system software prepares and provides a computer file to direct rapid production machines, such as a computer numerical control (CNC) machine, a 3D printer machine, etc., to fabricate a patient specific, disposable cutting jig or a cutting guide device. The cutting jig and implant device can include a surface profile that matches the patient's bone surfaces in vivo, as predicted by the pre-procedure imaging scan, and can cause a specific fit of the cutting jig to only one position on the patient's knee.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Referencing to the geometry of the cutting jig surface profile, guiding holes for drilling and inspection, a slot feature for a sawing process, and bushing features for reaming and drilling can be fabricated into the cutting jig. During surgery, the patient specific cutting jig is fitted onto the predetermined location on the bone to guide critical cuts and shaping of the bone, such as drilling, reaming, sawing, etc., thus ensuring the surgeon's pre-determined and desired location of the implant on the patient's knee.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The above described CAS system uses a computer-aided calibration process that matches the surface of the cutting jig or implant device to the bone surface(s). Because the cutting jig or implant device is fabricated using CT scan image data, there is no need for use of a registration process, tracking systems or robotic systems in the operating room. The CAS system thus is designed to work in conjunction with manual standard TKA instrumentation and the cutting jig or implant device can provide a reduction in surgical time. However, the CAS system above requires the additional expense of the pre-procedure imaging scan as well as the time and cost for physician review, fabrication, sterilization, packaging and delivery of the patient specific cutting jig to the operating room. Additionally, the patient specific cutting jig is only suitable for the distal femoral cut and tibial cut. The 4-in-1 cutting block must still be placed for those cuts after the distal cut has been made. While the above CAS system can eliminate the use of the IM rod, during surgery, it has been found that the patient specific instrumentation (e.g., cutting jig) often does not fit well with the patient's anatomy, revealing a limitation of the accuracy of pre-procedure imaging technique. Adjustments to the patient's anatomy then must be made to ensure proper fitting, and this introduces the possibility of implant positioning errors.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The previously described systems used in total knee replacement surgery are still lacking in capability, accuracy, and efficiency of timely placement.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In an example, a computer controlled surgical instrument can be used in combination with an anatomical navigation system to place, size and locate specific machined areas onto the bone that will then unambiguously mate with size specific, non-patient specific, instrumentation. Such equipment can include, for example, the NAVIOÂ® Surgical System from Blue Belt Technologies, RIO robotic arm interactive orthopedic system from Mako Surgical, daVinci Surgical System from Intuitive Surgical, and other similar systems. The NAVIOÂ® system can be used effectively because its navigation component does not require pre-imaging of the patient and instead uses a navigated stylus to determine actual patient anatomic features in conjunction with fixed bone landmarks such as the femur and tibia. Systems and methods to use the NAVIOÂ® system are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,757,582, titled âMethods and Systems to Control a Shaping Toolâ to Brisson, et. al, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In an example, a database of implant sizes is contained in CAS navigational software. A surgeon, having fully mapped all of the key anatomical landmarks, can use the CAS system, in the example of a total or partial knee replacement, to calculate a femoral mechanical axis (FMA), femoral mechanical center (FMC), femoral anatomical axis (FAA) and tibial mechanical axis (TMA). With this compiled data, which is specific to the particular patient, the surgeon can use the planning aspect of the CAS software to position the articulating surface of the implants in virtual space and confirm, through range of motion of the actual joint, that the implant selection and positioning of the articulating surfaces is correct. Systems and methods to use a CAS system are described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/948,102, titled âComputer-aided Prosthesis Alignment,â filed on Mar. 5, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">At this point in the procedure, a typical CAS system would require the use of cutting guides and instruments that are capable of interacting with the CAS system, in order to be properly placed in preparation of making the final bone cuts. Alternatively, the MAKO system uses a robot arm to hold the cutting blocks in place, in proper relation to the bone about to be cut. In either case, once the planning step has finished, the next step for the surgeon is to fix the cutting guides in place, their position determined by the location of the articulating surfaces, relating them to the selected implant backside surface geometry, confirming the required bone resection for the particular implant size and then performing the bone cuts, a step that when completed, does not allow for any subsequent change in implant position, even if it is incorrect, due to poor or inadequate planning by the physician.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">In an example, the system described herein can improve the previously described systems for performing the surgery, and can allow for more interaction and confirmatory steps by the physician to help assure proper placement of the implant. For example, after virtual placement of the implant in the CAS system, instead of going directly to the positioning of the navigated cutting blocks, a system can use a navigated, controlled instrument (burr) of the NAVIOÂ® system to place a series of shallow burred areas (e.g., zones or engagement features) at specific locations on the bone that can provide for the specific location of the provided instruments on the bone, without the need for the instruments themselves to be navigated. Along with the implant database that is part of the CAS system, the database also can include additional information that relates specific locations on the backside of the implant with articulating surfaces. The combination of this system and additional implant data can allow the surgeon to make confirmatory judgment of the final implant position before irreversible bone resection has occurred. In another example, the system can allow for all of the bone cuts to be made using the combination of the navigated cutting zones and the generic instruments. This combination allows the CAS system to create a patient specific placement of the implants without the need for pre-imaging or the need for expensive, navigation capable instruments or expensive robotic arms. U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/946,428, titled âSystem and Methods for Positioning Bone Cut Guide,â filed on Feb. 28, 2014, is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">A method for operating on a target bone can include using a CAS system to determine a femoral mechanical axis (FMA), femoral mechanical center (FMC), femoral anatomical axis (FAA) and tibial mechanical axis (TMA) with typical fixed bone navigation trackers/markers and navigation methods. A navigated stylus can be used to record actual (patient specific) bone and articular surfaces such as the position, width or shape of the posterior condyles, width or shape of the distal condyle, width or position of the trochlear groove and sulcus on the anterior femur, width, slope, relative depth of the tibial plateau or position or shape of any eburnated bone on the tibial plateau or femoral condyle, or âWhiteside's lineâ. An implant can be virtually placed onto the bone and fitted for best size match, desired extension and flexion gap, varus-valgus alignment, distal position on the femur, proximal position on the tibia, matching of posterior, distal and sulcus articular surfaces with those of the femoral implant, rotation in the sagittal plane of the femoral implant or posterior slope of the tibial implant, or internal-external rotation of the implants.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In an example, since the implant geometry, specifically the femoral and polyethylene insert implant articulating surfaces, can be known to the CAS system via a database, the ML, AP, and rotation of the tibial components (tibial plate and polyethylene insert) can be aligned on the resected tibia to a best fit position relative to the femoral implant. This can avoid creating a mismatch of the femoral and tibial components during ambulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">After the virtual implant has been sized to the patient's anatomy, the computer can create virtual burr zones on the patient's joint surfaces that represent a typical (e.g., 3-4 mm) offset from the backside of the selected femoral and tibial implant at specific locations of the implant. These specific locations can include the midpoint (AP) of the distal cut surface, the vertex of the anterior chamfer and anterior cuts, along the deepest portion of the implant's trochlear groove, the distal surface of the tibial implant or other aspects of the tibial cutting guide.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">
        <figref>FIGS. 1A-B</figref> illustrate generally prepared engagement features (e.g., <b>102</b>), in accordance with some examples. In an example, for a femoral implant, after the regions for burring have been set virtually, the NAVIOÂ® system, or other CAS system, can control the cutting action of the engagement features (burrs) <b>102</b> and allow cutting in the zones identified (e.g., the burr zones). For example, a virtual model of the engagement features <b>102</b> on the bone <b>104</b> can be made and then cuts can be done as shown in views <b>100</b>A and <b>100</b>B. In an example, view <b>100</b>A includes a view of the bone <b>104</b> and engagement features <b>102</b> from front view and view <b>100</b>B includes a view of the bone <b>104</b> and engagement features <b>102</b> from a top view. The engagement features <b>102</b> can be cut into the bone <b>104</b> to provide burr zones for accepting a distal positioning component of an anterior distal positioning fixture. In an example, a system can include two or more engagement features to receive a positioning component or components. For example, four engagement features can be used to receive a distal positioning component of an anterior distal positioning fixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">A distal cut can be performed first as this burr zone can be located in such a manner that it is independent of final implant size selection. The surgeon can make this burr first on the most involved (degenerated) compartment (medial or lateral condyle) and see if adequate bone removal has been planned in the CAS system. He can also check the ML width of the implant selection with the provided size specific instruments. If adjustments need to be made, the surgeon can virtually move the implant (e.g., more or less proximal, ML rotation, AP rotation, etc.) in the CAS planning software and the other, remaining burr cuts can be adjusted accordingly.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Once the surgeon is satisfied with the implant size, the anterior bone resection location can be determined. For example, the location can be where the implant will merge with the anterior femur. The location can be determined with respect to determining if too much notching of the anterior femur will occur. In an example, since the instrument system is not tied to an IM rod based method, the femoral implant can be rotated in the sagittal plane to accommodate a different size and still make sure that the posterior positioning of the implant matches the patient's articular surfaces.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In an example, the medial-lateral position can be adjusted to provide a best match with the overall femoral width. In another example, the internal or external rotation can be adjusted so the implant's sulcus matches the patient's existing Whiteside's line (sulcus/trochlear groove) location. These adjustments can match the implant's trochlear groove with the patient's patella tracking Once all of the implant positional adjustments are made, the anterior and sulcus burr zones can be finished.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates generally an anterior distal positioning fixture <b>200</b> in accordance with some examples. The placement of burred cuts (e.g., engagement features <b>102</b> from <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) can allow for location specific positioning of a size-specific fixture. With placement of a size-specific Anterior/Distal Positioning Fixture <b>200</b> (ADPF), implant size, proper distal cut depth, AP position, ML position, or proper anterior flange width/depth can be confirmed. The confirmation of implant positioning or size is not possible at this point in a typical TKR procedure since significant bone resection has not yet occurred. Position of the ADPF <b>200</b> can be fixed with the placement of two or more headed screws or pins (e.g., screws <b>206</b>) into the anterior femur (e.g., bone <b>208</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In an example, the ADPF <b>200</b> can be placed on the bone <b>208</b>. A distal positioning component <b>202</b> of the ADPF <b>200</b> can be set in the burr zones (e.g., the engagement features of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). The distal positioning component <b>202</b> can be used to set a position for an anterior positioning block <b>204</b> of the ADPF <b>200</b>. A distal positioning component can include a specific example of a secondary positioning component and an anterior positioning block can include a specific example of a primary positioning block. The distal positioning component <b>202</b> can be removed after screws <b>206</b> are added to the anterior positioning block <b>204</b>. In an example, the burr zones (e.g., engagement features <b>102</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) are determined using a CAS system, then cut into the bone <b>208</b>. The distal positioning component <b>202</b> can be placed on the bone <b>208</b> in a position determined by the CAS system using the engagement features. The distal positioning component <b>202</b> can be used as a guide to properly place the anterior positioning block <b>204</b>. The anterior positioning block <b>204</b> can be used to place other cutting components to cut the bone <b>208</b>. The engagement features or burr zones can be cut into the bone <b>208</b> in unobtrusive areas on the bone <b>208</b>, (e.g., areas that do not affect functioning of the bone <b>208</b>, areas that will be cut again later, areas that do not cause pain, etc.). Using the distal positioning component <b>202</b> to guide the anterior positioning block <b>204</b> can allow for more accurate placement of the anterior positioning block <b>204</b> on the bone <b>208</b> or allow for the burr zones or engagement features to be placed in unobtrusive areas.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">
        <figref>FIGS. 3A-D</figref> illustrate generally a distal cutting block systems (e.g., <b>300</b>, <b>301</b>, or <b>303</b>) in accordance with some examples. In an example, a general cutting block can include a first cutting block or a distal cutting block. In an example, <figref>FIG. 3A</figref> shows a distal cutting block <b>304</b>. <figref>FIG. 3B</figref> shows the distal cutting block <b>204</b> in a distal cutting block system <b>300</b>. In an example, the distal cutting block system <b>300</b> of <figref>FIG. 3B</figref> includes an anterior cutting block <b>306</b> (e.g., the anterior positioning block <b>204</b> that was placed in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> by the distal positioning component <b>202</b>) and a bone <b>302</b>. The distal cutting block <b>304</b> can be placed in a position relative to the bone <b>302</b> that overlaps with a position for a distal positioning component used to place the anterior positioning block <b>304</b>. For example, a distal positioning component can be used to place the anterior positioning block <b>304</b> and then be removed followed by placement of the distal cutting block <b>306</b> placed as shown in <figref>FIG. 3B</figref>. The distal cutting block <b>306</b> can be used to make a distal cut, as shown in distal cutting block system <b>301</b> in <figref>FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In an example, after a distal positioning component is removed, a distal cutting block <b>306</b> can be attached to the remaining anterior positioning block <b>304</b>. A distal cut can be made using the distal cutting block <b>306</b>. The distal cutting block <b>306</b> can be removed after the distal cut is made, as shown in distal cutting block system <b>303</b> in <figref>FIG. 3D</figref>. The anterior positioning block <b>304</b> can remain in place. In an example, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref>, the distal cutting block <b>306</b> can be used to make a distal cut that removes areas around engagement features on the bone.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">
        <figref>FIGS. 4A-B</figref> illustrate generally a universal adapter <b>404</b> and a 4-in-1 cutting block <b>406</b> in accordance with some examples. <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> shows a universal adapter <b>404</b> that can be used in cutting block system <b>400</b> in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>. The universal adapter <b>404</b> can be used to attach the 4-in-1 cutting block <b>406</b> to the anterior positioning block <b>402</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>. With the use of the universal adapter <b>404</b>, a standard 4-in-1 cutting block (e.g., 4-in-1 cutting block <b>406</b>) can be attached to the anterior positioning block <b>402</b>. In an example, a femoral peg hole location can be done prior to attaching the 4-in-1 cutting block <b>406</b>. In another example, the surgeon can fine tune the ML positioning of the implant at this point using the cutting block system <b>400</b>. In an example, the universal adapter <b>404</b> assists the surgeon in positioning the 4-in-1 cutting block <b>406</b>, while allowing for adjustment in the ML positioning by sliding the 4-in-1 cutting block along a slot in the proximal surface that mates with tabs on the universal adapter <b>404</b>. The 4-in-1 cutting block <b>406</b> can be attached with screws or pins through peg hole locators or wing pinholes. For example, the distal positioning component and the 4-in-1 cutting block can re-use holes on the bone for attaching to the bone.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In an example, connecting a component or block to a bone using holes on the bone or the component can cause positive engagement of the component or block with the bone. This can improve accuracy of subsequent bone cuts. For example, a component or block can be loosely fitted to a bone and then tightened to an accurate engagement position by screwing or pinning the component or block to the bone.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The anterior positioning block <b>402</b> and the universal adapter <b>404</b> can be removed after the 4-in-1 cutting block <b>406</b> is secure or attached. In an example, the universal adapter <b>404</b> or 4-in-1 cutting block <b>406</b> can be positioned relative to the bone in positions that overlap a portion of one or more of the areas previously occupied by the distal cutting block or the distal positioning component. For example, two or more of the distal cutting block, distal positioning component, universal adapter, or 4-in-1 cutting block <b>406</b> can attach to a same face of the anterior positioning block <b>402</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In another example, the femur can be prepared using navigated holes that can result in further substantial time-savings. By using the navigated holes, steps can be eliminated from a standard procedure, including use of the traditional IM distal cut apparatus, use of the femoral sizer apparatus, or determination of the cutting position blocks location.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In yet another example, the methods and systems described can be used in a minimally invasive surgery (MIS) total knee replacement (TKR). For example, a positioning block or positioning component can include a medial or lateral positioning block or positioning component. A positioning block or component can be designed for use in a MIS TKR or can be used without modification from those used for a typical TKR. The MIS TKR can include a positioning block or component used to avoid muscle (e.g., muscle sparing) or when using minimal arthrotomy length. In non-typical, non-MIS, procedures, devices, components, blocks, etc., described herein can be modified for use in special circumstances. For example, if everted patella or typical arthrotomy length are not present in a procedure, one or more of the components, blocks, devices, cuts, etc., can be modified to aid in surgery.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Various components, blocks, devices, instruments, etc., described herein can be re-used or be disposable after one use. For example, one or more of an anterior positioning block, distal positioning component, distal cutting block, 4-in-1 cutting block, universal adapter, tibial cutting block, tibial plate trial, or navigation positioner can be disposable and used only once, or can be re-used. In an example, one or more of the components, blocks, etc., described herein can include a material that allows for deformation. For example, a component or block can be made with a spring-like material (e.g., rubber, plastic, etc.) that allows a positive engagement with a bone via bending displacement. In an example, a component or block can be manufactured or fabricated as a single, unitary component or block. In another example, a component or block can be manufactured or fabricated in parts (e.g., two parts combined to make a component or block). Manufacturing or fabricating a tibial component in parts can facilitate a positive or locking connection to a bone.

      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">In an example, additional operating room (OR) time that might be added by the use of a navigation procedure can be made up by use of the NAVIOÂ® optimized instruments. The methods and systems described herein can include a âPatient Specificâ knee implantation without using pre-procedure imaging or patient specific cutting guides or patient specific implants.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">
        <figref>FIGS. 5A-B</figref> illustrate generally a tibial cutting block (e.g., <b>504</b>A or <b>504</b>B) in accordance with some examples. In an example, tibial preparations can be done in a similar manner to the methods and using the systems as described above for a femur (or other bone). For tibial preparations, an implant can be pre-positioned using the NAVIOÂ® Software during a planning phase. Using the NAVIOÂ® software, a cutting plane can be determined using a best-fit implant size and position.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In an example, the NAVIOÂ® system can determine simple burred regions (e.g., three (3) or four (4) burr regions or zonesâcreating engagement features on the tibia) of the bone <b>502</b> that provide a correct posterior slope angle for the location of a tibial cutting block (e.g., <b>504</b>A or <b>504</b>B). A single left (L) or right (R) cutter can be used for any size implants. As shown in <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>, tibial cutting system <b>500</b> can include the bone <b>502</b> (e.g., tibia) and the tibial cutting block <b>504</b>A. Other versions of a tibial cutting block can be used (e.g., <b>504</b>B shown in <figref>FIG. 5B</figref>). In another example, an integrated positioning and cutting guide block can be used for positioning and location.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In an example, after the positional burr cuts have been made to create engagement features, the tibial cutting block (e.g., <b>504</b>A or <b>504</b>B) can be placed in an unambiguous manner onto the tibia. The tibial cutting block (e.g., <b>504</b>A or <b>504</b>B) can be pinned in place with headed or non-headed pins to secure the guide during the subsequent bone-cutting operation. After a tibial cut has been made using the tibial cutting block (e.g., <b>504</b>A or <b>504</b>B), a tibial trial plate or an appropriate polyethylene insert trials of an appropriate thickness can be used to check for an appropriate knee joint extension or flexion gap. In an example, the tibial cutting block (e.g., <b>504</b>A or <b>504</b>B) can be removed prior to installing the tibial trial plate or polyethylene insert trial. In an example, a change to a slope angle can be done by repositioning the system. The system can be reused for a re-cutting procedure or a special re-cutting tibial cutting block can be used to increase the cutting depth or change the posterior slope of the tibial cut.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The implant geometry, specifically the femoral and polyethylene insert implant articulating surfaces, can be known to the CAS system via a database, and the ML rotation or AP rotation of the tibial components (tibial plate or polyethylene insert) can be aligned on the resected tibia. For example, the alignment can include a best fit position relative to the femoral implant so as not to create a mismatch of the femoral or tibial components during ambulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">During extension of the knee, it is particularly important to align the articulating surface of the femoral and polyethylene inserts properly. Improper alignment can result in asymmetrical loading of the medial and lateral compartments, which can cause patient discomfort, sudden shifts in the knee position, or rapid rates of polyethylene wear. Asymmetrical loading can also cause the potential for cemented component loosening from the bone.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">
        <figref>FIGS. 6A-B</figref> illustrate generally a properly placed femoral implant (e.g., <b>600</b>A or <b>600</b>B) in accordance with some examples. As shown in <figref>FIG. 6A</figref>, a ML cross-section, and as shown in <figref>FIG. 6B</figref>, an AP view, of a typical femoral implant in extension can be ideally located on the polyethylene insert. <figref>FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> demonstrate a desired relationship between the femoral and tibial components when the leg is in the weight-bearing extension position.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">
        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> illustrates generally improperly placed femoral implants (e.g., <b>700</b>A, <b>700</b>B, <b>700</b>C, <b>700</b>D, or <b>700</b>E) in accordance with some examples. Various examples in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> show that any mal-rotation of the relative implant positions can cause localized areas of increased loading of the polyethylene insert and resultant abnormal rotation (either external or internal) of the tibial bone relative to the femur for the patient during ambulation, resulting in abnormal wear of the polyethylene insert and pain or discomfort for the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">
        <figref>FIG. 8</figref> illustrates generally a tibial plate trial <b>804</b> and navigation positioner <b>806</b> in accordance with some examples. To aid in minimizing the chance for tibial plate positioning errors, using a navigation system, a navigated positioner <b>806</b> can be attached to the tibial plate trial <b>804</b> prior to the punching of the tibia <b>802</b> for tibial keel in a tibial implant placement system <b>800</b>. Pins <b>808</b> can be used to attach the tibial plate trial <b>804</b> to the tibia <b>802</b>. In an example, the pins previously placed to secure the tibial cut guide can be used to minimize the chance for tibial plate positioning errors. For example, the navigated burr zones have been used to locate the cutting guide and to determine the pin position, and can be used in conjunction with a guiding device that interfaces with both the tibial plate trial and these pins. This can set ML rotational orientations of the tibial plate trial per the navigation plan. The AP location can be confirmed by placing the stylus onto a known reference on the tibial plate, where the null point of the tibial (e.g., polyethylene) insert location can be positioned to line up with the extension position of the femoral implant.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">In yet another example, the most anterior burr zones can be made slightly deeper into the tibial plateau. This can allow the burr zones to still be visible after the tibial cut has been made. The burr zones can also be used to identify the anterior edge of the trial tibial plate for AP location. This, in combination with the ML or rotational placement dictated by the pin placement, can locate the trial tibial plate in an optimal position on the tibia and relative to the previously located femoral trial on the femur. As a result, the implants, and consequently the femur and tibia, can be in ideal positions to one another to maximize patient comfort and to maximize functioning of the knee and the implants.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">In the examples described above and illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1A-5B</figref>, some of the positioning components (e.g., anterior positioning block or distal positioning component) are discussed as involving multiple mating components that couple together during use to form a complete positioning component or guide. In some examples, a unitary positioning component is used that can be fabricated from deformable (e.g., spring-like) materials that will snap into engagement features machined into the bone. Applications of the discussed instrumentation and techniques may be modified in certain ways, such as unitary positioning components or multi-part positioning components, depending upon the requirements of the particular procedure or target joint (e.g., elbow, hip, shoulder, etc . . . ).</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The examples described above may reference positioning components or cut guides by particular names that may indicate how the particular piece of instrumentation is used in the example procedure, such as the anterior positioning block). These specific names are used solely to provide additional clarity within the described example procedure. The positioning component concepts and related tools for creation of engagement features discussed are applicable to other procedures involving resection of bone or soft tissue within various anatomical locations.</p>
