The rehabilitation device may include a plurality of modular canes, a plurality of rollers, at least one divider, a first end cap and a second end cap. Each tubular modular cane may terminate in the first end and an opposing second end. The second end diameter may be sized to slidably receive the first end. The second end cap may have a second connection end sized to slidably receive the first end. The first end cap may have first connection end adapted to slidably receive the second end. The plurality of rollers may be made of compressible material. The plurality of rollers may be mounted on the plurality of modular canes so that the rehabilitation device may have an adjustable length with interchangeable rollers. The plurality of rollers may be separated by at least one divider so as to adjust the spacing of the plurality of rollers.</p>

      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to medical rehabilitation and treatments and, more particularly, to a device for rehabbing and treating painful soft tissues and scar breakdown.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Currently, message implements are bulky, used for a single or limited purpose and or do not allow for adequate treatment of different body parts and conditions. The existing devices function on the principle âone size fits all.â As a result, patients are forced to use various, non-compatible devices to address their multi-faceted needs. This in turn results in patients foregoing treatment, increased expenses as well as problems with clutter and storage. Moreover, the current devices are not designed to simultaneously treating different muscle groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">As can be seen, there is a need for a compact device that can be reconfigured to target different anatomic areas while applying a physiological approach, including simultaneously treatment of different muscle groups.</p>

      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The plurality of rollers <b>40</b> may be tubular elements having an interior roller surface <b>52</b> and an exterior roller surface <b>54</b>. The plurality of rollers <b>40</b> may be made of material that is conducive to storing thermal energy. For example, such material may be heated by a heat source and or cooled by a cooling source. The plurality of rollers <b>40</b> may be made of compressible material such as but not limited to foam and the like. The plurality of rollers <b>40</b> may be sized to conform the rehabilitation device <b>10</b> to selected areas of the body. The interior roller surface <b>52</b> may be rotatably mounted to each modular cane <b>12</b> exterior surface <b>16</b>. The plurality of rollers <b>40</b> may include a smooth roller <b>44</b>, a contoured roller, a textured roller <b>18</b>, <b>46</b>, a grooved roller and a ribbed roller <b>48</b> of various shapes, including but not limited to spherical <b>42</b>, cylindrical <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, oblong and the like, and sizes. The grooved rollers may include a plurality of radially projecting fingers disposed along the exterior roller surface <b>54</b>. The plurality of rollers <b>40</b> may be mounted to rotate independently of each other. The plurality of rollers <b>40</b> may be separated by at least one divider <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The at least one divider <b>20</b> may be tubular elements adapted to slidably receive the plurality of modular canes <b>12</b>. The at least one divider <b>20</b> may form a tubular opening <b>28</b> large enough so that a divider <b>20</b> may slide over the handle end <b>21</b>. The at least one divider <b>20</b> may include a set screw hole <b>27</b> and a set screw <b>26</b> so as to removably attached along the modular cane <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In operation, the rehabilitation device <b>10</b> may be self-administered by a user <b>50</b> or the user <b>50</b> may administer the massage implement on a second person. A method of using the present invention may include the following. The rehabilitation device <b>10</b> disclosed above may be provided. The user <b>50</b> utilizing the rehabilitation device <b>10</b> may mount at least two of the plurality of rollers <b>40</b> to the modular cane <b>12</b>. Because of the size and shape of the rollers <b>40</b>, in certain embodiments each roller's outer contour tapers toward the other adjacent roller, the user <b>50</b> may be able to effectively conform the rehabilitation device <b>10</b> to selected areas of the body, such as but not limited to muscle groups, muscle tissue, scar tissue, tendons, trigger points and the like. Such conformity to the selected body part and between at least two of the plurality of rollers <b>40</b> enables self-administration of the rehabilitation device <b>10</b> by use of self-weight without the use of any hands, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The user <b>50</b> may roll a portion of the selected body parts under self-weight over the at least two of the plurality of rollers <b>40</b>. In certain embodiments, the user may add at least one spacer <b>20</b> between the at least two of the plurality of rollers <b>40</b> to facilitate such conformity. In certain embodiments, the user <b>50</b> may self-administer by self-weight using one roller <b>40</b>, such one-roller selections are illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 9 through 11</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Utilization of the user's <b>50</b> self-weight under the self-administered, no-hands system disclosed above may facilitate relaxation of the applied-to muscle tissue so as to uniquely stimulate a plurality of receptors in the muscle/tendon juncture, whereby the present invention provides superior benefits. As a result, the rehabilitations device <b>10</b> may be useful in providing physiological effects known as self-myofascial release. Myofascial release alleviates muscle pain by relieving myofascial trigger points within the muscle tissue and/or by releasing lactic acid and other toxins from a person's muscle, whereby the additional benefits of the relaxation garnered by the self-administration is within the scope of the present invention. Significantly, prior art is self-applied by gripping at least one handle.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In certain embodiments, a user <b>50</b> utilizing the rehabilitation device <b>10</b> may grasp one or both of the distal ends of the rehabilitation device <b>10</b> near the end caps <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and apply at least one of the rollers <b>40</b> to a body area to be rehabilitated. The user <b>50</b> can then apply force to one or more of the distal ends, so as to distribute the force of the at least one of the rollers <b>40</b> to the area to be rehabilitated.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The method of the invention includes the steps of selecting the appropriate one or plurality of rollers <b>40</b> and possibly at least one spacer <b>20</b> described above and then configuring the selections in an anatomically appropriate manner to rehabilitate a selected area of the body. The rehabilitation device <b>10</b> may be easily adjusted, re-adjusted, spaced and re-spaced during one physical therapy and or rehabilitation session. Likewise, the rehabilitation device <b>10</b> may be then re-configured to the specific anatomy of a different user. The plurality of rollers <b>40</b> may address different muscle groups simultaneously. The different shapes of the rollers <b>40</b> and their ready reconfigurations along the plurality of modular canes <b>12</b> may afford varied implementations across specific anatomical locations with different needs.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">It should be understood, of course, that the foregoing relates to exemplary embodiments of the invention and that modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.</p>
