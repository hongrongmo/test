    <summary>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Severe acute kidney injury (AKI) is remarkably common and has an unacceptably high mortality that has been unchanged for the last twenty years. AKI therapies that have been developed in experimental models when administered prior to the onset of injury have failed to show therapeutic benefit in humans. However, the kidney has an innate capacity to undergo epithelial regeneration following injury, suggesting that drugs that enhance this regenerative capacity are more likely to be of benefit when given after the onset of injury.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">AKI is a multi-factorial disorder that occurs in approximately 7% of in-patients hospital admissions. It is an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. Severe AKI requiring renal replacement therapy occurs in 4% of critically ill patients and has 50% in-patient mortality. Long term follow up studies in survivors of severe AKI indicate that approximately 12.5% become dialysis-dependent. Despite these sobering statistics, renal replacement is the only approved therapy for AKI, and there are no established therapies that have been proven to prevent renal injury or accelerate the rate of renal recovery following induction of AKI in man. Therefore there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies that will accelerate the rate of recovery following induction of renal injury. WO 2012109527 provides examples of certain useful therapies.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Provided herein are novel, non-toxic therapeutic agents that accelerate recovery from AKI by enhancing the innate regenerative capacity of the kidney, thereby identifying a number of lead compounds with a high probability of targeted translatability for application in human AKI. A state of the art, high content functional screen using transgenic zebrafish embryos was developed to identify compounds that cause expansion of embryonic renal progenitor cells. This strategy was validated by identifying a unique and novel class of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) that increase the rate of recovery in a mouse model of AKI. These findings point to a promising role for this class of small molecules in patients with AKI.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 31</figref>. HDACis enhance RA signaling. (A) In the absence of RA, RAR/RXR dimers recruit a corepressor complex (CoR) containing an HDAC. The HDAC deacetylates nucleosomes, causing chromatin condensation and preventing transcription. (B) In the presence of RA, the RAR/RXR dimer undergoes a conformational change, removing the HDAC from close association with nucleosomes. This allows coactivators such as a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) to acetylate the nucleosomes, which decondenses the chromatin and permits transcription. (C) HDAC inhibitors, such as PTBA, have been hypothesized to decrease the required concentration of RA necessary to trigger the RAR/RXR conformational switch.

Compositions also are provided for delivery of the compounds to a patient. Also provided are methods for improving kidney function, inhibiting a histone deacylase in a cell, expand renal progenitor cells and/or stimulating kidney repair in cells in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo (in a patient) comprising contacting the cells with, or administering to a patient and amount of one or more of the compounds effective to improve kidney function in a patient, inhibit a histone deacylase in a cell, expand renal progenitor cells and/or stimulate kidney repair in cells.

      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0061">The lead compound, PTBA, is unique in that it has relatively low toxicity when compared with several other established HDACi in zebrafish toxicity assays (see below), and a unique thioester moiety in the position of the connecting unit, a site that is typically occupied by an amide bond and has recently gained interest as a target for new drug design efforts. These findings have great potential because they identify for the first time a class of compounds that are non-toxic and accelerate renal recovery by enhancing the innate potential of renal tubular epithelium to regenerate following injury. By validating the use of this screening strategy, our preliminary studies also indicate that this strategy can be used to identify chemical modifications and synergistic interactions that will enhance the regenerative capacity of lead compounds both in the zebrafish embryo and subsequently in mouse models of AKI. Thus the examples presented below provide a unique opportunity to develop a panel of compounds that could have a real impact on the clinical outcome of a large number of patients presenting with AKI, particularly those with severe AKI in which potentially the majority of naturally occurring self-renewing epithelial cells have been depleted. In <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, exemplary HDACi analogues of PTBA are shown, with PTBA in the center. Potential HDACi analogue families to test include: esterified compounds; esterified compounds with bulk added to the phenol ring for increased LogP; hydroxamic compounds with bi-dentate zinc chelator; hydroxamic compounds with bulk added to the phenol ring for increased LogP; and, other proven HDACi, such as SAHA and TSA.</p>

      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0064">Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of any of the compounds described herein also may be used in the methods described herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of the compounds described herein may be prepared by conventional methods known in the pharmaceutical arts, and include as a class veterinarily acceptable salts. For example and without limitation, where a compound comprises a carboxylic acid group, a suitable salt thereof may be formed by reacting the compound with an appropriate base to provide the corresponding base addition salt. Non-limiting examples include: alkali metal hydroxides, such as potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide; alkaline earth metal hydroxides, such as barium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; alkali metal alkoxides, such as potassium ethanolate and sodium propanolate; and various organic bases such as piperidine, diethanolamine, and N-methylglutamine.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0065">Acid and base addition salts may be prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of a desired acid or base to produce the salt in a manner known in the art. The free base may be regenerated by contacting the salt form with a base or acid (depending on the nature of the salt) and isolating the free base. The free base forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to their respective free base forms for purposes described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0066">Compounds comprising basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with such agents as C<sub>1-4 </sub>alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, iso-propyl and tert-butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; C<sub>1-4 </sub>alkyl sulfate such as dimethyl, diethyl and diamyl sulfates; C<sub>10-18 </sub>alkyl halides, such as decyl, dodecyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; and aryl-C<sub>1-4 </sub>alkyl halides, such as benzyl chloride and phenethyl bromide. Such salts permit the preparation of both water-soluble and oil-soluble compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0067">Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutically-acceptable base salts include: aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, and zinc salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include, without limitation: salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, chloroprocaine, choline, N,Nâ²-dibenzylethylenediamine (benzathine), dicyclohexylamine, diethanolamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylamino ethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, iso-propylamine, lidocaine, lysine, meglumine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, morpholine, piperazine, pip eridine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethanolamine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, and tris-(hydroxymethyl)-methylamine (tromethamine).</p>

      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0074">In any case, as used herein, any agent or agents used for improving kidney function, inhibiting a histone deacylase in a cell, expanding a population of renal progenitor cells and/or stimulating kidney repair in cells in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo is administered in an amount effective to improve kidney function, to inhibit a histone deacylase in a cell, to expand renal progenitor cells and/or to stimulate kidney repair in cells in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo, namely in an amount and in a dosage regimen effective to improve kidney function, inhibit a histone deacylase in a cell, expand renal progenitor cells and/or stimulate kidney repair in cells in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo. According to one non-limiting embodiment, an effective dose ranges from 0.05 to 200 mg/kg/day, and in certain embodiments less than 100 mg/kg/day, including any increment or range therebetween, including 0.1 mg/kg/day, 0.5 mg/kg/day, 1 mg/kg/day, 5 mg/kg/day, 10 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, 25 mg/kg/day, 50 mg/kg/day, 75 mg/kg/day, 100 mg/kg/day, etc. However, for each compound described herein, an effective dose or dose range is expected to vary from that of other compounds described herein for any number of reasons, including the molecular weight of the compound, bioavailability in the dosage form, route of administration, specific activity (e.g., EC<sub>50</sub>), etc. In vitro (including ex vivo), the composition is used, for example, in culture medium. Exemplary and non-limiting effective ranges range from 100 nM to 25 Î¼M, 200 nM to 3 Î¼M, 200 nM to 1.5 nM, including all increments therebetween. Once again, the effective range and optimal concentration range depends on the specific activity (e.g., EC<sub>50</sub>) of the composition, as well as a variety of other conditions. In any case, the effective range (e.g., the therapeutic window) between the minimally-effective dose, and maximum tolerable dose in a subject can be determined empirically by a person of skill in the art, with end points being determinable by in vitro and in vivo assays, such as those described herein and/or are acceptable in the pharmaceutical and medical arts for obtaining such information regarding agents, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors. Different concentrations of the agents described herein are expected to achieve similar results. The compounds can be administered orally one or more times daily, for example two to four times daily, once every two, three, four, five or more days, weekly, monthly, etc., including increments therebetween. In certain delivery methods, it is possible to deliver the drug continuously, or substantially continuously as in the case of for example, intravenous or transdermal delivery routes. A person of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical and medical arts will appreciate that it will be a matter of design choice and/or optimization to identify a suitable dosage regimen for improving kidney function, inhibiting a histone deacylase in a cell, expand renal progenitor cells and/or stimulating kidney repair in cells in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo.</p>

According to one example, the drug product described herein is an oral tablet, capsule, caplet, liquid-filled or gel-filled capsule, etc. Compositions may comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, or excipient. An excipient is an inactive substance used as a carrier for the active ingredients of a medication. Although âinactive,â excipients may facilitate and aid in increasing the delivery, stability or bioavailability of an active ingredient in a drug product. Non-limiting examples of useful excipients include: antiadherents, binders, rheology modifiers, coatings, disintegrants, emulsifiers, oils, buffers, salts, acids, bases, fillers, diluents, solvents, flavors, colorants, glidants, lubricants, preservatives, antioxidants, sorbents, vitamins, sweeteners, etc., as are available in the pharmaceutical/compounding arts.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0078">According to one non-limiting embodiment, the compounds described herein are complexed with a cyclodextrin. Cyclodextrins are compounds that have found substantial recognition as excipients (e.g., as carriers, vehicles, etc.) in the pharmaceutical field, for example in oral and intravenous dosage forms. Cyclodextrins are able form non-covalent inclusion complexes and/or aggregates in solution with poorly soluble drugs, for example, BCS Class II and IV drugs (high or low intestinal permeability, respectively, but low solubility in both instances). Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides having a hydrophilic outer surface and a lipophilic central cavity. They consist of Î±-1,4-linked Î±-D-glucopyranose units. Naturally-occurring cyclodextrins include Î±-, Î²- and Î³-cyclodextrins, with 6, 7 and 8 glucopyranose units, respectively. The natural cyclodextrins can be used orally or topically, but natural Î²-cyclodextrin and Î³-cyclodextrin cannot be used parenterally. A number of cyclodextrin derivatives have been formulated with various usefulness in different administrative routes. Common, non-limiting examples of cyclodextrin derivatives include hydroxypropyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (e.g., 2-hydroxypropyl-Î²-cyclodextrin), hydroxypropyl-Î³-cyclodextrin (e.g., 2-hydroxypropyl-Î³-cyclodextrin), hydroxyethyl-Î²-cyclodextrin, randomly methylated Î²-cyclodextrin, methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin, dimethyl-Î²-cyclodextrin, permethylated Î²-cyclodextrin, sulfobutylether Î²-cyclodextrin (e.g., sodium salt), sulfobutyl-Î³-cyclodextrin, branched cyclodextrin (e.g., glucosyl-Î²-cyclodextrin or maltosyl-Î²-cyclodextrin, e.g., 6-O-maltosyl-Î²-cyclodextrin or glucosyl-Î²-cyclodextrin) and randomly-acetylated amorphous-Î²-cyclodextrin. Cyclodextrins may be complexed with a drug as inclusion complexes (included) in a solution in a 1:1 molar ratio, though increased or decreases relative amounts of the drug or cyclodextrin may be used during formulation in order to drive the reaction. Where the drug is aggregated instead of included within the cyclodextrin, an excess of cyclodextrin may be utilized. It should be recognized that the inclusion or aggregation process can be optimized, including manipulation of relative cyclodextrin-to-active ingredient ratios to obtain optimal solubility and bioavailability or other desirable features of the end-product.</p>

      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0080">According to another non-limiting embodiment, the formulation is a liposome or multiphase (a liquid comprising more than one phase, such as oil in water, water in oil, liposomes or multi-lamellar structures) composition. Multi-phase systems, including liposomes, are prevalent in the pharmaceutical arts. In the case of a liposome, the drug product might comprise a phospholipid, a non-ionic detergent, and a cationic lipid, such as a composition comprising a phosphatidyl choline, a non-ionic surfactant, and a quaternary ammonium salt of a lipid-substituted D or L glutamic acid or aspartic acid, and an aqueous solvent. The liposomes or multiphase liquids and the ingredients thereof are pharmaceutically acceptable. They are typically formulated using an aqueous solvent, such as water, normal saline or PBS.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0081">Phospholipids include any natural or synthetic diacylglyceryl phospholipid (such as phosphatidyl choline, phosphotidylethanolamine, phosphotidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol phosphate, etc) and phosphosphingolipid that is capable of forming self-assembling liposomes. In one example the phospholipid is a phosphatidyl choline, a compound that comprises a choline head group, glycerophosphoric acid and fatty acid. Phosphatidyl choline can be obtained from eggs, soy or any suitable source and can be synthesized.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0082">A nonionic surfactant is a surfactant containing no charged groups. Nonionic surfactants comprise a hydrophilic head group and a lipophilic tail group, such as a single- or double-lipophilic chain surfactant. Examples of lipophilic tail groups include lipophilic saturated or unsaturated alkyl groups (fatty acid groups), steroidal groups, such as cholesteryl, and vitamin E (e.g., tocopheryl) groups, such as a polysorbate (a polyoxyethylene sorbitan), for example Tween 20, 40, 60 or 80. More broadly, non-ionic surfactants include: glyceryl esters, including mono-, di- and tri-glycerides; fatty alcohols; and fatty acid esters of fatty alcohols or other alcohols, such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, sorbitan, sucrose and cholesterol.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0083">A cationic lipid is a compound having a cationic head and a lipophilic tail. Included are cationic lipids that are quaternary ammonium salts, such as quaternary ammonium salts of lipid-substituted D and L glutamic acid or aspartic acid, such as glutamic acid dialkyl amides, including for example L-glutamic acid-1, 5,-dioleyl amide. Other commercially-available examples of cationic lipids (e.g., available from Avanti Polar Lipids) include DC-Cholesterol (3Î²-[N-(Nâ²,Nâ²-dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl]cholesterol hydrochloride), DOTAP (e.g., 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (chloride salt)), DODAP (e.g., 1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylammonium-propane), DDAB (e.g., Dimethyldioctadecylammonium (Bromide Salt)), ethyl-PC (e.g., 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine (chloride salt)) and DOTMA (e.g., 1,2-di-O-octadecenyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (chloride salt)).</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0084">The ratio of ingredients (phospholipid:nonionic surfactant:cationic lipid) can vary greatly, so long as a useful multilamellar structure is obtained that is able to deliver the active agents described herein. Further, each different combination of ingredients might have different optimal ratios. The ability to determine optimal ratios does not require undue experimentation because the ability of any formulation to deliver the active agent is readily tested as described herein, and as is generally known in the pharmaceutical arts. Liposome and multilamellar structures are common delivery vehicles for active agents and their manufacture, physical testing and biological assays to determine effectiveness are well-known. Useful phospholipid:nonionic surfactant:cationic lipid ratios include, for example: from 0.1-10:0.1-10:0.1-10 (w/w), and in certain instances the nonionic surfactant:cationic lipid (w/w) ratio is approximately the same and/or the phospholipid constituent is from 2 to 10 times (w/w) that of the nonionic surfactant and cationic lipid.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Identification of PTBA as a Lead Compound</heading>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0086">A chemical screen of approximately 2000 small molecules in zebrafish embryos identified a compound that generated pericardial edema, suggesting aberrant renal development. Treatment with this compound, 4-(phenylthio)butanoic acid (PTBA), increased the size of the pronephric kidney in zebrafish. Earlier in development, PTBA expanded the expression of renal progenitor cell markers, including lhx1a, pax2a, and pax8. Blocking DNA synthesis with hydroxyurea and aphidicolin before PTBA treatment decreased its efficacy, suggesting that PTBA-mediated renal progenitor expansion is proliferation dependent. Structure-activity analysis revealed that PTBA was an analog of the known histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) 4-phenylbutanoic acid (PBA) and trichostatin A (TSA). Like PTBA, PBA and TSA both demonstrated the ability to expand lhx1a expression in treated embryos. PTBA was subsequently confirmed to function as an HDACi both in vitro and in vivo. HDACis are hypothesized to stimulate retinoic acid (RA) signaling by decreasing the concentration of RA necessary to activate RA receptors (RARs) on target genes. Indeed, treatment with PTBA affected the expression of the RA-responsive genes, cyp26a1 and cmlc2, in a manner consistent with increased RA signaling. Furthermore, blocking the RA pathway with a dominant-negative RARÎ± construct decreased PTBA efficiency. Therefore, PTBA appears to stimulate renal progenitor cell proliferation by activating the RA-signaling pathway. HDACis have been shown to improve renal recovery following acute kidney injury. Since PTBA increases renal progenitor cell proliferation, it may exert similar effects on the multipotent cells involved in regeneration. In an effort to improve PTBA efficacy for pharmacological applications, analogs were generated by modifying the key structural elements of the general HDACi pharmacophore. These were tested along with a panel of known HDACis for their ability to increase lhx1a expression in treated embryos. Several compounds were characterized that function at nanomolar concentrations and do not cause toxicity in kidney cell culture. These second generation PTBA analogs are excellent candidates for development as potential renal therapeutics.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0087">A scan was performed using an unbiased chemical library on zebrafish embryos, seeking small molecules capable of generating edemic phenotypes. Since edema may reflect renal dysfunction, it was hoped to identify compounds capable of interfering with normal pronephric development (Drummond, I. A. Kidney development and disease in the zebrafish. J Am Soc Nephrol 16, 299-304, (2005)). Determining the mechanisms of such compounds would provide insight into the molecular events guiding the specification of renal progenitor cells. Of the almost 2000 compounds tested, only four caused embryos to develop edema by the 72 hours-post fertilization (hpf) endpoint. One of these, 4-(phenylthio)butanoic acid (PTBA), demonstrated the ability to increase the expression of renal progenitor cell markers. It is hypothesized herein that PTBA increases the number of renal progenitor cells, resulting in aberrant pronephric development.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">Results</heading>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0088">PTBA Causes Edema in Zebrafish Larvae:</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0089">The initial chemical screen using a library of small molecules was performed with diverse structures. It was observed that 61 compounds (3%) were lethal and identified four compounds (NSC115787, NSC134664, NSC357777, and NSC35400, A-D in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) that generated pericardial edema in treated zebrafish larvae at 72 hpf (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>, bottom panel).</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0090">In situ hybridization determined that treatment with NSC134664, NSC357777, or NSC35400 (a disconnected structure) did not affect the size of the kidney field (data not shown). However, it was observed that treatment with various concentrations of 4-(phenylthio) butanoic acid (PTBA, NSC115787) appeared to expand the expression of some renal markers during pronephric development (data not shown). PTBA was synthesized and purified for use in all subsequent studies.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0091">PTBA Expands the Kidney Field:</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0092">To determine the concentration of PTBA that maximized efficacy, while minimizing toxicity, concentration-response experiments were performed. Treatment with 3 Î¼M PTBA caused 92% (n=88) of the embryos to develop an edemic phenotype by 72 hpf without causing significant death (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). Therefore, 3 Î¼M PTBA was chosen as the working concentration. All embryos treated with 10 Î¼M PTBA (n=90), the concentration used in the initial screen, died before 72 hpf (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). This discrepancy probably reflects the concentration variability common in small molecule libraries.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0093">The edemic phenotypes elicited by PTBA treatment prompted examination of whether the compound affects renal progenitor cells. To address this, expression patterns and relative abundance of lhx1a, pax2a, and pax8 were determined at the 10-somite stage (14 hpf). This developmental stage occurs just after specification of the first renal progenitor cells. Lhx1a expression was expanded in 95% of embryos treated with PTBA (n=60) as compared with controls (n=60) (<figref>FIGS. 4</figref>, A and B). This represented a three-fold increase in relative transcript as determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR; <figref>FIGS. 4</figref>, A and B). Increased lhx1a expression appeared in the bilateral stripes of intermediate mesoderm that give rise to the pronephros (<figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, arrowheads), as well as in the axial mesoderm (notochord; <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, asterisk).</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0094">The expression domains of pax2a and pax8 were also expanded in 95% and 97% of treated embryos, respectively, (n=60, pax2a; n=59, pax8) as compared with controls (n=60, pax2a; n=59, pax8) (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>, C through F). This accounted for an almost two-fold increase in pax2a expression and a 50% increase in pax8 expression as determined by qPCR (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>, C through F). Although these studies demonstrated that PTBA treatment resulted in increased gene expression, they did not indicate whether there are more renal progenitor cells or simply higher expression levels per cell. To differentiate between these two possibilities, the Tg(lhx1a:EGFP)<sup>pt303 </sup>reporter line (Swanhart, L. M. et al. Characterization of an lhx1a transgenic reporter in zebrafish. Int J Dev Biol 54, 731-736, (2010)) was treated with PTBA and counted the number of renal progenitor cells. As compared with control embryos, PTBA-treated embryos showed a 2.4-fold increase in the number of renal progenitor cells (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>, A through H).</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0095">PTBA is Effective During Specification:</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0096">Initiation of PTBA treatments between 2 hpf and 14 hpf (10 somites) resulted in expanded pax2a expression at 24 hpf (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>, A through F). However, beginning treatment at 16.5 hpf (15 somites) resulted in no kidney field expansion (<figref>FIG. 6G</figref>). It was later determined that initiating treatments at 15 somites or later did not affect the functional kidney as assayed by a lack of edema in 72 hpf larvae (n=90, data not shown). Thus, the effective temporal treatment window exhibited by PTBA coincides with the period when renal progenitor cells are specified.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0097">PTBA Increases Pronephric Size:</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0098">To determine whether PTBA treatment resulted in a transient or persistent expansion of the kidney field, the kidney at 48 hpf was examined using markers of glomerulus and tubule. As compared with controls (n=54), 89% of PTBA-treated embryos (n=56) displayed an expansion of the pan-tubule marker cdh17 (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>, A through D). Cross-sections from the proximal region of the cdh17 expression domain confirmed the expansion (<figref>FIGS. 7</figref>, E and F). Pronephric expansion at the protein level was also assessed by examining the expression of NaK-ATPase, another pan-tubule marker (<figref>FIGS. 8</figref>, A and B). As compared with controls (n=10), 100% of PTBA-treated embryos (n=10) exhibit expansion of NaK-ATPase protein expression. Cross-sections taken from the distal region of the NaK-ATPase expression domain show an increase in tubular diameter consistent with that observed with cdh17. (<figref>FIGS. 8</figref>, C and D, compare with <figref>FIGS. 7</figref>, E and F).</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0099">To determine if PTBA exhibits any segment-specific effects on the size of the pronephros, markers of podocytes (wt1a), proximal tubule (slc4a4), and distal tubule (sk12a1) were examined. As compared with controls (n=57, 58, and 56, respectively), PTBA-treated embryos exhibited 74% expansion of wt1a (n=50), 92% expansion of slc4a4 (n=60), and 64% expansion of sk12a1 (n=59) (<figref>FIG. 9</figref>). These results argue that PTBA treatment likely causes expansion of the entire pronephros. Furthermore, while the wt1a expression domains in control embryos have migrated to the midline by 48 hpf, the domains of PTBA-treated embryos remain separated (<figref>FIGS. 9</figref>, A and B). Since wt1a is essential for proper glomerular morphogenesis, this misexpression may contribute to a loss of kidney function. This observation could explain the edemic phenotypes associated with PTBA treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0100">PTBA does not Transform Neighboring Tissues to a Kidney Fate:</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0101">The PTBA-mediated increase in kidney field size could result from the transformation of nonrenal cells to a renal progenitor fate. To assess this possibility, the effects of PTBA on markers of two mesodermal tissues juxtaposed to renal progenitor cells was examined: myod1 (somites) and fli1a (vasculature). By in situ hybridization, it was observed that myod1 expression was slightly decreased in 95% of PTBA-treated embryos (n=60) at the 10-somite stage, as compared with controls (n=60) (<figref>FIGS. 10</figref>, A and B). However, subsequent qPCR analysis did not confirm the significance of this observed decrease (<figref>FIGS. 10</figref>, A and B). Expression of fli1a remained unchanged in 97% of PTBA-treated embryos (n=60), as compared with controls (n=59), and as assayed by qPCR (<figref>FIGS. 10</figref>, C and D).</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0102">In addition to increased lhx1a expression in renal progenitor cells, increased lhx1a expression in the notochord (<figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, asterisk) was observed. To determine whether this expansion reflected an effect on notochord size or a general increase in lhx1a expression, the notochord-specific marker ntla was assayed. It was observed that ntla was increased in 88% of PTBA treated embryos (n=60), as compared with controls (n=59) (<figref>FIGS. 10</figref>, E and F). This represented an 80% increase in ntla expression by qPCR analysis (<figref>FIGS. 10</figref>, E and F). The minimal effect on juxtaposed tissues coupled with an increase in the size of the notochord suggests that these cell types are not being converted to renal progenitor cells. Therefore, PTBA treatment cannot be definitively linked to a fate-transformation event.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0103">PTBA requires proliferation for efficacy: To examine the alternative possibility that PTBA-mediated renal progenitor cell expansion depends on cell proliferation, the efficacy of PTBA was tested in the presence of hydroxyurea and aphidicolin (HUA). HUA treatment has been previously shown to block cell division without affecting tissue specification (Harris, W. A. et al. Neuronal determination without cell division in <i>Xenopus </i>embryos. Neuron 6, 499-515, (1991)). As expected, 97% of PTBA-treated embryos (n=123) exhibited an expansion of lhx1a expression at 10 somites, as compared with controls (n=136), (<figref>FIGS. 11</figref>, A and B). HUA treatment alone did not affect lhx1a expression (<figref>FIG. 11C</figref>). However, treatment with both HUA and PTBA resulted in lhx1a expansion in only 13% of 10-somite embryos (n=104) (<figref>FIG. 11D</figref>). Furthermore, although lhx1a expression was decreased in the intermediate mesoderm, expression in the axial mesoderm still appeared to be increased in treated embryos (<figref>FIG. 11D</figref>), This result suggests that the PTBA-mediated lhx1a expansion in the axial region is proliferation independent. Since lhx1a expression in the axial mesoderm is gradually restricted to the tailbud during somitogenesis, the effect may reflect transcript perdurance.</p>

Compounds from the NCI/DTP Diversity Set I were diluted to 10 Î¼M in E3 embryo medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.33 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.33 mM MgSO4, and 0.17 mM KCl) in a final DMSO concentration of 0.5% and arrayed in 96-well plates. Beginning at approximately 2 hpf, embryos were transferred to each well in groups of five using a glass pipette. The plates were incubated at 28.5Â° C. for 70 hours. Individual wells were then scored for a dominant phenotype, representative of at least four of the five embryos. The primary objective was to identify compounds that caused edema in treated embryos at 72 hpf. Small molecules generating edema were retested once for verification, before obtaining additional compound from the NCI/DTP Open Repository.</p>

E3 medium was removed with a glass pipette and replaced with 1.5 ml treatment solutions containing 0.5% DMSO in E3 with or without compound at the reported concentrations. Treatments for all studies were initiated at 2 hpf, except for the temporal studies (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>) and the HUA studies (<figref>FIG. 11</figref>). HUA studies were performed as described previously (Zhang, L., et al. Cell cycle progression is required for zebrafish somite morphogenesis but not segmentation clock function. Development 135, 2065-2070, (2008)), with the following modifications. HUA in 0.5% DMSO was added at early gastrulation (5 hpf) and PTBA was subsequently added at late gastrulation (8 hpf) to allow for penetration of the proliferation inhibitors.

      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0119">Having established that PTBA stimulates renal progenitor cell proliferation, the mechanism responsible for this effect was then determined. Initial structure-activity relationship experiments demonstrated that certain structural motifs within PTBA modify its efficacy. While these results provided important leads for future analog development, they did not reveal any clues to the underlying mechanism. The breakthrough came when subsequent analysis revealed that PTBA is structurally similar to known histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), including 4-phenylbutanoic acid (PBA) and trichostatin A (TSA). HDACis are thought to attenuate retinoic acid receptor-mediated inhibition of target genes, lowering the threshold of retinoic acid (RA) required to activate transcription. Since RA affects pronephric development, it was hypothesized that PTBA functions as an HDACi and its effects are mediated through the RA pathway.</p>

      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0120">PTBA Structure-Activity Studies Reveal Critical Motifs:</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0121">Structure-activity analyses was performed using a series of seven analogs (<figref>FIG. 13</figref>). In situ hybridization for lhx1a was performed on 10-somite embryos treated with each analog at 3 Î¼M. The results were compared with control (no expansion, n=53) (<figref>FIG. 13A</figref>) and PTBA-treated embryos (100% expansion, n=52) (<figref>FIG. 13B</figref>). Replacement of the phenylthio ether with a phenylsulfonyl linkage stripped the compound of its effects on renal progenitor cells (no expansion, n=54) (<figref>FIG. 13C</figref>). Therefore, the oxidation state of the sulfur atom is an activity determinant. However, 4-(naphthalen-2-yl thio)butanoic acid, an analog carrying a naphthalene ring in place of the phenyl moiety of PTBA, still expands lhx1a expression to some extent (33% expansion, n=39) (<figref>FIG. 13D</figref>). Thus, modifications of the ring structure are tolerated and suggest a site for future analog development. Two analogs containing substitutions of the butanoic acid backbone, 2-amino-PTBA and 3-(phenylthio)benzoic acid had no effect on lhx1a expression (no expansion, n=64 and n=53, respectively) (<figref>FIGS. 13</figref>, E and F), suggesting a requirement for a flexible hydrocarbon backbone for biological activity. 4-phenoxybutanoic acid and 5-phenylpentanoic acid, which contain oxygen and carbon substitutions for the sulfur atom, respectively were examined. 4-Phenoxybutanoic acid exhibited reduced activity compared with the parent compound (13% expansion, n=56) (<figref>FIG. 13G</figref>), while 5-phenylpentanoic acid was inactive (no expansion, n=55) (<figref>FIG. 13H</figref>). These results suggest that compound efficacy is improved when an atom with a nonbonding electron pair(s) occupies this position. Finally, the esterified analog methyl-4-(phenylthio)butanoate exhibited equal potency to PTBA (100% expansion, n=41) (<figref>FIG. 13I</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0122">HDACis Mimic the Effects of PTBA:</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0123">Subsequent structural analysis revealed that PTBA is a close analog of 4-phenylbutanoic acid (PBA), a known HDACi (<figref>FIGS. 14</figref>, A and B), and that both compounds exhibit some similarity to the HDACi trichostatin A (TSA) (<figref>FIG. 14C</figref>). Indeed, all three structures contain the elements of the HDACi pharmacophore, a general representation of the functional domains within this class of compounds (<figref>FIG. 14D</figref>). These include an aliphatic or aromatic cap, connecting unit, hydrophobic linker, and zinc-binding group.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0124">Because PBA and TSA are structurally analogous to PTBA, it was determined whether they shared the same ability to expand renal progenitor cells. Concentration-response experiments were performed to determine the concentrations of PBA or TSA necessary to elicit lhx1a expansion, if any (<figref>FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0125">It was determined that treatment with 25 Î¼M PBA or 200 nM TSA produced an expansion of lhx1a expression consistent with that elicited by 3 Î¼M PTBA (<figref>FIGS. 15E and 16D</figref> compared with <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>). Therefore, at least two known HDACis mimic the effects of PTBA, supporting the idea that PTBA likewise functions as an HDACi.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0126">PBA and TSA Exhibit Greater Toxicity than PTBA:</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0127">How trunk mesoderm juxtaposed to the kidney field is affected by PBA and TSA treatments was then examined. PTBA treatment does not significantly affect the expression of somitic or vascular markers (<figref>FIG. 10</figref>, A through D) Furthermore, although PTBA increased ntla expression, the general structure of the notochord remained relatively unchanged (<figref>FIGS. 10</figref>, E and F). However, TSA is a broad-spectrum HDACi that causes disruption of multiple tissues in zebrafish and demonstrates renal toxicity in cell culture. Therefore, embryos were treated with 25 Î¼M PBA or 200 nM TSA and the expression of myod1, fli1a, and ntla was compared with that of control embryos. Expression of myod1 was decreased in 57% of PBA-treated embryos (n=53) and 100% of TSA-treated embryos, as compared to controls (n=54) (<figref>FIG. 17</figref>, A through C). Furthermore, TSA treatment caused an almost complete loss of the somitic blocks (<figref>FIG. 17C</figref>). As compared with controls (n=54), fli1a expression decreased in 78% of PBA-treated embryos (n=54) and 95% of TSA-treated embryos (n=55) (<figref>FIG. 17</figref>, D through F). PBA increased ntla expression in 87% of treated embryos (n=52), as compared to controls (n=55) (<figref>FIGS. 17</figref>, G and H). This effect appears similar to the expanded ntla expression observed following PTBA treatment (<figref>FIG. 10F</figref>). In contrast, TSA disrupted normal ntla expression in 86% of treated embryos (n=56), as compared with controls (<figref>FIGS. 17</figref>, G and I). This resulted in breaks in the ntla expression pattern (<figref>FIG. 17I</figref>, arrowheads).</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0128">To determine the toxicity of PBA and TSA relative to PTBA, phenotypic concentration-response experiments were again performed. 72 hpf larvae were assessed for the development of edemic phenotypes over the same concentration range used to test for expansion of the kidney field. Pericardial edema was evident in 23% of larvae treated with 25 Î¼M PBA (n=83) and 100% of larvae treated with 200 nM TSA (n=35) (<figref>FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>). In addition, 25 Î¼M PBA caused minimal, but significant death (8%, n=90), while treatment with 200 nM TSA resulted in high lethality (61%, n=90) (<figref>FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0129">PTBA Functions as an HDACi In Vitro:</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0130">Because PBA and TSA mimic the ability of PTBA to expand renal progenitor cells, it was determined whether PTBA functions as an HDACi. To evaluate this in vitro, the deacetylation of a fluorescent peptide substrate was measured in the presence of human HDACs. HDAC activity increased in direct proportion to the amount of HeLa cell nuclear extract added to the assay (<figref>FIG. 20</figref>, black triangle). Addition of TSA completely blocked activity at all input levels of nuclear extract (<figref>FIG. 20</figref>, gray triangle). Previous work showed that 5 mM PBA decreased HDAC activity in DSI9 mouse erythroleukemia cells to 19% of the control value (Lea, M. A. &amp; Tulsyan, N. Discordant effects of butyrate analogues on erythroleukemia cell proliferation, differentiation and histone deacetylase. Anticancer Res 15, 879-883, (1995)). To determine whether PTBA inhibited HDACs to a similar extent as PBA, both compounds were evaluated at 5 mM. PTBA and PBA showed similar potency, reducing the HDAC activity elicited by 10 Î¼g HeLa extract to 30% of the control value (<figref>FIG. 20</figref>, diamond and circle, respectively). Previously, the PTBA analog, 4-(phenylsulfonyl)butanoic acid (PSOBA), demonstrated no ability to expand renal progenitor cells (<figref>FIG. 13C</figref>). Therefore, it was hypothesized that it would function poorly in vitro as an HDACi. As expected, 5 mM PSOBA decreased the HDAC activity elicited by 10 Î¼g HeLa extract to only 70% of the control value (<figref>FIG. 20</figref>, square).</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0131">PTBA Functions as an HDACi In Vivo:</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0132">It was next determined whether the HDACi function of PTBA was quantifiable in vivo. 24 hpf embryos were treated with 3 Î¼M PTBA, 25 Î¼M PBA, or 200 nM TSA for 6 hours. Protein extracts were prepared and immunoblotted with an anti-hyperacetylated histone H4 antibody. Histone H4 hyperacetylation was observed following treatment with all three compounds at their tested concentrations, as compared with the control (<figref>FIG. 21</figref>). Furthermore, increasing the compound concentration caused a corresponding increase in hyperacetylation (<figref>FIG. 21</figref>). Therefore, both in vitro and in vivo results confirm that PTBA functions as an HDACi.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0133">PTBA Affects Retinoic Acid Signaling:</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0134">HDACis are believed to lower the threshold of RA necessary to activate transcription. If PTBA treatment facilitates activation of the RA pathway, then expression of genes responsive to RA signaling should change. Consequently, two genes were focused on: cyp26a1, which is directly activated by RA signaling, and the cardiac gene cmlc2, whose expression in the heart field size is reduced by RA treatments. In a previous study, cmlc2 expression was assessed for RAdependent effects in 18-somite embryos (Keegan, B. R., Feldman, J. L., Begemann, G., Ingham, P. W. &amp; Yelon, D. Retinoic acid signaling restricts the cardiac progenitor pool. Science 307, 247-249, (2005)), therefore embryos were collected at the 18-somite stage for continuity. As compared to controls (n=58), expression of cyp26a1 was increased in 100% of PTBA-treated embryos (n=57) (<figref>FIGS. 22</figref>, A and B). In agreement with this result, cmlc2 expression was decreased in 100% of PTBA-treated embryos (n=58), as compared to controls (n=57) (<figref>FIGS. 22</figref>, C and D).</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0135">To provide a stronger link between PTBA treatment and RA signaling, mRNA encoding a dominant-negative RARÎ± construct (DN-RARÎ±), which is known to block RA signaling (Blumberg, B. et al. An essential role for retinoid signaling in anteroposterior neural patterning. Development 124, 373-379, (1997)), was injected prior to PTBA treatment. In situ hybridization was performed to determine the maximum amount of DN-RARÎ± mRNA that could be injected at the one-cell stage without affecting lhx1a expression. In the tested range of 0 to 400 ng, embryos injected with 200 ng DNRARÎ± mRNA or less showed normal lhx1a expression, while higher doses caused aberrant or decreased expression (data not shown). Therefore, 200 ng DN-RARÎ± mRNA was injected to assess the relationship between PTBA and the RA pathway. As compared with controls (n=80), an expansion of lhx1a expression was observed in 90% of the mock-injected PTBA-treated embryos at the 10-somite stage (n=78) (<figref>FIGS. 23</figref>, A and B). Expression of lhx1a appeared normal in 92% of embryos injected with 200 pg DN-RARÎ± mRNA (n=125) (<figref>FIG. 23C</figref>). However, only 19% of the embryos injected with 200 pg DN-RARÎ± mRNA and subsequently treated with PTBA showed expanded lhx1a expression (n=125) (<figref>FIG. 23D</figref>). Therefore, these data suggest that PTBA-mediated expansion of renal progenitor cells is dependent on the retinoic acid pathway.</p>

      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0145">Determining that treating zebrafish embryos with PTBA, a novel HDACi, increased the number of renal progenitor cells leading to a corresponding increase in pronephric size suggested that these cells are capable of contributing to nephrogenesis. As early as 1989, Bacallo and Fine proposed that kidney regeneration follows the same pattern of differentiation events that lead to nephrogenesis (Molecular events in the organization of renal tubular epithelium: from nephrogenesis to regeneration. Am J Physiol 257, F913-924, (1989)). Both processes begin with the proliferation of renal progenitor cells to provide the raw material necessary for subsequent differentiation into kidney tissue. Since PTBA stimulates renal progenitor cell proliferation during pronephric development, it may function similarly during kidney regeneration. However, developing PTBA into a potential therapeutic requires the consideration of both its efficacy and toxicity. Furthermore, expanding the structure-activity relationship study to a wider selection of small molecules may yield better candidates for future in vivo studies. Therefore, a panel of structural and functional analogs of PTBA was evaluated to identify compounds exhibiting nanomolar efficacy and low toxicity in kidney cell culture. It was hypothesized that modifying the key structural elements that determine the HDACi activity of PTBA would improve its ability to expand renal progenitor cells.</p>

      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0146">Phenotypic Screening of PTBA Analogs:</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0147">As shown above, treating zebrafish embryos with 3 Î¼M PTBA generates pericardial edema by 72 hpf (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). This PTBA concentration also stimulates the proliferation of renal progenitor cells during pronephric development (<figref>FIGS. 5 and 11</figref>). Furthermore, by 48 hpf, embryos treated with 3 Î¼M PTBA exhibit wider pronephric tubules and a failure of wt1a convergence at the dorsal midline (<figref>FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b>) Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the edemic phenotype reflects aberrant kidney morphogenesis resulting from an overabundance of renal progenitor cells. Consequently, a phenotypic screen was performed on a panel of PTBA analogs at 3 Î¼M to identify potentially effective compounds. Each of the compounds chosen for analysis represents either a structural or functional analog of the lead compound, PTBA. The structural analogs contain functional group additions or substitutions in one of four elements of the PTBA structure (See <figref>FIG. 24</figref>). These modify the key determinants of HDACi activity as predicted by the general pharmacophore: the aliphatic cap, connecting unit, hydrophobic linker, and zinc-binding group (<figref>FIGS. 14D and 24</figref>). The structural analogs selected for the panel each contain one or more of these modifications. For example, the aliphatic cap (W) may be H, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>, OCH<sub>3</sub>, F, Cl, or Br; the connecting unit (X) may be S, SO<sub>2</sub>, O, NH, or CH<sub>2</sub>; the fatty acid linker (Y) is CH<sub>2</sub>; and the Zinc-binding group (Z) may be OH, OCH<sub>3</sub>, O(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, OCH(CH<sub>3</sub>)CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, OC(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, or NHOH. Several functional group choices were based on previous structure-activity relationship studies of PTBA. For example, methylating the zinc-binding group of PTBA generated a compound equally capable of expanding lhx1a expression in treated embryos (<figref>FIG. 13I</figref>). Therefore, the efficacy of several alkylated analogs was assessed.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0148">In addition, it was observed that the hydroxamic acid HDACi, trichostatin A (TSA), exhibited high efficacy, increasing lhx1a expression at 200 nM. (<figref>FIG. 16D</figref>). Hydroxamic acids, which form two coordinate bonds with the active site zinc, are generally stronger than carboxylic acids, including PTBA, which form only one (Jacobsen, F. E., Lewis, J. A. &amp; Cohen, S. M. The design of inhibitors for medicinally relevant metalloproteins. ChemMedChem 2, 152-171, (2007)). Thus, several of the analogs tested contained hydroxamate moieties on the zinc-binding group. Ten functional analogs were also chosen to represent a subset of known HDACis of several different classes (<figref>FIG. 25</figref> and Table 2). These include inhibitors derived from carboxylic acids, hydroxamic acids, benzamides, and natural products (Villar-Garea, A. &amp; Esteller, M. Histone deacetylase inhibitors: understanding a new wave of anticancer agents. Int J Cancer 112, 171-178, (2004)). With the exception of butanoic acid, all of the chosen compounds, listed in Table 2, have predicted octanol-water partition coefficients (LogPs) greater than 1.</p>

The 32 compounds and a DMSO control were examined for their ability to generate pericardial edema in zebrafish larvae by 72 hpf. Treatment with 12 compounds did not cause a statistically-significant decrease in the number of wild-type larval phenotypes, as compared with controls. This group included the four compounds containing connecting unit substitutions, seven of the known HDACis, and one alkylated analog, tert-butyl 4-(phenylthio)butanoate. Treatment with each of the remaining analogs generated edemic and/or lethal phenotypes that were scored using the phenotype-based classification system described above. Three of these compounds, TSA, valproic acid, and apicidin, are known HDAC inhibitors. The lethality of 3 Î¼M TSA was expected, since it was previously demonstrated that 300 nM TSA killed greater than 90% of treated 72 hpf larvae (<figref>FIG. 19</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0150">Compounds listed in Table 2 below tert-butyl 4-(phenylthio)butanoate exhibit a significant decrease (p&lt;0.05) in the occurrence of wild-type phenotypes as determined by Fisher's exact test.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0151">Furthermore, with the exception of apicidin, all of the compounds that cause more severe phenotypes than PTBA contain either hydroxamic or alkylated zinc-binding groups. Taken together, these results suggest that modifications of PTBA anticipated to alter its underlying HDACi function may affect compound efficacy during pronephric development. However, pericardial edema can develop as a result of organ dysfunction unrelated to the kidney. Therefore, the effect of each of these compounds, if any, on renal progenitor cells was determined. To accomplish this, lhx1a expression was examined in treated embryos at the 10-somite stage. In situ hybridizations was performed on embryos treated with decreasing concentrations of compound, beginning at 3 Î¼M (Table 2). The results were categorized relative to the efficacy of PTBA at a given concentration and are detailed below.</p>

      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0152">PTBA Analog Efficacy in Renal Progenitor Cells at 3 Î¼M:</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0153">Of the 12 compounds that exhibited no significant effect on larval phenotype, 10 compounds did not expand lhx1a expression as compared with controls (no expansion, n=36) (Table 2). This group includes HDACis, such as SAHA and tubacin, which exhibit similar potency to TSA in vitro (Bradner, J. E. et al. Chemical phylogenetics of histone deacetylases. Nat Chem Biol 6, 238-243, (2010)). However, treatment with 3 Î¼M Scriptaid or tert-butyl 4-(phenylthio)butanoate increased lhx1a expression in 39% and 25% of the tested embryos (n=36 each), respectively, as compared with controls (no expansion, n=36) (<figref>FIGS. 26</figref>, A, C, and E). Therefore, the failure to develop pericardial edema following treatment is a predictive, but not absolute, indicator of an ineffective analog.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0154">Lhx1a expression analysis separated the 20 compounds, including PTBA, which caused edemic or lethal phenotypes into four groups. The first group, consisting of 4-(napthalen-2-ylthio)butanoic acid and 3-(phenylthio) benzoic acid, caused no expansion of lhx1a in the treated embryos. Therefore, their edemic phenotypes probably result from non-kidney related effects during embryonic development. The second group, consisting of three compounds, expanded lhx1a expression in less than 75% of the treated embryos in comparison to controls (<figref>FIG. 26A</figref>). This group included valproic acid, a known HDACi, (20% expansion, n=35), N-hydroxy-4-[(4-methoxyphenyl)thio]butanamide (31% expansion, n=35), and methyl 4-[(bromophenyl)thio]butanoate (74% expansion, n=35) (<figref>FIGS. 26</figref>, B, D, and F). The third group consisted of 12 effective compounds, including PTBA, which expanded lhx1a expression in greater than 90% of the treated embryos as compared with controls. The eleven PTBA analogs all contained either hydroxamic or alkylated zinc-binding groups. Compounds with these structural motifs also caused the most edema and lethality in the phenotypic screen (Table 2). Furthermore, all compounds showing greater than 90% efficacy by in situ hybridization demonstrate phenotypic effects similar to or more severe than those caused by PTBA. Therefore, the severity of edemic phenotypes does appear to correlate with the ability of a given PTBA analog to expand renal progenitor cells with some exceptions as previously noted. These compounds were subsequently tested to determine their efficacies at sequentially lower concentrations. The final group, consisting of methyl 4-[(4-fluorophenyl)thio)]butanoate, apicidin, and trichostatin A, killed all treated embryos before they reached the 10-somite stage. Toxicity of these compounds at 3 Î¼M does not preclude them from expanding renal progenitor cells at lower concentrations. Indeed, treating embryos with 200 nM TSA expands lhx1a expression in a manner similar to 3 Î¼M PTBA (<figref>FIG. 16D</figref> compared with <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>). Therefore, the efficacy of these compounds at concentrations below 3 Î¼M was assessed along with the previous group.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0155">PTBA analog efficacy in renal progenitor cells at 1.5 Î¼M: Two compounds, apicidin and TSA, were lethal at 1.5 Î¼M, while 13 others demonstrated some ability to expand lhx1a expression in 10-somite embryos. Two of these were partially effective, expanding less than 75% of the treated embryos when compared with controls (no expansion, n=36) (<figref>FIG. 27A</figref>). These were 4-[(bromophenyl)thio]-N-hydroxybutanamide (47% expansion, n=36) and methyl 4-[(4-chlorophenyl)thio]butanoate (72% expansion, n=36) (<figref>FIGS. 27</figref>, B and C). Because they lacked the efficacy of the remaining analogs, these compounds were not evaluated further. Eleven compounds, including PTBA (83% expansion, n=35) (<figref>FIG. 27D</figref>), showed efficacy in greater than 80% of the treated embryos. Four contained hydroxamic zinc-binding groups, with three of these also carrying a substituted aliphatic cap: N-hydroxy-4-(phenylthio)butanamide (92% expansion, n=36), N-hydroxy-4-[(4-methylphenyl)thio]butanamide (97% expansion, n=33), 4-[(4-chlorophenyl)thio]-N-hydroxybutanamide (97% expansion, n=36), and 4-[(4-fluorophenyl)thio]-N-hydroxybutanamide (100% expansion, n=36) (<figref>FIG. 27</figref>, E through H).</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0156">Four analogs had methylated zinc-binding groups, with three of these also including aliphatic cap substitutions: methyl-4-(phenylthio)butanoate (89% expansion, n=36), methyl 4-[(4-methoxyphenyl)thio]butanoate (91% expansion, n=35), methyl 4-[(4-methylphenyl)thio]butanoate (100% expansion, n=36), and methyl 4-[(4-fluorophenyl)thio]butanoate (100% expansion, n=30) (<figref>FIG. 27</figref>, I through L). The remaining two analogs demonstrating over 80% efficacy carried propyl- and sec-butyl substitutions, respectively, on their zinc-binding groups: propyl 4-(phenylthio)butanoate (89% expansion, n=36) and butan-2-yl 4-(phenylthio)butanoate (89% expansion, n=35) (<figref>FIGS. 27</figref>, M and N). Because each of these 10 PTBA analogs exhibited efficacy above that of PTBA, these data support the approach of targeting motifs important in HDACi activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0157">PTBA Analog Efficacy on Renal Progenitor Cells at 800 nM:</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0158">Treatments at 800 nM revealed two distinct groups of analogs based on efficacy. The partially effective compounds, consisting of PTBA and five analogs, expanded lhx1a expression in less than 25% of treated 10-somite embryos as compared with controls. With the exception of 4-[(4-chlorophenyl)thio]-N-hydroxybutanamide, none of these compounds carried a substituted aliphatic cap. Because of their already limited efficacy at 800 nM, these compounds were not tested at lower concentrations. The five members of the more effective second group increased lhx1a expression in greater than 45% of treated embryos as compared with controls (no expansion, n=36) (<figref>FIG. 28A</figref>). This group of analogs included methyl 4-[(methylphenyl)thio]butanoate (49% expansion, n=35), methyl 4-[(methoxyphenyl)thio]butanoate (57% expansion, n=35), 4-[(4-fluorophenyl)thio]-N-hydroxybutanamide (60% expansion, n=35), N-hydroxy-4[(methylphenyl)thio]butanamide (61% expansion, n=36) and methyl 4-[(4-fluorophenyl)thio]butanoate (64% expansion, n=36) (<figref>FIG. 28</figref>, B through F).</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0159">Each of these compounds contained substitutions in both the zinc-binding group and aliphatic cap. These substitutions represented only a limited selection of functional groups. The zincbinding groups contained either hydroxamic acids or methylated carboxylic acids, while the aliphatic caps carried either methyl-, methoxy-, or fluoro-substitutions. These results suggest that certain structural motifs impart improved efficacy to the PTBA backbone.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0160">Treatment with 800 nM apicidin killed 69% of the treated embryos (n=36). Surviving embryos exhibited general toxicity that precluded the scoring of lhx1a expansion (data not shown). TSA treatment at 800 nM was lethal. The five analogs exhibiting greater than 45% efficacy, apicidin, and TSA were retested at 400 nM.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0161">PTBA Analog Efficacy on Renal Progenitor Cells at 400 nM or Below:</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0162">Three of the five remaining structural analogs of PTBA and apicidin exhibited a partial ability to expand lhx1a expression at 400 nM in comparison to controls (n=35) (<figref>FIG. 29A</figref>). Of these, 400 nM 4-[(4-fluorophenyl)thio]-N-hydroxybutanamide expanded 35% of treated embryos (n=34), the highest percentage of any tested PTBA structural analog at this concentration (<figref>FIG. 29B</figref>). Two others, methyl 4-[(methoxyphenyl)thio]butanoate (29% expansion, n=35) (<figref>FIG. 29C</figref>) and methyl 4-[(4-fluorophenyl)thio]butanoate (26% expansion, n=35), increased lhx1a expression in over 25% of treated embryos. Furthermore, methyl 4-[(4-fluorophenyl)thio]butanoate also caused partial lhx1a expansion at 200 nM (22% expansion, n=32) (<figref>FIG. 29D</figref>), while the other two structural analogs were ineffective. This represents the lowest observed concentration of a structural PTBA analog capable of expanding renal progenitor cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0163">Treatment with 400 nM apicidin expanded 22% of treated embryos (n=36) (<figref>FIG. 29E</figref>), but was ineffective at 200 nM. All embryos treated with 400 nM trichostatin A died before reaching 10 somites. However, treatment with 200 nM TSA caused lhx1a expansion in 100% of treated embryos as compared with controls (n=29). This observation is in agreement with my previous results (<figref>FIG. 16D</figref>). Treatment with 100 nM TSA was also effective (97% expansion, n=35), marking the lowest tested concentration of any PTBA analog, structural or functional, affecting renal progenitor cells (<figref>FIG. 29F</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0164">Toxicity Assays:</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0165">The cytotoxicity of the 15 compounds exhibiting efficacy or lethality at 3 Î¼M was tested in a conditionally-immortalized mouse podocyte cell line. Podocytes are polarized epithelial cells located on the glomerular basement membrane that contribute to the integrity of the filtration barrier. For the purposes of these experiments, they function as an indicator of renal toxicity. Following 72 hours of treatment with each compound concentrations ranging from 30 Î¼M to 3 nM, podocyte viability was assessed by measuring residual metabolic activity (<figref>FIG. 30</figref>). From these data, the concentration where 50% of the exposed podocytes remained viable (E<sub>50</sub>) was calculated. Of the 15 analogs tested, only two, TSA and apicidin, caused sufficient cytotoxicity to allow the calculation of an E50 value. Over the course of three experiments, TSA exhibited a mean E<sub>50 </sub>of 96 nM (s=51 nM), while the mean E<sub>50 </sub>for apicidin was 152 nM (s=54 nM). Treatment with PTBA or each of 12 structural analogs never decreased podocyte viability below the 50% threshold, even when tested at 30 Î¼M (<figref>FIG. 30</figref>). In fact, over three experiments, podocyte viability never dropped 75 below 80% following treatment with any of these compounds. Therefore PTBA analogs, carrying cap and/or zinc-binding group modifications, do not increase the toxicity of the compound relative to PTBA. These results suggest that the efficacy of PTBA can be improved through analog development without causing a corresponding increase in compound toxicity.</p>

      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0168">PTBA and methyl-4-(phenylthio)butanoate were synthesized as described above. 4-(Naphthalen-2-ylthio)butanoic acid (NSC2733) and 3-(phenylthio)benzoic acid (NSC113994), were obtained from the NCI/DTP Open Repository. APHA compound 8, Apicidin, butanoic acid, PBA, 4-phenoxybutanoic acid, 5-phenylpentanoic acid, Scriptaid, TSA, and valproic acid were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. MS-275 and SAHA were obtained from Cayman Chemical Co. 4-(phenylsulfonyl)butanoic acid was obtained from Matrix Scientific. Tubacin was a gift of Dr. Ralph Mazitschek of the Broad Institute (Cambridge, Mass.). The remaining PTBA analogs were synthesized. Three independent groups of 12 chorionated 2 hpf embryos were arrayed in individual wells of 24-well plates. E3 medium was removed with a glass pipette and replaced with 800 Î¼l treatment solutions containing 0.5% DMSO in E3 with or without compound at the reported concentrations.</p>

      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0174">The isolation and characterization of conditionally-immortalized mouse podocyte cell line have been previously described (Mundel, P. et al. Rearrangements of the cytoskeleton and cell contacts induce process formation during differentiation of conditionally immortalized mouse podocyte cell lines. <i>Exp Cell Res </i>236, 248-258, (1997) and Schwartz, E. J. et al. Human immunodeficiency virus-1 induces loss of contact inhibition in podocytes. <i>J Am Soc Nephrol </i>12, 1677-1684, (2001)). Mouse podocytes were plated at a density of 6,000 cells per 200 Î¼l in 96-well plates to elicit log-phase growth. The indicated PTBA analogs were added at 30 Î¼M, 10 Î¼M, 1 Î¼M, 300 nM, 100 nM, 30 nM, or 3 nM and incubated at 33Â° C. for 72 hours. The final DMSO concentration was maintained at 0.2% in all treatments except 30 Î¼M (0.6%). After incubation, cytotoxicity was analyzed using the Cell Titer-Blue Cell Viability Assay (Promega) per manufacturer's instructions. Reagent (20 Î¼l) was added to 100 Î¼l of cells and plates were incubated for 2 hours at 37Â° C. Fluorescence was read at 79 560Ex/590Em on a Gemini SpectramaxXS (Molecular Devices) plate reader. Viability was calculated as a percentage of the DMSO control, which was considered 100% viability. Data represent the results of three independent experiments using duplicate wells for each condition. E50 values were determined from the transformed and normalized data by non-linear regression.</p>
      <heading id="h-00017-en" level="2">Discussion.</heading>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0175">From a screen of almost 2000 small molecules, we identified a compound, PTBA, which had not been previously reported as a âhitâ in 136 previous chemical library screens (NCBIâPubChem). The success of our screen validates the use of an edemic phenotype as an indicator of aberrant kidney development. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of sound experimental design in determining the desired outcome. Many factors should be considered before beginning to interrogate libraries containing thousands of small molecules. Indeed, depending on the predetermined goals and parameters of the screen, investigators can generate completely different data sets using the same compound library. To illustrate this point, chemical screens performed by two labs (de Groh, E. D. et al Inhibition of histone deacetylase expands the renal progenitor cell population. J Am Soc Nephrol 21, 794-802, (2010) and Molina, G. et al. Zebrafish chemical screening reveals an inhibitor of Dusp6 that expands cardiac cell lineages. Nat Chem Biol 5, 680-687, (2009)). Both groups tested zebrafish embryos at 10 Î¼M using NCI/DTP Diversity Set compounds drawn from daughter plates derived from the same DMSO stocks. Furthermore, each lab identified a compound, PTBA or BCI, which expanded progenitor cells, leading to increased kidney or heart size, respectively. However, the differing experimental approaches utilized by the two groups masked the effects of the other small molecule. BCI was identified by treating transgenic embryos carrying a fluorescent FGFsignaling reporter from 24 to 32 hpf. Since PTBA loses efficacy at about 15 hpf and edema typically does not develop until at least 48 hpf, PTBA-treated embryos would appear wild-type. Therefore, even if they had recorded interesting secondary phenotypes beyond those involved in FGF signaling, PTBA would have been missed using that approach. Likewise, BCI-treated 72 hpf larvae were scored as wild-type in our phenotypic screen, even though they almost certainly contained enlarged hearts. Although both screens were ultimately successful, their unique observations depended on the selection of treatment windows and phenotypes appropriate for the research. Without these considerations, the effects of interesting small molecules can be easily overlooked.</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0176">Another important factor contributing to the discovery of PTBA was the concentration chosen for the screen. In this, we were very fortunate. All compounds were ostensibly tested at 10 Î¼M in embryo medium. Had this truly been the case, the data suggest that PTBA treatment would have killed all the embryos before reaching 72 hpf. Since we performed no further characterization on compounds found to be lethal at the screening concentration, PTBA might never have been characterized. Luckily, compound concentrations in DMSO stocks can vary several fold from the reported value in small molecule libraries (Popa-Burke, I. G. et al. Streamlined system for purifying and quantifying a diverse library of compounds and the effect of compound concentration measurements on the accurate interpretation of biological assay results. Anal Chem 76, 7278-7287, (2004)). Thus, the concentration in the PTBA-containing well was probably much closer to 3-5 Î¼M, allowing edema formation and generating a positive hit. Furthermore, had we decided to screen at a lower concentration, the larvae may have appeared wild-type, again precluding any further testing. This exposes a flaw in the way many small molecule screens are performed: very few involve screening at multiple concentrations. It could be argued that repeated screening of a library is a waste of time and effort, especially if hits have been identified. However, small molecule libraries generally already represent a significant investment of resources, and follow-up screens at different concentrations merit consideration. At the very least, compounds observed to be lethal in the initial screen could be retested at lower concentrations in search of relevant phenotypes.</p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0177">Treating zebrafish embryos with PTBA stimulates RA signaling, as evidenced by its effects on the RA-responsive genes cyp26a1 and cmlc2. Consequently, blocking RA signaling at the receptor level with dominant-negative RARÎ± greatly reduced PTBA efficacy. Therefore, PTBA likely interacts with some elements of the RA signaling pathway in order to stimulate renal progenitor cell proliferation during pronephric development. The characterization of PTBA as a novel HDACi suggests that the targets are most likely the HDACs controlling the repression of RA-responsive genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0178">In the absence of RA, an RAR/RXR dimer binds the RARE in regulated promoters and recruits complexes of corepressor proteins, including an HDAC (<figref>FIG. 31A</figref>). The HDAC deacetylates nearby nucleosomes, causing chromatin condensation which inhibits gene transcription. When RA binds the RAR/RXR dimer, it elicits a conformational change that removes the HDAC from close proximity to the nucleosomes (<figref>FIG. 31B</figref>). This facilitates the activity of coactivators, such as histone acetyltransferases, which decondense the chromatin and allow transcription to occur. By inhibiting the corepressor HDAC, HDACis have been hypothesized to lower the RA concentration necessary to activate the RAR/RXR dimer (<figref>FIG. 31C</figref>). In this way, PTBA could stimulate RA signaling at the receptor level without affecting the endogenous RA concentration.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0179">The downstream target of RA-signaling that mediates the effects of PTBA on renal progenitor cells remains unknown. Since my results argue that PTBA treatment stimulates renal progenitor cell proliferation without significantly transforming juxtaposed tissues, the effect is probably local. Therefore, PTBA may enhance RA signaling directly within renal progenitor cells, leading to increased proliferation. Because attenuation does not require the synthesis of protein intermediates, this hypothesis is compatible with the previous work of Cartry and coworkers (Cartry, J. et al. Retinoic acid signalling is required for specification of pronephric cell fate. Dev Biol 299, 35-51, (2006)). They observed that treating <i>Xenopus </i>embryos with RA caused lhx1a expansion even in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Furthermore, treating kidney epithelial cell lines with RA increased both thymidine uptake and the proportion of cells in S-phase (Anderson, R. J., et al. Retinoic acid regulation of renal tubular epithelial and vascular smooth muscle cell function. J Am Soc Nephrol 9, 773-781, (1998) and Argiles, A., et al. Retinoic acid affects the cell cycle and increases total protein content in epithelial cells. Kidney Int 36, 954-959, (1989)). Therefore, it is possible that the proliferative machinery in renal progenitor cells may respond to RA-signaling in a similar manner.</p>

      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0181">In many respects, the process of kidney regeneration mimics that of nephrogenesis. In both cases, a multipotent cell first proliferates to provide the necessary raw material and then differentiates into the required tissue type. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the source of the multipotent cells involved in regeneration. The first, and most generally accepted, suggests that these cells arise from tissue dedifferentiation near the site of damage. Other groups argue that the multipotent cells are actually stem cells of intrarenal or extrarenal origin. In any case, it is reasonable to assume that these cells share elements in common with renal progenitor cells. Therefore, it was hypothesized that they may also exhibit similar proliferation in response to PTBA treatment. This hypothesis may explain the observations made by other groups regarding the relationship between HDAC inhibition and renal regeneration. In one study, Imai and coworkers demonstrated that treating mice with daily injections of TSA attenuated renal damage following injury (Imai, N. et al. Inhibition of histone deacetylase activates side population cells in kidney and partially reverses chronic renal injury. Stem Cells 25, 2469-2475, (2007)). Since PTBA and TSA both function as HDACis and expand renal progenitor cells, they may also act similarly in facilitating renal regeneration. In another study, Marumo and coworkers demonstrated that the expression of Hdac5 was significantly decreased following acute ischemic damage in mouse kidneys (Marumo, T., et al. Epigenetic regulation of BMP7 in the regenerative response to ischemia. J Am Soc Nephrol 19, 1311-1320, (2008)). This suggests that the reduction of HDAC activity may serve as an important part of the regeneration process. Therefore, at least some evidence supports the idea that PTBA may function as a useful therapeutic following acute kidney injury.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0182">To test this hypothesis, we used a transgenic mouse model of acute kidney injury using diphtheria toxin (DT) as a nephrotoxic agent. Unlike humans, mice are normally resistant to DT exposure. This resistance arises from several amino acid differences in the protein acting as the DT receptor, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (Hbegf) (Mitamura, T., et al. Diphtheria toxin binds to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain of human heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor/diphtheria toxin receptor and inhibits specifically its mitogenic activity. J Biol Chem 270, 1015-1019, (1995)). Transgenic mice (PTC-DTR) express human HBEGF in their proximal tubules, creating the conditions for an acute and specific damage event. Since blood is a buffered solution, testing PTBA would have been a poor choice. At neutral pH, the zinc-binding group would be deprotonated and the resulting polar charge would greatly decrease its absorption through cell membranes. Instead we tested an effective structural analog carrying a methylated zinc-binding group, methyl 4-(phenylthio)butanoate (MPTB). PTC-DTR mice were injected with DT and damage was allowed to accrue for one day. At this time, mice were given daily injections of MPTB or a DMSO control for the next six days. Preliminary data from a single group of mice suggest that MPTB treatment significantly increases the rate of renal recovery by approximately 30% (<figref>FIG. 32</figref>). Therefore, PTBA analogs demonstrate some promise as renal therapeutics following acute kidney injury (Cianciolo Cosentino C. et al., Histone deacetylase inhibitor enhances recovery after AKI, J Am Soc Nephrol. 2013 May; 24(6), 943-53 and Skrypnyk N. I. et al., Ischemia-reperfusion Model of Acute Kidney Injury and Post Injury Fibrosis in Mice, J Vis Exp. 2013 Aug. 9; (78)).</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0183">Toxicity is also an important consideration during the development of any drug. At its effective concentration, PTBA exhibited much milder effects on juxtaposed mesodermal tissues in comparison to TSA. Furthermore, structural PTBA analogs, even when administered at 30 demonstrated little effect on podocyte cell viability in cell culture assays. However, the data above suggests that treating podocytes with 100 nM TSA would be expected to kill at least 50% of the cells within 72 hours. There are at least two possible explanations for this difference in toxicity, each reflecting different considerations of HDAC-HDACi binding. Crystallography studies have revealed how several HDACis block substrate access by interacting with the Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the catalytic site of an HDAC. Therefore, most HDACis, including carboxylic and hydroxamic acids, function as competitive inhibitors of HDACs. In general, hydroxamic HDACis bind HDACs much more strongly than HDACis containing carboxylic acid zinc-binding groups, such as PTBA (Jacobsen, F. E., et al. ChemMedChem 2, 152-171, (2007)). This is because PTBA should form only one coordinate bond with the active site zinc, an arrangement known as monodentate binding. In contrast, the hydroxamic acid of TSA binds in a bidentate fashion, forming two coordinate bonds with the active site zinc. This difference is reflected in the results of our in vitro HDAC analysis. TSA is observed to inhibit all HDAC activity at micromolar concentrations, while PTBA reduced HDAC activity by only 70% at millimolar concentrations. However, this large efficacy difference is not evident in vivo. PTBA and TSA were found to generate similar increases in histone hyperacetylation at concentrations within about one log of each other. These data suggest that additional factors may be involved in determining compound efficacy in the context of a whole organism.</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0184">The difference in HDAC isoform specificity between carboxylic and hydroxamic acids may provide a possible explanation for these observations. HDAC isoforms are separated into four classes based on their size, homology, cellular localization, and catalytic activity (<figref>FIG. 33</figref>). For example, Class I isoforms generally exhibit nuclear localization, while Class II HDACs are primarily cytoplasmic (Balasubramanian, S., et al. Isoform-specific histone deacetylase inhibitors: the next step? Cancer Lett 280, 211-221, (2009)). Carboxylic acid HDACis are considered to be specific inhibitors of Class I and IIa HDACs, while hydroxamic acids target Class I, II, and IV isoforms (<figref>FIG. 33</figref>, Bieliauskas, A. V. et al. Isoform-selective histone deacetylase inhibitors. Chem Soc Rev 37, 1402-1413, (2008); Bolden, J. E., et al. Anticancer activities of histone deacetylase inhibitors. Nat Rev Drug Discov 5, 769-784, (2006); Butler, K. V. et al. Chemical origins of isoform selectivity in histone deacetylase inhibitors. Curr Pharm Des 14, 505-528, (2008); and Khan, N. et al. Determination of the class and isoform selectivity of small-molecule histone deacetylase inhibitors. Biochem J 409, 581-589, (2008)). Meanwhile, the Class III HDACs (sirtuins), utilize an NAD+-dependent catalysis mechanism that remains unaffected by carboxylic or hydroxamic HDACis (<figref>FIG. 33</figref>). Although the class specificity of PTBA has not yet been confirmed, it can be hypothesized to function as a Class I/Ha-specific inhibitor like other carboxylic acids.</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0185">Several inferences can be made from these isoform specificities. First, if PTBA efficacy in zebrafish embryos does indeed require the inhibition of one or more HDAC isoforms, then hdacs 6, 10, and 11 are probably not targeted. Therefore, it is possible that the increased toxicity observed in TSA-treated embryos may result from its effect on these hdacs. Of particular interest is HDAC6, which functions as a microtubule-associated deacetylase (Hubbert, C. et al. HDAC6 is a microtubule-associated deacetylase. Nature 417, 455-458, (2002)). Affecting the posttranslational modifications of the microtubule network causes broad effects on cell signaling and the maintenance of homeostasis. However, embryos treated with tubacin, an HDAC6-specific HDACi (Haggarty, S. J., et al. Domain-selective small-molecule inhibitor of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6)-mediated tubulin deacetylation. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100, 4389-4394, (2003)), appeared wild-type in my phenotypic screens. It is possible that tubacin's LogP of 6.34, the highest of any tested PTBA analog, may prevent efficient compound absorption and could account for the lack of phenotype. Furthermore, the broad specificity of hydroxamic HDACis suggested that hydroxamic PTBA analogs would demonstrate greater efficacy at the expense of increased toxicity. Indeed, several hydroxamic analogs increased lhx1a expression in treated embryos at concentrations equal to or less than PTBA. However, the ata from zebrafish embryos and podocyte culture suggest that this modification has little to no effect on compound toxicity. This may imply that the hydroxamic analogs remain weak inhibitors despite the improved strength of the zinc-binding group. Accordingly, their HDACi activity should be determined empirically in future in vitro assays. Alternatively, the products generated from the metabolism of TSA may cause the deleterious effects observed in treated embryos. Indeed, some evidence suggests that the N-demethylated byproducts of TSA remain pharmacologically active and persist in the circulation for at least an hour following administration (Sanderson, L. et al. Plasma pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin after intraperitoneal administration to mice. Drug Metab Dispos 32, 1132-1138, (2004)). However, it is currently unknown if these metabolic waste products affect normal cellular processes.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0186">Previous clinical studies with known HDACis suggest that structural analogs of PTBA may function as viable therapeutics. Indeed, both trichostatin A (Vorinostat) and valproic acid have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for oral administration to treat T-cell lymphoma and epilepsy, respectively. Importantly, the sodium salt of PBA (Buphenyl), one of the closest structural analogs of PTBA, also received FDA approval in 1996 for the treatment of urea cycle disorders. To date, Buphenyl remains the only FDA-approved treatment for chronic management of the excess blood ammonia (hyperammonemia) generated by enzymatic deficiencies in urea metabolism. Prescribed daily doses of Buphenyl as an oral medication often reach gram quantities, with some patients taking as much as 20 g/day. Thus, it may be possible to safely administer other PTBA analogs at similarly high doses. In addition, Buphenyl exhibits good bioavailability of about 80% when taken orally. Unfortunately, Buphenyl has a short half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>Ë1 hr) following administration, as it is rapidly converted to phenylacetic acid. However, this limitation can be easily overcome by prescribing multiple daily dosings. Therefore, the favorable pharmacological properties of sodium PBA support the future development of other PTBA analogs for clinical use.</p>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0187">Certain questions remain open from this study. Although, the zebrafish pronephros serves as an excellent model of individual metanephric nephrons, metanephroi are complex organs consisting of millions of nephrons. It is unknown how accurately simple pronephric models reflect conditions within the broader context of general metanephric kidney function. Future experiments with PTBA analogs in mouse models of kidney injury may help to address this. Furthermore, while my data suggest that PTBA treatment affects normal pronephric function, thus causing the edemic phenotype, this was not determined empirically. Although the pronephros is almost certainly nonfunctional at 48 hpf because the glomerulus has not yet formed, fluorescent dextran injections could provide further confirmation. Indeed, it would be interesting to determine if PTBA-treated embryos manage to form functional pronephroi later in development. This research has provided some insight into the mechanism of PTBA efficacy, revealing the involvement of the RA signaling pathway and HDAC inhibition. However, the specific target of PTBA activity remains unknown. Ostensibly, this should be an HDAC isoform or isoforms, perhaps representing a specific HDAC class. However, it is important to note that HDACis modify many non-histone proteins in their capacity as lysine deacetylases (Buchwald, M., et al. HDACiâtargets beyond chromatin. Cancer Lett 280, 160-167, (2009)). These targets include hormone receptors, signal transducers, transcriptions factors, structural proteins, and chaperones. Therefore, target identification may not be a straightforward prospect. However, an investigation of possible HDAC targets still represents the best place to start. These preliminary results suggest that the expression patterns of individual HDAC isoforms remain relatively ubiquitous in 24 hpf zebrafish embryos (data not shown). It may be helpful to determine if any of these become compartmentalized in the pronephric region later in development. These isoforms would be good candidates as potential PTBA effectors. Furthermore, like other carboxylic acid HDACis, PTBA would be expected to exhibit some Class I/IIa specificity. If this characteristic is confirmed in future investigations, then isoforms of these classes should also merit some interest. Morpholino knockdown of these candidates in an effort to recapitulate lhx1a expansion in the IM would provide an excellent approach for target validation. When developing potential human therapeutics using zebrafish, consideration should be given to the variation in HDAC orthologs across species. Although zebrafish hdacs, such as hdac1, share a large degree of amino acid identity with the HDACs of other vertebrates, discrepancies remain (<figref>FIG. 34</figref>). These differences could alter the efficacy of PTBA or its analogs when applied in other model systems or in humans. Encouragingly, PTBA demonstrated the ability to function in vitro as an HDACi using human HDAC isoforms derived from HeLa cell extracts. However, this result does not eliminate the possibility of differing efficacies when assessing individual HDAC orthologs.</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0188">In addition to the points raised above, several other open questions remain unanswered. Potent HDACis, such as SAHA and MS-275, showed no effect on zebrafish embryos when they were treated at 3 This was an unexpected result which could reflect poor absorption of the compounds into the embryos, short half-lives, or a zebrafish-specific effect. Hyperacetylation assays could be performed to determine if the compounds are indeed able to exert a physiological effect on embryos, despite the lack of edemic phenotype. Furthermore, exploring the downstream effects of HDAC inhibition, such as the stimulation of coactivators, would provide further confirmation of the mechanism of PTBA efficacy. For example, pharmacologically inhibiting the activity of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) would be expected to block PTBA efficacy by interfering with its signaling. One final point of interest is better understanding the differences in PTBA efficacy when compared to TSA in the in vitro and in vivo assays. In vitro, TSA is thousands of times more effective than PTBA in inhibiting HDAC activity, while in vivo the difference is greatly reduced. Of course, the varying HDAC class specificities of the two compounds may play a role in this effect. However, the structural elements of PTBA, particularly the thiol group, is suspected to provide the compound with unique in vivo pharmacokinetics.</p>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0189">These results demonstrate that several PTBA analogs exhibit improved efficacy with little to no increase in toxicity. These second generation compounds are excellent candidates to improve renal recovery in future animal studies. However, this work marks only the first steps in the development of this family of compounds. Using only simple functional group substitutions, we were able to identify PTBA structural analogs that were only several times less effective than TSA. However, these same analogs exhibit several hundred times less toxicity than TSA in podocyte cell culture. This represents the key benefit offered by this class of âweakâ inhibitors. It is true that almost all of the effective PTBA analogs cause some degree of edemic and/or lethal phenotypes during zebrafish development. However, these teratogenic effects should not be an issue when treating an adult, whose tissues primarily consist of differentiated cells. Indeed, as shown below, PTC-DTR mice treated with m4PTB exhibit no overt signs of toxicity (data not shown). Because the second generation PTBA analogs exhibit little toxicity, there is still ample room for further efficacy improvements. The results of my research offer some guidelines for this process. In general, substitutions of the aliphatic cap region increased compound efficacy. Adding functional groups to the phenyl ring represents a simple way to increase the LogP value of the base compound, which may aid absorption through biological membranes. Alternatively, the cap substitutions may interact with amino acids in the binding pocket of the HDAC, improving the affinity of the compound. Interestingly, even halogenated groups, which are often metabolized into toxic byproducts (Pohl, L. R. et al. Electrophilic halogens as potentially toxic metabolites of halogenated compounds. <i>Trends Pharmacol Sci </i>5, 61-64, (1984)), appear to be tolerable. The sulfur atom forming the connecting unit of PTBA also appears to be an activity determinant. In comparison to its substituted analogs, only PTBA exhibited significant efficacy. Since the LogP values of PTBA and the analogs carrying connecting unit substitutions are similar, it is doubtful that improved absorption plays a role. More likely, the sulfur atom forms unique interactions within the HDAC binding pocket. This may include serving as a hydrogen bond acceptor due to the presence of an unbound electron pair.</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0190">Unfortunately, only one analog carrying a linker group was available for testing. Adding a bulky ring structure to the linker decreased the analog's efficacy relative to PTBA. The increased rigidity of the normally flexible hydrophobic chain may explain this effect. It is believed that increasing the length of the linker region remains an untapped opportunity to generate a better analog. Indeed, the linkers of the more potent HDACis, including TSA and SAHA, contain seven and eight carbons respectively. Finally, analogs carrying methylated or hydroxamic zinc-binding groups exhibit improved efficacy. Adding alkyl groups to the zinc-binding group might be expected to interfere with the formation of coordinate bonds with the active site zinc. However, it is likely that the ubiquitous esterases found in target cells hydrolyze and remove the alkyl groups upon absorption. Furthermore, since alkylation prevents deprotonization of the carboxylic acid, these analogs would be expected to be more effective in buffered solutions. The hydroxamic analogs of PTBA also demonstrated improved efficacy, although perhaps not as much as expected. Although they possess stronger zinc-binding groups, they suffer from increased polarity as evidenced by lower LogP values. Therefore, the expected increase in binding affinity may be counterbalanced by decreased absorption Importantly, the hydroxamic PTBA analogs demonstrate none of the toxicity of TSA in cell culture experiments. Further modifications of these structures, perhaps incorporating some elements of the TSA structure, may yield a family of highly potent compounds.</p>

      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0191">Initial studies, above, used a phenotypic marker of the ability to expand the renal progenitor cell field in larval zebrafish, and identified the first member of a novel class of HDAC inhibitors, PTBA as well as a few structural and functional analogs. These findings form the basis for further study. However, this technology is limited as it is dependent on subjective interpretation of a subtle phenotypic change in the fish. Therefore, in order to develop a more objective and higher content screen, we developed an image-based high-content screen using transgenic zebrafish (Vogt A, et al. Automated image-based phenotypic analysis in zebrafish embryos. Dev Dyn. 2009; 238(3):656-63). For this we first generated transgenic cad17:EGFP zebrafish which express GFP in renal tubular epithelium. By treating zebrafish embryos and allowing them to develop into larvae, we can use Tg(Cad17:EGFP) zebrafish to identify expansion of the renal field. Tg(Cad17:EGFP) zebrafish is a transgenic line that was prepared by isolation of an approximately 5 kb (5066 bp) promoter element and approximately 3 kb (3221 bp) first intron element from the cadherin 17 locus, cloning it into a plasmid along with the enchanced GFP open reading frame and injecting if into zebrafish embryos to established transgenic lines using the meganuclease transgenesis method (Soroldoni et al., Simple and efficient transgenesis with meganuclease constructs in zebrafish, Methods Mol Bio 2009; 546: 117-30.).</p>

Structure assignment is achieved by detection of regions within the image based on features such as brightness, size, and shape. What permits the identification of biologically meaningful domains (head, tail, yolk, tubules) from those initial features is that a human observer immediately assigns context-specific information to objects based on their knowledge of larval morphology. CNT provides this context by permitting users to assign relational information to image objects through context-dependent classification and segmentation to produce a network of objects and relationships. The method is independent of imaging platform, image format, and phenotype.</p>

      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0194">The goal of these studies is to evaluate PTBA analogues with improved activity/toxicity characteristics. Since the lead compound, PTBA, is a carboxylic acid, there are potential stability issues in buffered environments such as blood. It is also desirable to utilize compounds that have effective dose ranges in the nano-molar range, as these are more likely to be useful in vivo. As described above, several PTBA analogs were synthesized, including methyl, n-propyl, and sec-butyl PTBA. The methyl PTBA (m4PTB) analogue, demonstrated an effective dose for the renal progenitor assay in the 800 nM range, and it is shown to be effective in accelerating functional recovery from AKI (see <figref>FIG. 38</figref>). The efficacy of the new PTBA derivatives relative to that of m4PTB is being evaluated, and those compounds with equal or greater activity of m4PTB can be used in a next phase of the screen.</p>
      <p id="p-00205-en" num="0195">Considerations in Designing and Synthesizing New PTBA Analogues:</p>
      <p id="p-00206-en" num="0196">Esterified compounds, such as m4PTB offer desirable characteristics for absorption and distribution in mammals, providing a first avenue of pursuit in analog building. Commercially available thiophenols (i.e., substituted on the phenyl or naphthyl rings) are prepared in order to determine the constraints of electron density and bulk on the aromatic region. A short series of esters designed to extend the biological lifetime of PTBA are prepared (i.e., ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl and tert-butyl). All of these are easily achievable at the gram scale. Two mixed esters of PTBA (and any active phenyl-substituted or naphthyl analogues) are prepared. For the reverse ester, valproic acid ethyl ester is reduced to its alcohol, which is then used to esterify PTBA. Some of these esters contain a chiral carbon in the alcohol-derived portion of the compound (e.g., sec-butyl, valproyl and valproate). Those esters with such chirality, if active, are separated into their enantiomers by HPLC or supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) using standard techniques and the enatiomers tested for activity. Finally, the free acid forms of PTBA and its phenyl ring-substituted/expanded analogues are converted to their hydroxamide forms via activation of the acid moiety and reaction with hydroxylamine. Based on this combinatorial chemistry, we expect to generate Ë200 PTBA analogues for screening using the zebrafish reporter assay. Compounds that prove effective are scaled up for the mouse studies.</p>
      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0197">Considerations in Screening New Analogues for Renal Progenitor Cell Expansion:</p>
      <p id="p-00208-en" num="0198">For all second-generation compounds, the cad17:EGFP transgene is used as the primary readout to assay for expansion of kidney field (<figref>FIG. 35</figref>). PTBA analogues that expand cad17:EGFP expression are subjected to a secondary screen. The secondary screen utilizes two lines, Tg(lhx1a:EGFP) (Swanhart et al., 2010 Characterization of an lhx1a transgenic reporter in zebrafish, Int J Dev Biol 54(4): 731-6) and Tg(pax2a:GFP)(Picker et al., A novel positive transcriptional feedback loop in midbrain-hindbrain boundary development is revealed through analysis of the zebrafish pax2.1 promoter in transgenic lines, Development 2002 129 (13): 3227-39). The lhx1a:EGFP and pax2a:GFP transgenic lines are expressed in renal progenitor cells (see above), and allows confirmation that expansion of the nephric field seen with cad17:EGFP is the result of expansion of renal progenitor cells. The described analog families are expected to result in more than 200 new compounds. While we can handle all the compound dose curves in the lhx1a:EGFP and pax2a:GFP reporter assay, we can employ the Topliss approach for analogue synthesis to initially narrow our focus (Martin Y C, et al. Examination of the utility of the Topliss schemes for analog synthesis. J Med Chem. 1973; 16(5):578-9). Dosage curves for each new compound are added to Tg(cad17:EGFP) embryos starting an 3 uM as the high dose and using a semi-log curve (1 uM, 600 nM, 300 nM, 60 nM, 30 nM) and assayed for expansion of the nephric mesoderm. Since m4PTB is responsive in the 800 nM range, we focus on second-generation compounds that have lower effective dose. Such compounds are assessed in target efficacy and toxicity assays.</p>

PTBA analogs are used at a dose range determined from comparative dose efficacy with m4PTB in the secondary zebrafish screen. Acetylated Histone H3 K9 (Ac-H3 K9) is evaluated, as this is most easily detected by Western blot in nuclear extracts from mouse renal tissues. Preliminary studies compared the effect of Trichostatin A (an established, but toxic HDACi) at an effective dose in the zebrafish screen (0.2 mM) with an equivalent dose of m4PTB (0.8 mM), and then X2 and X4 dose increments (molar concentration in vivo based on estimate uniform distribution relative to body mass of water). 3.4 mg/kg (4Ã) m4PTB induced maximal expression of Ac-H3 K9 after 24 hours (<figref>FIG. 36</figref>). This effect was increased compared with TSA or lower doses of m4PTB, so we elected to use this dose of m4PTB (3.4 mg/kg) for AKI studies in mice. For definitive studies, we can compare 1Ã, 2Ã and 4Ã equivalent doses of each new PTBA analogue with 3.4 mg/kg m4PTB, and evaluate renal Ac-H3 K9 at the indicated time points.

In addition renal function (BUN and creatinine), liver function (AST, ALT, ALP, Bilirubin and Albumin) and CBC (WBC, Hb and platelets) from terminal blood samples are evaluated.

      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0206">We have developed a mouse model of AKI that is ideally suited for our primary screening studies. Our experience with the more established models (ischemia/reperfusion, HgCl<sub>2 </sub>and cisplatin) has shown that there is significant variability between mice such that functional studies have to be performed with 10-15 mice per group. Transgenic mice express the diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor, human HB-EGF, in proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTC) using a 2.2 kb fragment of the proximal gGT-1 promotor. Characterization of transgene expression indicates that hHB-EGF is only expressed in PTCs (&gt;95% of cells, data not shown). A single IP injection of DT causes AKI in transgenic but not wild type mice, with dose-dependent PTC injury and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN, a measure of renal function) that peaks between days 3 and 4 and returns to baseline by day 7 (<figref>FIG. 37</figref>). Male transgenic mice are more sensitive to DT than female mice, which show a milder and slightly later peak in BUN (see <figref>FIG. 38</figref>). However, we find reproducibly tight data points in both female and male mice using 5-6 mice per group. Moreover, while BUN returns to baseline after 7 days, there is renal fibrosis at higher doses of DT (<figref>FIG. 37</figref>, panel D). The latter finding is important since the purpose of this screen is to identify compounds that accelerate tubular regeneration following injury, and in so doing prevent long-term fibrotic sequelae resulting from severe AKI, which is being recognized increasingly as a cause of chronic renal insufficiency.</p>
      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0207">We evaluated efficacy and effective dosage of a second-generation PTBA analogue, m4PTB, by determining the kinetics of renal Histone H3 K9 acetylation (H3K9Ac) following a single SC injection. We saw maximal induction of H3K9A at 3.4 mg/kg, which persisted for 24 hours (<figref>FIG. 36</figref>). Therefore, using the PTC-DTR model, we treated female transgenic mice with 3.4 mg/kg m4PTB (or 1% DMSO vehicle) 24 hours after injection with DT (0.1 mg/kg, a dose of that induces relatively mild AKI), and continued with daily m4PTB (or control) injections for 6 days. There was a significant, 30% reduction in peak BUN 4 days after injury in the m4PTB group (<figref>FIG. 38</figref>). Moreover, while further studies are being performed to determine: 1) whether m4PTB is efficacious in more severe DT-induced AKI; and 2) whether accelerated renal recovery from more severe AKI is associated with reduced renal fibrosis at 4 week, these findings establish m4PTB as our first lead compound for further testing in mouse models of AKI.</p>
      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0208">Studies performed in male PTC-DTR mice using two different doses of DT predicted to induce mild (0.1 mg/kg) and severe AKI (1 mg/kg) (see <figref>FIG. 37</figref>), determine whether PTBA analogues have beneficial effect in mild, severe AKI or both. Treatment with the PTBA analogue is initiated 24 hours after DT injection and continued daily thereafter for 7 days. Each study includes 3 groups of mice: 1% DMSO (vehicle), m4PTB at 3.4 mg/kg/day and the new analogue at the dose established from renal histone acetylation studies. Based on our experience using this model seven mice per group are used. Mice have daily BUN assays. If BUN improves significantly (as determined by area under the curve growth curve analysis and post-hoc T-Test with Bonferroni correction), results are validated on the same samples by measuring serum creatinine by HPLC (Yuen P S, Dunn S R, Miyaji T, Yasuda H, Sharma K, Star RA. A simplified method for HPLC determination of creatinine in mouse serum. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol. 2004; 286(6):F1116-9). In addition to measuring BUN, mice are sacrificed at 28 days to evaluate renal fibrosis (trichrome blue and sirius red staining). Quantification of tubular atrophy and fibrotic indices and collagen accumulation from sirius red staining are quantified using the BIQUANT image analysis system. These analyses determine whether the PTBA analogues also reduce long term renal fibrosis following AKI. Compounds that accelerate recovery from AKI as well or better than m4PTB and that also reduce long term fibrosis are moved forward onto the secondary screening studies in mice.</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0209">Compounds that accelerate AKI recovery as well or better than m4PTB, and show beneficial effects on post-injury renal fibrosis in our primary screen, will be studied more extensively. This secondary screen will evaluate effects of these compounds using three other models of AKI that reflect the spectrum of disease pathology in human AKI: 1) ischemia/reperfusion; 2) toxin (cisplatin); and 3) sepsis (caecal ligation and perforation). Studies are performed using an outbred strain of mice (CD1) in order to more closely mimic the greater genetic diversity of patients in clinical settings.</p>

      <heading id="h-00022-en" level="1">Additional Models</heading>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0210">Caecal Ligation Model of AK:</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0211">mice are treated with second generation PTBA analogues 24 hours after injury and outcome determined relative to m4PTB and vehicle. BUN and serum creatinine are evaluated in all the mice, as well as renal histology for fibrosis on follow up where long term survival is feasible (ischemia/reperfusion and cisplatin models), as outlined above. For models showing improved renal function and/or beneficial effects on long term renal fibrosis, additional cohorts of mice are set up to evaluate renal histology pre-injury, at day of peak BUN and 7 days post-injury for renal tubular injury scores, tubular proliferation (BrdU incorporation) and apoptosis indices (TUNEL assay). Details of the specific models are outlined below:</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0212">Ischemia/Reperfusion (IR) Injury:</p>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0213">IR injury provides a model of AKI that mimics the effects of hypotension, hypovolemia and aortic surgery on the kidney in humans. Injury occurs in highly metabolically active S3 segment PTCs in the outer stripe of the medulla. The model originally developed in rats has been modified for use in mice (Kennedy S E, Erlich J H. Murine renal ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Nephrology (Carlton). 2008; 13(5):390-6) (19).</p>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0214">Cisplatin-Induced AKI:</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0215">There are different models of nephrotoxin-induced AKI. Cisplatin has direct cytotoxic effects on both proximal and distal tubular epithelium (dominant cortical PTCs) and has been used extensively as a model of AKI in mice and rats. Moreover, cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of a variety of different malignancies, so the model has relevance to a human disorder. Mice injected on two consecutive days with 10 mg/kg cisplatin IP develop reproducible and reversible injury over a 7-day course but with reasonable survival (death occurs from bone marrow suppression and AKI) (Bi B, Schmitt R, Israilova M, Nishio H, Cantley L G. Stromal cells protect against acute tubular injury via an endocrine effect. J Am Soc Nephrol. 2007; 18(9):2486-96).</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0216">Sepsis (Cecal Ligation and Perforation):</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0217">Sepsis is one of the most common causes of AKI in humans, and is a contributory factor in the etiology of AKI in many different settings (including hypotensive AKI). One model that reflects the clinical scenario of sepsis-associated AM is a surgical model that involves cecal ligation and limited cecal perforation (Doi K, Leelahavanichkul A, Yuen P S, Star R A. Animal models of sepsis and sepsis-induced kidney injury. J Clin Invest. 2009; 119(10):2868-78. PMCID: 2752080). By limiting the length of the ligated cecum, and treating mice with broad-spectrum antibiotics and S/C normal saline each day, mice survive for a period of 5-7 days and reproducibly develop AKI. PTBA analogue treatments are initiated 24 hours after surgery, as outlined above.</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0218">Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction (UUO):</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0219">The model of unilateral ureteral obstruction generates progressive renal fibrosis. Surgically created UUO can be experimentally manipulated with respect to timing, severity, and duration, while reversal of the obstruction permits the study of recovery.</p>
      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0220">Alternatively, the LPS-induced AKI model in which transient AKI is induced by infusion of LPS (Doi K, et al. J Clin Invest. 2009; 119(10):2868-78. PMCID: 2752080) can be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0221">PTBA analogues will accelerate the rate of renal recovery in AKI. However, the efficacy of any single compound-based therapy is necessarily limited by the maximal biological activity of their class. Since we know that this class of HDACi improves the rate of recovery following AKI, a complementary approach is to determine if a combination of compounds is more effective than a PTBA analogue alone. This combinatorial approach is a standard clinical methodology for treating disease (Boner G, et al. Combination antihypertensive therapy in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes Technol Ther. 2002; 4(3):313-21). On this basis, by evaluating the effect of sub-optimal levels of the lead PTBA analogue, m4PTB, in combination with either (a) FDA approved drugs or (b) drug-like compounds, we expect to find a combination that can greatly expand the renal progenitor cell population in our zebrafish screen.</p>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0222">Whole-Embryo Combinatorial-Synergism Screen:</p>
      <p id="p-00233-en" num="0223">We know that m4PTB can cause a measurable expansion of the cad17:EGFP transgene at dose between 800 nM to 1 Î¼M (<figref>FIG. 35</figref>). In addition, in an renal progenitor cell study using the lhx1a:EGFP transgene, we can start to see expansion of the renal progenitor cell population at doses as low as 600 nM (data not shown). Therefore, a combinatorial-synergism screen is performed by combining 600 nM m4PTB with different compound libraries. As with the second-generation compound screen, the cad17:EGFP transgene is used as the primary readout for expansion of kidney field, and compounds that expand cad17:EGFP expression are subjected to a secondary screen. Those compounds that enhance efficacy of sub-optimal doses of m4PTB are evaluated for combinatorial drug toxicity and efficacy, before progressing to our primary AM screen.</p>
      <p id="p-00234-en" num="0224">Compound Selection:</p>
      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0225">It is important to seek new structures as well as to improve on the activity and selectivity of the current inhibitors we have identified. Therefore, (1) collections of FDA approved drugs or agents with known biological activity are examined and (2) libraries of maximal chemical diversity selected for their drug-like characteristics are interrogated. We have in hand the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC), the NCI 400 compound clinical trial set, and the 10,000-member TimTec ActiProbe library. The LOPAC library is extensively used at the UPDDI and contains 1280 compounds with known biological activity, including FDA approved drugs. The NCI 400 compound clinical trial set of FDA approved compounds. (Our original compound was found in the NCI diversity set.) The ActiProbe library was computationally selected by Jarvis-Patrick sampling to represent the chemical diversity of a large 2,000,000 member compound collection, and is biased towards diverse drug-like molecules through cheminformatics filtering including Lipinski Rule parameters.</p>
      <p id="p-00236-en" num="0226">Screen Outcomes:</p>
      <p id="p-00237-en" num="0227">We expect to identify a set of compounds that can work in concert with m4PTB to improve post-renal damage recovery. Once a hit is found a dose curve is performed in combination with m4PTB and individually for the new hit. Any compounds that expand the renal progenitor cell population without the aid of m4PTB (not an additive effect, but an independent effect) are just as important as compounds that work in a synergistic manner. If a large number of hits are identified, those that work in combination with m4PTB are priority compounds for assessing in mouse toxicity and efficacy studies. By using m4PTB, any potential hits can be moved quickly though the efficacy and toxicity studies into the PTC-DTR AKI model.</p>

AKI is generated as above with gentamycin, essentially as described in Example 11. Four m4PTB was added 2 days post injection of gentamicin. Zebrafish larvae at 5 days post injection were treated for 1 hour with the thymidine analogue EdU (10 milimolar), which incorporates into dividing (proliferating cells) while the larvae are in the zebrafish E3 media. The larvae where then fixed and processed for histology to count the number of proliferating cells in the proximal convoluted tubule (as marked by the antibody 3G8). The number of proliferating cells was divided by the total number of cells in the proximal convoluted tubule to generate the percent of proliferation also known as the proliferation index as shown in <figref>FIG. 43</figref>. Renal cell proliferation is significantly increased in the presence of m4PTB.</p>

      <p id="p-00260-en" num="0249">Surgeries were performed on a water-bath heated platform at 38Â° C. on 10-12 week old male BALB/c mice. For moderate IR-AKI, mice underwent a right nephrectomy followed by left renal pedicle clamping (800 gm pressure clamp, FST 18052-03). The clamp was released after 26 minutes, and tissue reperfusion was confirmed before completing the surgery. Mce were treated daily with indicated doses of compounds or equivalent volume of 20% 2-hydroxypropyl-Î²-cyclodextrin in water as vehicle control starting 24 h after injury. Since initial injury with this model is variable, mice were randomly allocated vehicle or m4PTB treatment if their serum creatinine levels were 0.8 to 1.2 mg/dl 24 h post IR injury. Other mice were excluded from further analysis and euthanized. To induce severe IR-AKI, mice underwent left renal pedicle clamping for 30 minutes and delayed contralateral nephrectomy was performed after 8 days.</p>

      <p id="p-00261-en" num="0250">For mouse studies, kidney sections were stained using Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) to assess renal tubular injury. Tubular injury (casts, dilated tubules, epithelial cell blebbing, and vacuolization, loss of brush borders or nuclei) was scored as described. Sirius red staining was performed using an established protocol used to evaluate renal fibrosis/collagen accumulation in kidney sections. To quantify Sirius red staining we used an Olympus BX-41 microscope equipped with an Olympus DP-72 digital camera system and polarizing light filter. Results are expressed as the mean percent fibrosis for all of the images per slide region (Sirius red positive/total surface area).</p>

We could achieve concentrations of up to Ë12 mg/ml of PTBA analogues in 20% CD in water (100 mg/kg in volumes of Ë150-250 Î¼l), and daily IP injections with 200 Î¼l 20% CD in water had no effect on renal functional recovery following IR-AKI. Therefore all studies were performed using compounds dissolved in 20% CD. To assess dosing and biological activity of PTBA analogues in mice, CD1 mice were injected with varying doses of compounds IP and kidneys isolated at different time point for histone extraction and analysis of histone H4 acetylation, a marker of HDAC inhibitor activity, as outlined below. Based on results of these studies, mice were treated daily with 1, 10, 50 or 100 mg/kg of compound or equivalent volume of 20% CD vehicle control starting 24 h after injury.</p>

This assay has been evaluated in mouse and rat serum samples and unlike picric acid based creatinine assays, was shown to closely parallel HPLC measurements of serum creatinine. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) was determined in duplicate samples using a colorimetric enzymatic assay kit (Infinity Urea, Thermo Scientific), and spot urinary albumin/creatinine ratios determined using a mouse albumin ELISA and urinary creatinine assay kit (Albuwell and Creatinine Companion, Exocell).</p>

After washing in PBS, samples were stored in 70% ethanol before processing and mounting in paraffin for histological analysis and immunostaining.

After 20 minutes, samples were clarified by centrifugation and acidic supernatants neutralized with 5Ã neutralization buffer (Active Motif). After quantification, 5 Î¼g of total protein was separated on a denaturing 4-10% Tris Glycine polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. Fluorescent immunoblot analysis, blocking, incubation times and washes were performed using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System, as outlined in the manufacturer's instructions (LI-COR Odyssey). We used rabbit monoclonal anti-total histone H4 (Clone 62) and rabbit anti-acetylated H4 Lysine 5/8/12 and 16 antibodies (Millipore, pan H4 acetylation), infrared 680LT conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (LI-COR), and fluorescence images were captured using the Odyssey Laser Fluorescence Detection System.</p>

Serum creatinine was measured at day 9 and shows better activity for compounds 25 and 186. Fibrotic (scar) tissue was measured using Sirus Red after 28 days for various markers of fibrosis. As can be seen, compounds 25 and 186 result in the most reduction in fibrosis.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 45</figref> shows the reduction in post injury fibrosis in severe ischemia-reperfusion model of AKI using various dosages of UPHD-00186. As can be seen on this Figure, compound UPHD-00186 is efficient at elevated doses (50 mg/kg) and is potentially in the class of prodrugs.</p>
      <p id="p-00268-en" num="0257">
        <figref>FIG. 46</figref> represents the timing of UPHD-00186 treatment in severe IR-AKI. UPHD-00186 renal function and fibrosis in mice IR-AKI. As can be seen, UPHD-00186 can provide treatment after severe ischemia-reperfusion injury from 1-7 days and has still a significant effect on IR-AKI after more than 7 days.</p>

      <p id="p-00269-en" num="0258">
        <figref>FIG. 47</figref> represents the results of the testing of compounds UPHD-00022, UPHD-00025 (PTBA), UPHD-00029, UPHD-00036, and UPHD-00186, for their efficacy in mouse models of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) as follows: in the UUO models, one ureter was ligated for 7 days and compounds were delivered via IP for days 0 to 6. At day 7 kidneys were harvested for Sirius red staining. As can be seen in <figref>FIGS. 47A and 47B</figref>, in UUO, UPHD-00186, 00022, 00029 and 00036 reduce both fibrosis and expression of fibrosis markers. In addition, UPHD-186 treatment 3 days after IR-AKI still markedly reduces post injury fibrosis after IR-AKI (<figref>FIG. 48</figref>), performed essentially as indicated in Example 13 and <figref>FIG. 46A</figref>. Therefore, in the models tested, the only compound proven to be effective in all models and with significant delayed onset of treatment is UPHD-186.</p>
      <heading id="h-00051-en" level="2">Results</heading>
      <p id="p-00270-en" num="0259">UPHD-186 is a pro-regenerative therapy that is effective in preventing post injury fibrosis in multiple AKI models. UPHD-186 is more effective than the FDA approved HDAC<sub>i </sub>drug Vorinostat (SAHA) in preventing post injury fibrosis in UUO. UPHD-186 can be administered for short periods, days after initiating injury and still prevents fibrosis. This property of UPHD-186 as a short-term therapy that reduces post AKI fibrosis when administered over a broad time window has not previously been reported in the AKI literature, and has great potential for clinical application for short-term therapy to prevent CKD progression in patients with AKI.</p>
