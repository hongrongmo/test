    <summary>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">Present invention relates to a composition and a process for the permanent shaping of human hair used both for the permanent waving of human hair with an excellent waving effect as well as for the straightening of either naturally or chemically curled hair wherein optimum hair conditioning is observed.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">It is generally known that permanent waving is carried out in two steps, the reductive splitting of the cysteine disulfide bonds in the hair by a reducing agent and the subsequent neutralization by application of an oxidizing agent, whereby the cysteine disulfide bonds are restored.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The reducing agent still most frequently used today is thioglycolic acid, also in form of the salts thereof, in particular its ammonium salt, although numerous other thio compounds have been proposed for this purpose, which, however, mostly did not succeed.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The compositions containing thioglycolates are customarily applied at a pH-value between 7 and 10, in particular 8.5 and 9.5.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Such compositions vary in their waving and/or straightening performance and, therefore, there is still need for further improvement, especially in permanent shaping of damaged to strongly damaged hair and in particular for permanent shaping hair streaks including parts with various damage level in length and also improvement in hair condition after such carrying our permanent shaping process.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The present invention starts from the task of providing a composition for the permanent shaping of human hair with excellent waving and straightening performance, especially homogeneous curling and straightening efficiency on hair comprising parts with various degree of damage. Hair waved or straightened with composition disclosed herein looks and feels natural upon touching by hand and has improved shine. For waved hair it is especially important that the hair has excellent elasticity and bounce.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Accordingly, the first object of the present invention is an aqueous composition for permanent shaping and/or straightening hair based on at least one reducing agent and comprising further ethylene/octene copolymer dispersed in an aqueous medium comprising ethylene/sodium acrylate copolymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Further object of the present invention is the use of an aqueous composition comprising at least one reducing agent and ethylene/octene copolymer dispersed in an aqueous medium comprising ethylene/sodium acrylate copolymer for permanent shaping and/or straightening hair. Additionally hair is well conditioned with the use in terms of feeling natural upon touching by hand, shine elasticity and bounce.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Further object of the present invention is a process for permanent shaping hair comprising the steps wherein hair is washed or shampooed or made wet and applied an aqueous composition comprising at least one reducing agent and ethylene/octene copolymer dispersed in an aqueous medium comprising ethylene/sodium acrylate copolymer and processed for 1 to 30 min and rinsed off from hair and subsequently an aqueous composition comprising at least one oxidizing agent is applied and after processing of 1 to 30 min optionally rinsed off from hair.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Further object of the present invention is a process for permanent shaping hair comprising the steps wherein hair is shampooed or washed or made wet and applied an aqueous composition comprising at least one reducing agent and processed for 1 to 30 min and rinsed off from hair and subsequently an aqueous composition comprising at least one oxidizing agent is applied and after processing of 1 to 30 min optionally rinsed off from hair wherein one of the two composition comprises ethylene/octene copolymer dispersed in an aqueous medium comprising ethylene/sodium acrylate copolymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In a further object of the present invention is a process for permanent shaping hair comprising the steps wherein hair is shampooed or washed or made wet and applied an aqueous composition comprising at least one reducing agent and processed for 1 to 30 min and rinsed off from hair and subsequently an aqueous composition comprising at least one oxidizing agent preferably selected from hydrogen peroxide or sodium bromate and ethylene/octene copolymer dispersed in an aqueous medium comprising ethylene/sodium acrylate copolymer and after processing of 1 to 30 min optionally rinsed off from hair.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Still further object the present invention is a process for permanent shaping hair comprising the steps wherein hair is shampooed or washed or made wet and applied an aqueous composition comprising at least one reducing agent and processed for 1 to 30 min and rinsed off from hair and subsequently an aqueous composition comprising at least one inorganic salt is applied onto hair and without rinsing of the composition a third aqueous composition comprising at least one oxidizing agent is applied and after processing of 1 to 30 min optionally rinsed off from hair wherein at least one of the three compositions comprises ethylene/octene copolymer dispersed in an aqueous medium comprising ethylene/sodium acrylate copolymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In the above processes, in case the process is carried out for curling of hair, hair is wound on the curlers either after shampooing or washing or wetting or during the application of the reducing agent or after application of the reducing agent. The curlers are taken off from hair after rinsing off the reducing agent or after application of intermediate treatment or before application of the oxidizing agent or after application of the oxidizing agent or at the end of the processing time of oxidizing agent. The time of wounding onto curlers and taking them off is very much dependent on the curling strength aimed. For stronger curls it is preferred that the wounding onto curlers is done before application of the reducing agent and curlers are taken off at the end of the processing time of oxidizing agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Ethylene/octene copolymer dispersed in an aqueous medium comprising ethylene/sodium acrylate copolymer is a commercially available raw material under the trade name EcoSmooth Silk from Dow Chemical Company comprising 40 to 44% active matter.</p>

      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The permanent shaping compositions containing reducing agents can, if necessary, comprise alkalizing agents. Their quantity is dependent on the reducing agent and the desired pH-value of the composition.

Alkalizing agents preferred within the scope of the invention are ammonium carbamate, ammonia and/or ammonium(bi)carbonate, monoethanolamine and triethanolamine. It is desirable to adjust the pH-value between about 6.5 and 10.5, preferably about 7 to 9.5.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Permanent shaping compositions according to the invention are suited for use both for the permanent waving, i.e. curling of human hair and for the straightening, i.e. smoothing thereof.</p>

      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0053">With this composition the hair was permanently waved for about 15 minutes, rinsed and neutralized for about 8 minutes with a customary 2.5% H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2 </sub>composition. Homogeneous wave appearance was obtained which had excellent elasticity and bounce and improved shine and felt natural and soft upon touching. Exclusion of EcoSmooth Silk was resulted in less homogeneous perm appearance.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0054">Additionally EcoSmooth Silk was removed from the reducing composition and was added at the same concentration into the oxidizing composition and hair was permed with a reducing composition without EcoSmooth Silk and an oxidizing composition with EcoSmooth Silk. Here again Homogeneous wave appearance was obtained which had excellent elasticity and bounce and improved shine and felt natural and soft upon touching. It should be noted the results were slightly better and preferred compared to the results obtained when EcoSmooth Silk was comprised in reducing composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0055">In a third trial, EcoSmooth Silk was used in both reducing and oxidizing agent whereas the concentrations were halved, i.e. in each composition 0.5% EcoSmooth Silk was used. Homogeneous wave appearance was obtained which had excellent elasticity and bounce and improved shine and felt natural and soft upon touching. When compared the perming efficiency, results obtained with this trial were superior to the previous results described above.</p>
