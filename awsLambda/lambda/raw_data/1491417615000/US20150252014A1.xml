    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">Methods for making epoxidized fatty acid alkyl esters. Such epoxidized fatty acid alkyl esters can be prepared by epoxidizing a natural oil with an acid and a peroxide. Residual acid in the epoxidized natural oil is not neutralized, such as with a base, prior to esterification to produce the epoxidized fatty acid alkyl esters. Epoxidized fatty acid alkyl esters can be employed in plasticizers, either alone or in combination with other plasticizers, such as epoxidized natural oils. Such plasticizers in turn may be used in the formation of polymeric compositions.</p>

      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">Various embodiments of the present invention relate to methods for making epoxidized fatty acid alkyl esters. Such epoxidized fatty acid alkyl esters may be employed as plasticizers or in plasticizer compositions.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Plasticizers are compounds or mixtures of compounds that are added to polymer resins that can lower the modulus and tensile strength, and increase flexibility, elongation, impact strength, and tear strength of the resin (typically a thermoplastic polymer) to which they are added. A plasticizer may also lower the melting point of the polymer resin, which lowers the glass transition temperature and enhances processability of the polymer resin.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Phthalic acid diesters (also known as âphthalatesâ) are commonly used as plasticizers in many flexible polymer products, such as polymer products formed from polyvinyl chloride (âPVCâ) and other vinyl polymers. Examples of phthalate plasticizers include diisononyl phthalate, diallyl phthalate, di-2-ethylhexyl-phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, and diisodecyl phthalate. Other plasticizers used for high temperature applications are trimellitates and adipic polyesters.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Phthalate plasticizers have recently come under intense scrutiny by public interest groups concerned about the negative environmental impact of phthalates and potential adverse health effects in humans (especially children) exposed to phthalates.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">An epoxidized alkyl ester of soybean oil (e.g., epoxidized fatty acid alkyl ester, or âeFAAEâ) can be used as a plasticizer for polyvinyl chloride (âPVCâ) and other polymers (natural rubber, acrylate, etc.) or alternately, it can be used as a primary or secondary plasticizer in a plasticizer blend (such as with epoxidized soybean oil (âeSOâ)). Although advancements have been made, improvements in such plasticizers are still desired.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0011">Various embodiments of the present invention concern methods for preparing eFAAE from natural oils. Such eFAAEs can be employed as a plasticizer alone or in combination with an epoxidized natural oil (âeNOâ). Plasticizers comprising eFAAE and optionally eNO can be employed with a variety of polymeric resins and in making various articles of manufacture.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">Preparing Epoxidized Fatty Acid Alkyl Esters</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0012">The eFAAE can be prepared by first epoxidizing a natural oil. A ânatural oil,â as used herein, is an oil comprising fatty acid triglycerides and derived from a microbe (algae, bacteria), a plant/vegetable, and/or a seed. In an embodiment, natural oil includes genetically-modified natural oil. In another embodiment, the natural oil excludes petroleum-derived oil. Non-limiting examples of suitable natural oils include algae oil, beef tallow oil, canola oil, castor oil, corn oil, fish oil, linseed oil, palm oil, rapeseed oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, tall oil, tung oil, and any combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0013">In an embodiment, the natural oil is soybean oil.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0014">The term âepoxidized natural oil,â as used herein, is a natural oil wherein at least one fatty acid moiety contains at least one epoxide group. Non-limiting examples of suitable eNO include epoxidized algae oil, epoxidized beef tallow oil, epoxidized canola oil, epoxidized castor oil, epoxidized corn oil, epoxidized fish oil, epoxidized linseed oil, epoxidized palm oil, epoxidized rapeseed oil, epoxidized safflower oil, epoxidized soybean oil, epoxidized sunflower oil, epoxidized tall oil, epoxidized tung oil, and any combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0015">In an embodiment, the epoxidized natural oil is an epoxidized soybean oil (âeSOâ).</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0016">In various embodiments, the natural oil is epoxidized by contacting it with an acid and a peroxide to thereby produce an epoxidized reaction mixture comprising an eNO, residual acid, residual peroxide, and water. Thereafter, a portion or at least a portion of the residual acid, residual peroxide, and water is removed from the epoxidized reaction mixture prior to esterifying the eNO to produce the eFAAE, as discussed below.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0017">Suitable acids for use in epoxidizing the natural oil include carboxylic acids, such as formic acid and acetic acid; and peroxycarboxylic acids, such as performic acid and peracetic acid. Catalysts such as mineral acids (e.g., sulfuric acid) and heterogeneous acid resins (e.g., Amberliteâ¢ IR 120H, available from Rohm &amp; Haas) may optionally be employed in the presence of the acid. In an embodiment, the acid employed for epoxidation is formic acid. In an embodiment, the formic acid is employed in the absence of any catalyst.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0018">Suitable peroxides for use in epoxidizing the natural oil include aqueous solutions of hydrogen peroxide, peroxycarboxylic acids, alkyl hydroperoxides, and tertiary hydroperoxides. In an embodiment, the peroxide employed is an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide. In various embodiments, the aqueous solution can be a 30 to 50 volume percent (âvol %â) solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0019">Techniques suitable for removing residual acid, peroxide, and water can comprise layer separation. Layer separation involves separation of an aqueous layer, which contains water, acids, peroxide, and possible traces of oil and esters, from an organic layer containing eNO and eFAME. Following epoxidation, the reaction mixture is allowed to settle and separate into two layers by density difference, and the bottom aqueous layer is disposed of while the top organic layer is processed further to obtain the desired product, as described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0020">Removal of residual acid, peroxide, and water can also include vacuum distillation of the epoxidized reaction mixture. In an embodiment, vacuum distillation can be performed on all or some of the organic layer resulting from the above-described layer separation process. Vacuum distillation can be performed employing any known or hereafter discovered distillation techniques and equipment. In this distillation process, the peroxide, acid, and water are removed as the distillate, while eNO is recovered as the bottom fraction. In an embodiment, vacuum distillation can be performed at a temperature ranging from 40 to 80 degrees Celsius (âÂ° C.â), from 50 to 70Â° C., or at 60Â° C. Additionally, vacuum distillation can be performed under a reduced pressure ranging from 1 to 50 millibar (âmbarâ) (100 to 5,000 pascals (âPaâ)), from 2 to 40 mbar (200 to 4,000 Pa), from 5 to 20 mbar (500 to 2,000 Pa), or at 10 mbar (1,000 Pa). Distillation can be performed for a time ranging from 1 to 5 hours, or from 2 to 3 hours. Additionally, single stage or multi stage distillation may be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0021">Following distillation, the resulting distilled epoxidized reaction mixture can have a water content of less than 0.4 weight percent (âwt %â), less than 0.35 wt %, less than 0.3 wt %, or less than 0.25 wt %, based on the entire weight of the distilled epoxidized reaction mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0022">Following distillation, the resulting distilled epoxidized reaction mixture can have an acid value of less than 1, less than 0.98, less than 0.95, or less than 0.9 milligrams of potassium hydroxide per gram of distilled epoxidized reaction mixture (âmg KOH/gâ). Acid value is determined by titration-based techniques as described in ASTM D664. In a typical procedure, a known amount of sample is dissolved in organic solvent (e.g., isopropanol) and is titrated with a solution of potassium hydroxide with known concentration along with phenolphthalein as a color indicator.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0023">In an embodiment, removal of residual acid from the epoxidized reaction mixture does not include neutralization of the residual acid. The terms âneutralizationâ and âneutralizedâ denote a chemical reaction between an acid and a base to form a salt. Accordingly, in the instant case, removal of residual acid from the epoxidized reaction mixture does not include reacting the residual acid with a base. In other words, in various embodiments, no base is added to the epoxidized reaction mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0024">In an embodiment, removal of residual acid from the epoxidized reaction mixture does not include water washing the reaction mixture or any portion thereof (e.g., an organic layer formed by layer separation, as described above).</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0025">In an embodiment, removal of residual acid from the epoxidized reaction mixture does not include azeotropic distillation.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0026">Following removal of a portion or at least a portion of the residual acid, residual peroxide, and water, the epoxidized natural oil can be transesterified by contact with an alcohol. Alcohols suitable for use in transesterification include C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>8 </sub>monohydric linear alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol, or C<sub>3 </sub>to C<sub>8 </sub>branched alcohols, such as isopropanol, isobutanol, and 2-ethylhexanol. In an embodiment, the alcohol employed for transesterification is methanol. A catalyst may also be employed for transesterification. Catalysts suitable for use in transesterification include homogeneous alkali catalysts, including metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, and sodium ethoxide, or metal hydroxides such as potassium hydroxide (âKOHâ), sodium hydroxide (âNaOHâ), or supported solid alkali catalysts. Other classes of catalysts that may also be employed include acids, acidic resins, double metal cyanide (âDMCâ) catalysts, enzymes, super acids, super bases, metal salts. The catalyst can be in homogeneous or heterogeneous form. In an embodiment, the catalyst employed for transesterification is sodium methoxide solution in methanol.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0027">Depending on the alcohol employed for transesterification, the alkyl moiety of the resulting eFAAE ester may be, for example, a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, or a 2-ethylhexyl group. As used herein, an âepoxidized fatty acid alkyl esterâ is a C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>24 </sub>(saturated or unsaturated) carboxylic acid alkyl ester with at least one epoxide group. An âepoxide groupâ is a three-member cyclic ether (also called oxirane or an alkylene oxide) in which an oxygen atom is joined to each of two carbon atoms that are already bonded to each other. In an embodiment, the eFAAE is an epoxidized fatty acid methyl ester (âeFAMEâ).</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0028">In various embodiments, the eFAAE has an American Public Health Association (âAPHAâ) color index value of less than 100, less than 90, less than 80, less than 70, less than 60, or less than 55. APHA color is determined according to ASTM standards E1209 and E313.</p>

      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="1">Comparative Example 1: Neutralization, Washing, and Vacuum Drying</heading>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0044">Charge 100 g of soybean oil (GEMINIâ¢, available from Cargill) to a reactor along with 13.2 g of formic acid (90% purity, available from S. D. Fine Chemicals). The reaction vessel is a 500-ml three-neck round-bottom flask with variable speed overhead stirrer having a suitable Teflon blade. Immerse the reactor in an oil bath having temperature control for heating/cooling the reactor. The reactor further includes a reflux condenser and a feeding pump for controlled addition of one or more reactants. The reaction can be carried out in batch or semi-batch mode. Preheat the reaction mass to 27-30Â° C., by maintaining the oil bath temperature at 30Â° C. Ensure proper mixing in the reactor by mixing the reaction mixture with an overhead stirrer operated at 400 rpm. Add 82.5 g of 50 wt % hydrogen peroxide (âH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>â 48-52 wt % aqueous solution, available from MERCK) to the reactor at a flow rate of 50 ml/hr with a peristaltic pump. The pump can be operated at constant speed/variable speed to control the reaction exotherm. Maintain temperature of the reaction mixture below 60Â° C. during addition by controlling the addition rate of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Once addition of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is complete, heat the reaction mass to 60Â° C. and allow the reaction to proceed for five hours. At the end of the reaction, subject the reaction mass to layer separation for two hours. During layer separation, the product eNO and unreacted NO are allowed to separate in the form of an upper organic layer while acids, water, and unreacted peroxide separate as a lower aqueous layer. Drain the resulting aqueous layer to separate most of the water and formic acid. Neutralize the organic layer using dilute bicarbonate solution to remove residual formic acid. Prepare a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution by dissolving sodium bicarbonate powder (99% pure, available from Sigma Aldrich) in distilled water which is further diluted in 5 volumes of distilled water to prepare dilute alkali solution for neutralization. 50 mL of this dilute bicarbonate solution is used for neutralization. Thereafter, wash the organic layer with water several times until it becomes neutral. To determine neutrality, the pH of the wash water is measured after each washing using litmus paper and washing is continued until it reaches Ë7. A total 150 mL of wash water is required in five washing steps. For each washing step, 30 mL of distilled water is added in the separating funnel containing the organic layer. The mixture is shaken to ensure adequate contact and allowed to settle. Once clear separation is achieved, the bottom aqueous layer is drained and the top organic layer is washed further. The resulting product contains 0.93 wt % water and has an acid value of 0.85 mg KOH/g. Acid value is determined by titrating the product against 0.1 N KOH in presence of solvent using phenolphthalein as color indicator (ASTM D974). Water content is determined by standard Karl Fischer Titration based method (ASTM D789). Remove residual water under vacuum at Ë10 mbar (1,000 Pascals (âPaâ)) and 60Â° C. for two hours, reducing the water content to 0.31%, while the acid value remains nearly the same (0.82).</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0045">Transesterify this epoxidized product using methanol with sodium methoxide as a catalyst. Mix 44.2 g of epoxidized product with 15 g of methanol (&gt;99% pure, available from Sigma Aldrich) and 1.78 g of 25% sodium methoxide solution in methanol (commercial catalyst solution available from Sigma Aldrich). Perform the reaction at 50Â° C. for two hours. Wash the end product with water after separating glycerol layer from the bottom. Five water washes with 30 mL each are employed to remove the residual catalyst. Wash water is added in the separating funnel containing crude product and shaken. The mixture is allowed to settle into two distinct layers. The bottom aqueous wash water layer is drained while the top organic layer containing eFAME is subjected to further washing steps. Remove traces of water and methanol under vacuum (Ë10 mbar (1,000 Pa) vacuum at 60Â° C.) to obtain the purified product eFAME. The final product properties are provided in Table 1, below.</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="1">Comparative Example 2: Azeotropic Distillation</heading>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0046">Epoxidize 100 g of soybean oil using the protocol described in Comparative Example 1 up to and including the initial layer separation step. Subject the organic layer containing residual formic acid and water to azeotropic distillation. Water forms an azeotrope with methyl ethyl ketone (âMEKâ) at 73.5Â° C. with 89% MEK by weight. Perform azeotropic distillation by adding excess (50 g) MEK (&gt;99% purity, available from Sigma Aldrich) and then distilling off the water-MEK azeotrope at 75 to 80Â° C. with ambient pressure. Analyze product after azeotropic distillation for moisture content and acid value as described above in Comparative Example 1 and compare with the water content and acid value before azeotropic distillation to determine extent of removal. Water content is reduced from 1.82% to 0.4%, while acid value is reduced from 10.32 to 3.6 after azeotropic distillation. This indicates that water removal is 78.01%, while acid removal is 65.12%.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0047">Transesterify 44.2 g of this mixture using methanol with sodium methoxide as a catalyst as described in Comparative Example 1. Additional 0.5% catalyst is required for this reaction because of high acid value, and excessive foaming is observed during reaction. The final product properties are provided in Table 1, below.</p>

Thereafter, subject the organic layer directly to vacuum distillation to remove residual formic acid and water from the reaction mixture. Perform vacuum distillation at 60Â° C. and 10 mbar (1,000 Pa) vacuum for two hours. Analyze bottom product after vacuum distillation for moisture content and acid value, and compare with the moisture content and acid value before distillation to determine extent of removal. Moisture content is reduced from 1.77% to 0.24%, while acid value is reduced from 9.51 to 0.88 after vacuum distillation. This indicates that water removal is 87.2% while acid removal was 91.14%.

      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0050">Epoxidized soybean oil (âeSOâ) samples (prior to esterification) from Examples 1 and 2 are compared to those obtained in Comparative Examples 1 and 2. Key product specifications, such as percent oxirane oxygen and iodine value, are measured to assess the product quality. Oxirane oxygen content is determined according to ASTM D1652. Iodine value is determined according to ASTM D5768. In addition, water content and acid value are obtained to compare the extent of separation achieved by vacuum distillation process as well as for the conventional/other processes. A summary of these product analyses is noted in Table 2, below.</p>
