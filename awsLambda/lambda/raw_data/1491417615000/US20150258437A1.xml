    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">Technologies related to cache-influenced video games are generally described. In some examples, the content of video game outputs as experienced by players of a video game may be adaptively modified to make more effective use of digital assets that are loaded in a computing system cache. Cache-influenced video games may increase cache use by increasing use, within a video game, of digital assets in a cache relative to assets not in the cache, e.g., assets that are on disk or in database storage. Cached digital assets can be retrieved more efficiently than assets stored elsewhere, and therefore video game performance may be improved.</p>

      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application is a continuation under 35 U.S.C. Â§120 of co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/119,171 entitled âCACHE-INFLUENCED VIDEO GAMESâ, filed on Nov. 20, 2013, which is a U.S. National Stage Application filing under 35 U.S.C.

    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Unless otherwise indicated herein, the materials described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Today's video games are often impressive works of audiovisual artistry, in which video game players may encounter digital assets such as buildings, scenery, characters, vehicles, weapons, and the like. Video game players may also be provided with digital assets including short movie-like segments that build context for a game or mission. Digital assets provided to video game players may occasionally be provided in high-definition formats and may furthermore be provided in two dimensional (2D) and/or three dimensional (3D) formats. Providing such digital assets makes extensive use of computer memory resources such as cache and disk or database storage.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Also, video games are increasingly accessed over networks such as the Internet. Video game content, or portions of video game content, including digital assets such as those listed above, may be downloaded and/or streamed to a game player's computing device as the video game is played. In some cases, Massive Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) may allow for multiple video game players to interact with one another, in real-time or otherwise, in environments comprising a same or similar set of digital assets.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Therefore, by way of example, there is an ongoing need in the industry to improve technologies relating to providing digital assets for video games, whether such games are multiplayer games accessed over networks, or otherwise.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The present disclosure generally describes technologies including devices, methods, and computer readable media relating to cache-influenced video games. Cached digital assets can generally be retrieved more efficiently than digital assets stored elsewhere, such as on disk or in a database, and therefore video game performance may be improved by increasing re-use rates of cached digital assets.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Some example methods may comprise providing cache-influenced video games adapted to increase a re-use rate of digital assets in a computing system cache by raising probabilities of using, within the video game, digital assets in the cache relative to digital assets not in the cache. Methods may comprise identifying, by a computing system, one or more digital assets in a cache; adjusting relative probabilities of using, within the video game, digital assets by raising probabilities associated with the digital assets in the cache relative to digital assets not in the cache; selecting digital assets to include in video game outputs using the adjusted relative probabilities of digital assets to increase a re-use rate of digital assets in the cache; and providing video game outputs including the selected digital assets for video game playback.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In some embodiments, cache-influenced video games may comprise multiplayer online games supported by web servers, and the cache accessed by the web servers may comprise a caching tier, e.g., a caching tier in a data center hosting a multiplayer online game. Digital assets loaded in the caching tier for a first player of the multiplayer online game may affect asset selection probabilities for other players of the multiplayer online game, e.g., increasing the probability that digital assets loaded in the caching tier may be selected for inclusion in video game outputs for multiple players. Furthermore, some embodiments may control diversity of video game content, while also benefiting from increased cache use, for example by raising probabilities associated with some digital assets relative to others to diversify digital assets selected to include in video game outputs.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Some example methods may comprise performing cache-influenced video game mission selection. A set of mission input parameters such as a player parameter, a difficulty parameter, and/or a faction parameter may be used to generate multiple different video game missions. Cache performance of the multiple different video game missions may be scored, e.g., by identifying digital assets used by the video game missions, and determining whether the identified digital assets are in a computing system cache. For video game missions comprising multiple different paths, cache performance may be scored for the multiple different paths available within the video game missions. Cache performance scores may be used, optionally along with other criteria such as diversity as appropriate; to select a video game mission from among the multiple different video game missions to increase a re-use rate of digital assets in the cache. The selected video game mission may be provided for video game playback.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Computing devices and computer readable media having instructions implementing the various technologies described herein are also disclosed. Example computer readable media may comprise non-transitory computer readable storage media having computer executable instructions executable by a processor, the instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to carry out any combination of the various methods provided herein.

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the Figures, may be arranged, substituted, combined, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated and made part of this disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The present disclosure is generally drawn, inter alia, to technologies including methods, devices, systems and/or computer readable media deployed therein relating to cache-influenced video games. In some examples, the content of video game outputs as experienced by players of a video game may be adaptively modified to make more effective use of digital assets that are loaded in a computing system cache. Cache-influenced video games may increase cache use by increasing use, within a video game, of digital assets in a cache relative to digital assets not in the cache, e.g., assets that are on disk or in database storage. Cached digital assets can be retrieved more efficiently than digital assets stored elsewhere, and therefore video game performance may be improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Two example technical approaches are disclosed in detail herein, understanding that variations and/or combinations of the disclosed approaches will be appreciated by those of skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure. In a first technical approach, cache-influenced video games may increase cache use by raising probabilities of using digital assets in a cache relative to digital assets not in the cache. In a second technical approach, cache-influenced video games may increase cache use by cache-influenced video game mission selection. Each of these technical approaches is described in further detail herein. Either or both of the disclosed technical approaches may be used in the context of multiplayer online games, or in the context of standalone computing devices that may be, but are not necessarily connected to a network. Disclosed embodiments are generally described in the context of multiplayer online games; understanding that those of skill in the art will appreciate that the teachings of this disclosure may be adapted for use in the context of standalone devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In embodiments according to the first technical approach, cache-influenced video games may increase cache use by raising probabilities of using digital assets in a cache relative to digital assets not in the cache. For example, a video game may include an encounter with a digital asset such as a building, a scenery element such as tree or a fire, a character, a vehicle, a weapon, a short movie segment, or other digital asset. Assume the digital asset to be a character for this example. In situations wherein any of multiple characters might be encountered, the video game may be adapted to use, or may employ a higher probability of using, a character that is present in a cache versus a different character that is not in the cache.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Example methods according to the first technical approach may comprise identifying, by a computing system, one or more digital assets in a cache. When the video game comprises a multiplayer online game, the computing system may comprise one or more web servers, and the cache may comprise a caching tier accessible by the web servers. Digital assets may be loaded in the caching tier for use during play of the multiplayer online game by any of the multiple players thereof. For example, a video game may load a character encountered by a first player in a caching tier. The presence of the character in the caching tier may be identified, which may cause the video game to increase the likelihood of other players also encountering the character as described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Identifying digital assets in a cache may be done by any desired technique. In some embodiments, a direct querying technique may identify digital assets in the cache by querying the cache to retrieve keys corresponding to digital assets in the cache. In some embodiments, a cache-tracking technique may maintain a data structure identifying digital assets in the cache by updating the data structure when digital assets are loaded in the cache, and optionally removing digital assets from the data structure as they age, or occasionally updating the data structure using the direct querying technique.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">After digital assets are identified in a cache, embodiments may adjust relative probabilities of using identified digital assets within the video game. Probabilities of using digital assets identified in the cache may be raised relative to digital assets not in the cache. It will be appreciated that a wide variety of techniques may be used to adjust probabilities of use. In some embodiments, adjusting relative probabilities of digital assets may comprise maintaining an asset probability table identifying digital assets and adjusted relative probabilities of the digital assets. The adjusted relative probabilities may comprise weights, scores, percentages, or any other adjustable variable. In some embodiments, probabilities may be toggled between one and zero to reflect whether a digital asset is, or is not, in the cache. In other embodiments, more complex scoring involving additional probability levels, such as zero, twenty five percent, fifty percent, seventy five percent, and one hundred percent, or anything in between, may be performed, e.g., in embodiments adapted to combine cache based probabilities with other parameters to produce a best overall digital asset selection.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In some embodiments, relative probabilities of digital assets may be additionally adjusted to account for factors other than availability of digital assets in a cache. For example, embodiments may additionally adjust relative probabilities of digital assets to diversify the digital assets provided in video game outputs, e.g., to provide a more diverse and interesting playback experience. Probabilities associated with some digital assets, e.g., digital assets not in the cache, digital assets not recently in the cache, and/or digital assets having low historical usage rates, may be raised relative to other digital assets to diversify digital assets selected for inclusion in video game outputs. Such embodiments may achieve increased cache re-use rates, while simultaneously maintaining diversity of digital assets in video game outputs.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Selecting digital assets to include in video game outputs may use the adjusted relative probabilities of digital assets, thereby effecting an increased re-use rate of digital assets in the cache. Video games may also use any of a wide range of other factors, beyond the presence or absence of a digital asset in a cache, in digital asset selection. Selecting digital assets to include in video game outputs may use cache-based adjusted relative probabilities of digital assets in combination with additional variables such as video game mission/level, player history, player standing, and player skill.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In some scenarios, digital assets within a video game may not be selectableâthat is, the video game may force the use of a particular digital asset. For example, a particular mission or âlevelâ of a video game may involve an encounter with a particular character. Such scenarios need not consult cache-based adjusted relative probabilities.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In some scenarios, digital assets within a video game may be constrained to a limited set of digital asset options. For example, a particular mission or âlevelâ of a video game may involve an encounter with a character selected from a set of ten available characters, so long as the player has not previously encountered the character. Such scenarios may use cache-based adjusted relative probabilities to select a character from the set of available characters as determined by game mission and player history constraints. Player standing, player skill, and/or any other constraints may also be applied in digital asset selection, in combination with cache-based adjusted relative probabilities.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Video game outputs including selected digital assets may be provided for video game playback. For video games accessed online, such as multiplayer video games, video game outputs may be provided by streaming or otherwise transmitting video game outputs to a player terminal via a network. For video games played on standalone computing devices, video game outputs may be provided for example by displaying video game outputs on a display coupled with the computing device.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In embodiments according to the second technical approach, computing systems may provide cache-influenced video games at least in part by performing a cache-influenced video game mission selection process to select video game missions. The cache-influenced video game mission selection process may comprise using a set of mission input parameters to generate multiple different video game missions. Mission input parameters may comprise any one or more parameters used by a video game to generate missions. Mission input parameters may comprise, for example, a map, zone, or environment parameter in which a mission is to occur, a difficulty parameter which may for example be retrieved from player preference settings, a player parameter identifying a particular player or player attributes, and/or a faction parameter identifying a group or team of players, or attributes thereof such as number of players in the faction. Mission input parameters may be tailored to accommodate individual video games and this disclosure is not limited to the example mission input parameters disclosed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In some embodiments, a set of mission input parameters may be included in a mission request, and the mission request may be submitted multiple times to a procedural mission generator. The procedural mission generator may be adapted to use mission templates that have roles to be filled, e.g., for opponents, allies, and locations. The procedural mission generator may be adapted to fill those roles based on mission input parameters. As a practical example, a template selector may pick a template such as âPlayer will navigate to &lt;2 places&gt;, face &lt;2 opponents&gt;, work with &lt;1 ally&gt; and achieve &lt;1 goal&gt;â, where each of the roles of places, opponents, allies, and goals may have labels and/or levels of difficulty associated with them.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The procedural mission generator may generate a video game mission in response to each of the multiple mission requests, thereby generating multiple different video game missions. The generated video game missions may be constrained by the mission input parameters but may otherwise be different from one another, e.g., by selecting different templates and/or populating templates with different selected roles of places, opponents, allies, and goals that in turn make use of different digital assets.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Embodiments may score cache performance of the multiple different generated video game missions at least in part by identifying digital assets used by the video game missions, and determining whether the identified digital assets are in a cache. For example, a list of keys may be generated or retrieved to identify digital assets used by a particular generated mission. The list of keys may be compared to a cache table identifying digital assets stored in a cache. A cache score may comprise a cache re-use rate corresponding to a proportion of digital assets for a mission that are already in a cache. Other techniques for generating cache scores may be applied in some embodiments, and may account for factors such as overall size, e.g., in kilobytes (kB) or Megabytes (MB), of combined digital assets for a mission that are already in a cache and/or overall size of combined digital assets for a mission that are not already in a cache.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In some embodiments, scoring cache performance of a video game mission may comprise scoring cache performance of multiple different paths available within the video game mission. For example, a mission may have multiple different options (paths) which a player may elect to take. The player may encounter different digital assets along each of the different paths. Digital assets may be identified for each path, each path may be scored for cache performance, and cache performance scores of the multiple different paths may be combined to determine an overall cache performance score for a mission. Depending on cache contents and digital assets included in a path, some paths may have âgoodâ cache scores indicating high usage of digital assets already in a cache (high cache re-use rates); while other paths may have âbadâ cache scores with low cache re-use rates. Mission cache performance scoring may comprise scoring cache performance of multiple different paths for example by scoring the multiple different paths within a single mission and, e.g., dividing by the total number of different paths to get an average cache re-use rate indicator for paths included in the mission. Other embodiments may make other combinations of cache performance scores for different paths in a mission as appropriate to score cache performance of video game missions as a whole.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Embodiments may select a video game mission from among the multiple different video game missions using the cache performance scores of the video game missions. For example, in some embodiments, a video game mission having a best cache performance score, corresponding to a highest re-use rate of digital assets in the cache, may be selected. The selected video game mission may be provided for video game playback.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In some embodiments, cache performance scores may be compared to a threshold cache performance score, and any mission having a cache performance score that meets or exceeds the threshold (e.g. by being above or below the threshold cache performance score, depending on the particular implementation) may qualify for selection, while missions having cache performance scores that do not meet or exceed the threshold may be discarded.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In some embodiments, selecting a video game mission may account for additional factors, in combination with the cache performance scores. For example, embodiments may score diversity of video game missions. Diversity scores may be used in combination with cache performance scores to select video game missions. Diversity may be measured, e.g., by comparing digital assets in a video game mission to digital assets previously encountered by a video game player, e.g., by referring to player history information. In some embodiments, diversity may be measured by comparing digital assets in a video game mission with digital assets used in any video game outputs during a given time interval, e.g., a time interval comprising 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, one hour, or other time interval preceding the diversity measurement.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating example player terminals interacting with web servers in a datacenter to play a multiplayer video game, arranged in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> includes a player terminal <b>101</b>, a player terminal <b>102</b>, a network <b>180</b>, and a data center <b>110</b>. Data center <b>110</b> includes a web server <b>111</b>, a web server <b>112</b>, example databases <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>123</b>, and example computing system caches <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>133</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, video game players may operate player terminals <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>, which may comprise, for example, home Personal Computer (PC) systems, video gaming consoles such as consoles sold under the XBOXÂ®, PLAYSTATIONÂ®, and/or NINTENDOÂ® brands, or mobile devices such as smart phones and tablet devices. Player terminals <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> may send video game inputs <b>105</b> to data center <b>110</b>, and may receive video game outputs <b>115</b> from data center <b>110</b>, via network <b>180</b>, such as the Internet. Data center <b>110</b> may comprise, e.g., any group of computing devices adapted to support video game applications. In some embodiments, data center <b>110</b> may be managed by a video gaming company such as BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENTÂ®, maker of the popular multiplayer online video game WORLD OF WARCRAFTÂ®, among others. In some embodiments, data center <b>110</b> may comprise a data center hosting both video game applications and other applications, e.g., a data center supporting AMAZON WEB SERVICESÂ® or other cloud computing services.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Video game inputs <b>105</b> may comprise, e.g., player selections and movement/action information, and video game outputs <b>115</b> may comprise, e.g., digital assets such as scenery, sounds, characters, maps, models, vehicles, and the like, as well as other players' movement/action information. Web servers <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> in data center <b>110</b> may support a video game application (not shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) adapted to process video game inputs <b>105</b>, retrieve digital assets such as digital asset <b>135</b> and digital asset <b>155</b>, and include digital assets <b>135</b> and <b>155</b> in video game outputs <b>115</b>. Web servers <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> may for example retrieve digital asset <b>135</b> from one or more of databases <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>123</b>, e.g., via asset request <b>125</b>. Web servers <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> may for example retrieve digital asset <b>155</b> from one or more of caches <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, and <b>133</b>, e.g., via asset request <b>145</b>. Retrieving digital assets from caches <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, and <b>133</b> is generally faster and less costly than retrieving digital assets from databases <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>123</b>. Therefore, embodiments of this disclosure may be adapted to improve cache re-use rates by increasing inclusion of digital assets such as <b>155</b>, which are stored in caches <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, and <b>133</b>, in video game outputs <b>115</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating example player terminals interacting with a video game application in a datacenter to play a multiplayer video game, arranged in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref>FIG. 2</figref> provides another view of the architecture and interactions described above in connection with <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. Similar to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, <figref>FIG. 2</figref> includes player terminal <b>101</b>, player terminal <b>102</b>, network <b>180</b>, and data center <b>110</b>. In <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, illustrated aspects of data center <b>110</b> include load balancer <b>211</b>, application tier <b>212</b> including video game application <b>213</b>, caching tier <b>214</b> including block <b>215</b>, and database <b>216</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, incoming connections <b>201</b> from player terminals <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are assigned to web servers (not shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) as appropriate by load balancer <b>211</b>. Web servers may support application tier <b>212</b> by hosting applications such as video game application <b>213</b>. Application <b>213</b> may interact with player terminals <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> by receiving video game inputs <b>105</b> and providing video game outputs <b>115</b> to player terminals, e.g., to player terminal <b>101</b>. Applications such as <b>213</b> may retrieve digital assets by asset request/digital asset interactions <b>225</b>, in which digital assets may be requested by application <b>213</b> and requested digital assets may be returned to application <b>213</b>. Asset request/digital asset interactions <b>225</b> may for example request digital assets from a memory subsystem comprising caching tier <b>214</b> and database <b>216</b>. If a requested digital asset is present in caching tier <b>214</b>, the requested digital asset may be returned directly to application <b>213</b> from caching tier <b>214</b>, without an asset request/digital asset interaction <b>226</b> with database <b>216</b>. If a requested digital asset is not present in caching tier <b>214</b>, an asset request/digital asset interaction <b>226</b> with database <b>216</b> may be employed to retrieve the requested digital asset from disk or other storage, which digital asset may be returned to application <b>213</b>. Embodiments of this disclosure may be used with any memory subsystem architecture known in the art or as may be developed.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Caching tier <b>214</b> may comprise one or more types and/or levels of cache. Architectures comprising multiple cache levels, referred to as level 1 cache, level 2 cache, level 3 cache, etc. may be used. Some embodiments may employ a caching architecture referred to as memcached (pronounced Mem-Cache-Dee). Objects requested from database or storage systems may be loaded in, and subsequently retrieved from, memcached. Memcached automatically runs in a distributed fashion storing data by key and content in memory for fast access. Some embodiments may employ a caching architecture referred to as elasticache, such as the cache available through AMAZON WEB SERVICESÂ®.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Datacenter architectures may be divided into a number of tiers, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, and management of the demand and exchanges between those tiers may comprise part of optimizing datacenter <b>110</b> performance. For example, many datacenter architectures may be limited in the speed of their responses by the fetching of data from large storage databases, e.g., database <b>216</b>. This problem may be addressed by the addition of caching tier <b>214</b>. The caching tier <b>214</b> may store data that is accessed repeatedly, providing both better datacenter <b>110</b> performance and reduced database <b>216</b> or storage system load. The gains from caching tier <b>214</b> are often significant. Not only does caching tier <b>214</b> typically return data quickly, speeding up requests that hit caching tier <b>214</b>, but caching tier <b>214</b> reduces database <b>216</b> demand and thus also speeds up requests for digital assets that are not in caching tier <b>214</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Multiplayer online games, and MMOGs in particular, have a number of architectural challenges. One of these is that players expect fast load and response times, but the nature of such video games may include many ârandomâ elements and events, which reduce the leverage available to designers to improve performance with tools like caching tier <b>214</b>. Therefore video game architectures that allow high performance leverage from caching tier <b>214</b> may have a significant effect on performance of video game applications such as <b>213</b>, especially in embodiments wherein video game application <b>213</b> comprises a multiplayer online game or MMOG.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In some embodiments, technologies described herein may modify probabilities of using digital assets such as 3D models, maps, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and/or characters to increase probabilities of reusing digital assets that are present in caching tier <b>214</b>. Embodiments may survey caching tier <b>214</b> and raise probabilities of use for digital assets in caching tier <b>214</b> by altering probabilities used to assign missions and/or otherwise generate video game outputs <b>115</b>, so that video game application <b>213</b> is more likely to generate missions and/or other video game outputs <b>115</b> that have a larger proportion of cache hits. This compares to existing video game mission generation, selection based or procedural, that does not modify probability of digital asset use based on whether digital assets are in caching tier <b>214</b> or not. The benefits of embodiments presented here include better performing video game applications that also cost less to operate, because retrieving digital assets from caching tier <b>214</b> is both faster and cheaper than retrieving digital assets from database <b>216</b> or other storage.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Many of today's video games have intense graphics and interfaces with many moving parts. Supporting robust graphics on desktop and console platforms is comparatively more feasible than on web servers, due to availability of high-density media such as Digital Versatile Disks (DVDs) and also fast read/write speeds provided by local storage and solid state drives. However, robust graphics often push the limits of even fast local storage. Furthermore, as more video games are created to be played on the web, video game applications are challenged to provide video game players with great gaming experiences while minimizing delays waiting for digital assets to be located and accessed from memory subsystems in data centers and other collections of web servers.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In some embodiments, video game application <b>213</b> may comprise a library of mission/quest templates and scripts that may be given to players via various mechanisms like non-player characters (NPCs), âagentâ systems, or journals in which the missions appear. Such missions may include instructions that take players to different places in the game world to face challenges, and the missions themselves may be algorithmically generated either by random selection from a library or pseudo-random algorithmic assembly of game components and their associated digital assets. While this has historically been an architectural weakness in terms of taking advantage of cache, because random digital asset needs generally make poor use of caching tiers, it can also be seen as an opportunity because video game players may not have specific expectations (beyond agent or location context) of what mission may occur next, and so probabilities can be manipulated to the advantage of cache-influenced video game architectures as disclosed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In some embodiments, video game application <b>213</b> may observe the contents of caching tier <b>214</b> to manage missions and digital assets delivered in video game outputs <b>115</b> to player terminals <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>, so as to increase the average cache use, thus improving performance of video game application <b>213</b>. Once digital assets are loaded into caching tier <b>214</b> and thus available rapidly and without storage/database calls, video game application <b>213</b> may increase the probability of usage for those digital assets, e.g. by increasing the probability of a particular mission being offered, populating a mission with digital assets in caching tier <b>214</b>, or by keeping missions within the bounds of terrain that is already loaded in caching tier <b>214</b>. This results in higher performance as more video game application <b>213</b> data requests read from the caching tier <b>214</b> instead of the storage tier, e.g. instead of database <b>216</b>, and also lower costs of operating video game application <b>213</b> due to fewer overall data requests from the storage tier.</p>

Video game application <b>301</b> comprises a survey cache contents component <b>310</b>, a raise probability for assets in cache component <b>320</b> (hereinafter raise probability component <b>320</b>), an asset probability table <b>330</b>, an asset selection component <b>340</b>, an output generator <b>350</b>, other asset selection inputs <b>345</b>, and a content modification engine <b>360</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, survey cache contents component <b>310</b> may be configured to identify digital asset identifiers (IDs) <b>305</b> in caching tier <b>214</b>, e.g. by retrieving digital asset IDs <b>305</b> from caching tier <b>214</b>. Raise probability component <b>320</b> may be adapted to access retrieved digital asset IDs <b>305</b>, and to make probability adjustments <b>315</b> in asset probability table <b>330</b>, e.g., by adjusting probability values in probability table <b>330</b>. Asset probability table <b>330</b> may comprise digital asset IDs <b>305</b>, and optionally also digital asset IDs for digital assets not in caching tier <b>214</b>. In some embodiments, asset probability table <b>330</b> may comprise digital asset IDs for all or substantially all digital assets available for use by video game application <b>301</b>, where the digital asset IDs may be assigned different probability values depending upon their availability in caching tier <b>214</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Asset selection component <b>340</b> may be configured to select digital assets for inclusion in video game outputs. Asset selection component <b>340</b> may be configured to use asset probabilities <b>325</b> retrieved from asset probability table <b>330</b>, optionally along with other asset selection inputs <b>345</b> to select asset IDs <b>335</b>. Asset selection component <b>340</b> may provide asset IDs <b>335</b> to output generator <b>350</b>. Output generator <b>350</b> may generate video game outputs <b>115</b> comprising digital assets identified by asset IDs <b>335</b> as well as other digital assets and video game content as appropriate. Output generator <b>350</b> may retrieve digital assets <b>345</b> identified by asset IDs <b>335</b> from caching tier <b>214</b>, and output generator <b>350</b> may retrieve any other digital assets from storage, e.g., from a database as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> and <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. Video game outputs <b>115</b> may be provided for playback, e.g., by sending video game outputs <b>115</b> to a player terminal In some embodiments, asset IDs <b>335</b> may also be provided to content modification engine <b>360</b>. Content modification engine may be configured to make additional probability adjustments <b>355</b> within asset probability table <b>330</b>, e.g., to diversify the digital assets selected for inclusion in video game outputs <b>115</b> over time.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In some embodiments, survey cache contents component <b>310</b> may be configured to survey cache contents in caching tier <b>214</b>. Survey cache contents component <b>310</b> may directly query caching tier <b>214</b>, and may optionally also maintain a parallel data structure reflecting relevant contents of caching tier <b>214</b>. Raise probability component <b>320</b> may raise probabilities of occurrence within video game outputs <b>115</b> for digital assets that are already in caching tier <b>214</b>, as identified by digital asset IDs <b>305</b>, by modifying asset probability table <b>330</b>. Asset probability table <b>330</b> may literally associate probabilities with digital assets, or may change digital assets probabilities by changing probabilities of adventures or components that make use of digital assets. Asset probability table <b>330</b> may be used by asset selection component <b>340</b> and output generator <b>350</b> to generate video game outputs <b>115</b>, for example by providing asset probabilities <b>325</b> for algorithmic mission selection or generation. Video game outputs <b>115</b> may be delivered to a player terminal, as shown.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Survey cache contents component <b>310</b> and raise probability component <b>320</b> can be implemented in a variety of ways. In some embodiments, digital assets in caching tier <b>214</b> can be identified, e.g., using a memcache.get against a list of keys. For example, the following code may implement components <b>310</b> and <b>320</b> in python, assuming there is a list of relevant keys (in string form) called âall_keysâ, and functions to increase and decrease probability in asset probability table <b>330</b> called, respectively, âincrease_probability_of_assetâ and âdecrease_probability_of_assetâ when given a key as a parameter:</p>

      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0058">The above code, when called, iterates through all_keys, taking each key and checking to see if it is in caching tier <b>214</b>, and then appropriately adjusting corresponding asset probability up or down in asset probability table <b>330</b>. The advantage of such embodiments is robustness as querying the caching tier <b>214</b> is a robust way to know the contents of caching tier <b>214</b>; the disadvantage is that such surveys load the cache to some degree, although it may be kept to a small degree by updating the survey only occasionally.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0059">In some embodiments, survey cache contents component <b>310</b> may be adapted to conduct an initial cache survey, e.g., at the time of cache population. Each memcache.add command may then be paired with the addition of a record of the added key to a dict variable (a dictionary variable that provides a fast hash lookup structure for linked tuples). Such embodiments have the advantage that identification of digital assets in caching tier <b>214</b> need not load the cache. Dict variables may be maintained with information on time-to-live in the cache and appropriate removal of items that are expiring in the cache. In some embodiments, hybrid versions may combine cache surveys which load the cache with the use of updated tracking variables to lengthen the time between surveys.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0060">In some embodiments, asset selection component <b>340</b> and/or output generator <b>350</b> may be configured within and/or in cooperation with a âstory engineâ in video game application <b>301</b>. The story engine may take various variables into account to algorithmically generate ongoing missions. Story engines may accept variables that influence mission or quest generation. Such variables may include, for example, faction and standing of players, player skills and specialties, and even historical aspects like which non-player characters a player may have interacted. In some embodiments, story engines may be modified to accommodate the techniques described herein, e.g., to accept asset probabilities <b>325</b> from asset probability table <b>330</b>, wherein asset probabilities <b>325</b> are effective to adjust generated missions to make better use of caching tier <b>214</b>. For example, if models and AI for particular monsters are already in caching tier <b>214</b>, then encounters with such models and AI can be made more common by the use of asset probabilities <b>325</b>. If a particular region is well represented in caching tier <b>214</b>, for example, missions may be preferentially directed toward or through that region.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0061">In some embodiments, video game outputs <b>115</b> may include digital assets loaded in caching tier <b>214</b> prior to asset selection by asset selection component <b>340</b>, such as digital assets identified by digital asset IDs <b>305</b>, and also other digital assets which may be loaded into caching tier <b>214</b> after asset selection, e.g., for the purpose of generating all aspects of video game outputs <b>115</b>. Generation and delivery of video game outputs <b>115</b> may therefore result in alterations to caching tier <b>214</b>, e.g., as video game players roam outside cached regions, adventure scripts dictate changes, or random content generation does not align with digital assets already in caching tier <b>214</b>. Such alterations may modify cache contents over time, resulting in eventual identification of different digital asset IDs as digital asset IDs <b>305</b> through continued operation of survey cache contents component <b>310</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0062">The presence of newly loaded digital assets in caching tier <b>214</b> may affect digital asset IDs subsequently retrieved by survey cache contents component <b>310</b>, thereby shifting the probabilities in asset probability table <b>330</b> and optionally leading to gradual turnover of digital assets selected by asset selection component <b>340</b>. In some embodiments, content modification engine <b>360</b> may be adapted to adjust probabilities in asset probability table <b>330</b> to promote and/or guarantee such cache turnover of digital assets in caching tier <b>214</b>. Content modification engine <b>360</b> may for example explicitly alter asset probabilities over time to ensure a minimum diversity of digital assets included in video game outputs <b>115</b>, or to provide digital assets matched to changing player audiences over time.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0063">Regarding content modification engine <b>360</b> in general, one possible side effect of increasing cache re-use rates, applicable in some scenarios, is that video game application <b>301</b> may re-circulate video game players into smaller areas and engage video game players in an overall smaller selection of digital assets due to the increased probability of using missions and digital assets that select from a finite caching tier. Large caches and large player and mission populations may produce enough new cache tier content to generate a virtuous cycle of changing cache content, however there is also a danger that, in some embodiments, increased probability of use of content in caching tiers may lead to over-use of limited content in a manner that degrades player satisfaction. Thus embodiments may control content diversity in combination with increasing cache re-use rates. It will be appreciated, with the benefit of this disclosure, that a variety of technical approaches for controlling content diversity may be used. Content modification engine <b>360</b> illustrates an example approach.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0064">In some embodiments, content modification engine <b>360</b> may enhance content diversity by adjusting values in probability table <b>330</b> to influence asset selection <b>340</b>. For example, content modification engine <b>360</b> may periodically adjust probability values associated with a fraction of the low probability value digital assets in probability table <b>330</b> to instead have high probability values. Such adjustments may result in a chain reaction leading to increased use of such newly high probability value digital assets. For example, such high probability value digital assets may be selected by asset selection <b>340</b>, loaded in caching tier <b>214</b> for use by output generator <b>350</b>, identified by survey cache contents component <b>210</b> among digital asset IDs <b>305</b>, and assigned higher probability values in asset probability table <b>330</b> by raise probability component <b>320</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0065">Content modification engine <b>360</b> may adjust probability values of any fraction of digital assets in probability table <b>330</b>, at any frequency. In some embodiments, content modification engine <b>360</b> may make adjustments adaptively to reach a targeted rate of change in contents of caching tier <b>214</b>, digital asset IDs <b>305</b>, and/or asset IDs <b>335</b> over time. By targeting a rate of change over time, content modification engine <b>360</b> may use a metric that refreshes cache content and applies across many different player populations. For example, a rate of change of 5% per ten minutes would, on average, swap out cache content about every two hours. Content modification engine <b>360</b> may target any rate of cache change, e.g., from 1% to 99% per time interval, which interval may be, e.g., per minute, multiple minute, hour or multiple hour period.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0066">Content modification engine <b>360</b> may make adjustments adaptively to reach a targeted rate of change, e.g., by measuring a rate of change in caching tier <b>214</b>, digital asset IDs <b>305</b>, and/or asset IDs <b>335</b>, and selecting a number of digital assets for probability value adjustment based on the measured rate of change. When the measured rate of change is at or above a targeted rate of change, e.g., at or above 5% per ten minutes, the content modification engine <b>360</b> may take no action as the targeted rate of change is already occurring naturally. When the measured rate of change is below the targeted rate of change, e.g., below 5% per ten minutes, the content modification engine <b>360</b> may select a number of digital assets for probability value adjustment, which selected number may grow with the difference between the measured and targeted rate of change.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0067">In some embodiments, content diversity may be promoted, e.g., by operation of asset selection component <b>340</b>. Operations of asset selection component <b>340</b> may be combined with, or independent of, operations of content modification engine <b>360</b>. In some embodiments, asset selection module <b>340</b> may for example employ âunmodifiedâ mission selection/digital asset selection for a fraction of missions/digital asset selections. Unmodified selection may not account for probability values in asset probability table <b>330</b>, thereby effecting a controlled increase in the number digital assets in video game outputs <b>115</b> that are not in caching tier <b>214</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0068">In some embodiments, asset selection module <b>340</b> may be configured to keep and/or access records of missions and/or digital assets encountered by each player, and asset selection module <b>340</b> may select content that players have not encountered, or have not ârecentlyâ encountered, as determined through the use of any desired time interval, even though when asset selection results in selection of digital assets with worse cache performance scores. Such embodiments may engage in selecting digital assets from outside of caching tier <b>214</b>, and subsequent loading of selected digital assets in caching tier <b>214</b>, when the retrieval/loading of new digital assets in caching tier <b>214</b> may be most effective from a player experience standpoint, while still refreshing the caching tier <b>214</b> over time.</p>

Web server <b>111</b> comprises a computer readable medium <b>400</b>, and computer readable medium <b>400</b> comprises an example video game application <b>401</b>. Video game application <b>401</b> is another example embodiment of video game application <b>213</b> in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, wherein video game application <b>401</b> may generally implement the second technological approach described herein. Video game application <b>401</b> comprises mission input parameters <b>405</b>, a procedural mission generator <b>410</b>, multiple missions <b>415</b>, a path evaluator <b>420</b>, and a cache scorer <b>430</b>. Video game application <b>401</b> also comprises survey cache contents component <b>310</b> and a cache table <b>440</b>.

      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0070">In <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, survey cache contents component <b>310</b> may be configured to retrieve digital asset identifiers (IDs) <b>305</b> from caching tier <b>214</b>, as described with reference to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. Retrieved digital asset IDs <b>305</b> may be placed in cache table <b>440</b>. In some embodiments, digital asset IDs other than digital asset IDs <b>305</b> may be removed from cache table <b>440</b>. In some embodiments, cache table <b>440</b> may comprise, e.g., IDs for all digital assets available for use by video game application <b>401</b>, with data indicating which digital assets in cache table <b>440</b> are present in caching tier <b>214</b>. In some embodiments, cache table <b>440</b> may be implemented similarly to asset probability table <b>330</b>, described with reference to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0071">Video game application <b>401</b> may generate mission input parameters, e.g., in response to a received video game input requesting a new mission. Video game application <b>401</b> may submit mission input parameters <b>405</b> to procedural mission generator <b>410</b>. In some embodiments, video game application <b>401</b> may be adapted to submit mission input parameters <b>405</b> multiple times, to cause procedural mission generator <b>410</b> to generate multiple missions <b>415</b>. In some embodiments, procedural mission generator <b>410</b> may be adapted to automatically generate multiple missions <b>415</b> in response to a mission request comprising mission input parameters <b>405</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0072">In some embodiments, procedural mission generator <b>410</b> may be configured to operate at least in part according to a fill-in-the-blanks model. Procedural mission generator <b>410</b> may for example pick a template that has roles to be filled for opponents, allies, and locations, and may select digital assets to fill those roles based on specific qualities. For example, a template selector may pick a template such as, âPlayer will navigate to &lt;2 places&gt;, face &lt;2 opponents&gt;, work with &lt;1 ally&gt; and achieve &lt;1 goal&gt;â, where each of the roles of places, opponents, allies, and goals may have labels and/or levels of difficulty associated with them. Procedural mission generator <b>410</b> may query a database with the properties of each of the places, opponents, allies, goals, etc. to fill in the details. Since generating procedural missions may comprise a lightweight activity including a few database calls, solutions may provide effective processes by generating multiple differently populated procedural scenarios, i.e., multiple missions <b>415</b>, and evaluating each one, including conducting path evaluation as appropriate to account for different paths or locations that may be traversed and/or visited during a mission.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0073">In some embodiments, each of multiple missions <b>415</b> may be processed by path evaluator <b>420</b>. Path evaluator <b>420</b> may be configured to identify digital assets used in each of multiple missions <b>415</b>. Path evaluator <b>420</b> may be âpath blindâ by identifying digital assets regardless of their use in different paths within a mission, or âpath awareâ by identifying digital assets within a mission on a per-path basis. In some embodiments, path evaluator <b>420</b> may be configured to estimate a path, e.g., from among multiple path options in a mission, and to identify digital assets used in the estimated path.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0074">Digital asset IDs <b>425</b> for each of multiple missions <b>415</b> may be submitted to cache scorer <b>430</b>. In âpath awareâ embodiments, digital asset IDs <b>425</b> may be accompanied by path information. Cache scorer <b>430</b> may score each of multiple missions <b>415</b>, and may optionally score different paths within a mission, by determining a cache re-use rate for each mission. There are a wide variety of approaches that may be used to determine cache re-use rates, and this disclosure is not limited to any particular approach. In general, approaches for determining cache re-use rates may determine which of digital asset IDs <b>425</b> overlap with digital asset IDs <b>305</b>. In other words, approaches for determining cache re-use rates may determine which of digital asset IDs <b>425</b> are present in caching tier <b>214</b>. Digital asset IDs <b>445</b> may therefore comprise, e.g., the digital asset IDs that are present in both of digital asset IDs <b>425</b> and digital asset IDs <b>305</b>. In some embodiments, the number of IDs present in digital asset IDs <b>445</b>, the proportion of digital asset IDs <b>445</b> to digital asset IDs <b>425</b>, the combined size of digital assets represented by digital asset IDs <b>445</b>, and/or any other metric may be generated by cache scorer <b>430</b> as a cache score to assess cache re-use rates of each of the multiple missions <b>415</b>. In some embodiments, e.g., when cache scores for multiple missions <b>415</b> are not acceptable, cache scorer <b>430</b> may be adapted to re-initiate procedural mission generator <b>410</b> to generate further missions using mission input parameters <b>405</b>, which further missions may be scored as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0075">In some embodiments, cache scorer <b>430</b> may provide mission cache scores <b>435</b> to mission selection component <b>450</b>.

Any of a variety of approaches may be used to identify digital assets in a cache. For example, in some embodiments, block <b>601</b> may comprise querying the cache to retrieve keys corresponding to digital assets in the cache. In some embodiments, block <b>601</b> may comprise maintaining a data structure identifying digital assets in the cache by updating the data structure when digital assets are loaded in the cache.

Probabilities of using digital assets may be adjusted by raising probabilities associated with digital assets in the cache relative to digital assets not in the cache. Any approach for adjusting probabilities may be used, and different approaches may be tailored to have any desired impact on digital asset selection, e.g., ranging from a relatively small effect, with minimal difference between a cache-influenced video game and a non-cache-influenced video game, to a relatively large effect, with significant differences between a cache-influenced video game and a non-cache-influenced video game. Example approaches for adjusting relative probabilities of digital assets may comprise maintaining an asset probability table identifying digital assets, adjusting relative probabilities in the asset probability table.

Methods according to <figref>FIG. 7</figref> may select missions that make more use of digital assets, such as characters, buildings, scenery, etc., that are stored in a computing system cache than other missions that make less use of digital assets stored in the cache.</p>

Furthermore, computing device <b>500</b> may maintain a cache table comprising IDs for currently cached digital assets. Block <b>701</b> may be performed in a manner to continuously, periodically, or otherwise repeatedly update the cache table over time, so that the cache table remains substantially current. The cache table may be useful for example in scoring mission cache performance, described below with reference to block <b>703</b>. Block <b>701</b> may be followed by block <b>702</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0098">At a âGenerate Multiple Missionsâ block <b>702</b>, computing device <b>500</b> may use a set of mission input parameters to generate multiple different video game missions. In some embodiments, block <b>702</b> may comprise submitting multiple mission requests to a procedural mission generator in video game <b>401</b>. In some embodiments, each of the multiple mission requests may comprise a same set of mission input parameters. Also, the broader goal of generating multiple missions and selecting a mission based on cache performance may be met in some embodiments without necessarily using a same set of mission input parameters. For example, some embodiments may use modified mission input parameters for generating the multiple different video game missions. Block <b>702</b> may be followed by block <b>703</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0099">At a âScore Cache Performance of Missionsâ block <b>703</b>, computing device <b>500</b> may score cache performance of the multiple different video game missions generated at block <b>702</b>. Scoring cache performance at block <b>703</b> may be accomplished according to a wide variety of different techniques. Scoring may comprise, at least in part, identifying digital assets used by the video game missions, and determining whether the identified digital assets are in a cache. For example, a retrieved or generated list of digital assets included in a mission may be compared against a cache table maintained at block <b>701</b>, to determine whether the listed digital assets are in the cache. Some embodiments may account for factors such as overall number, percentage, or combined size of digital assets are in the cache. Some embodiments may account for type of cache, e.g., levels of cache in which digital assets are loaded. Some embodiments may score cache performance of multiple different paths available within the video game missions, or calculate a most common or most likely path, and score the calculated path. Block <b>703</b> may be followed by block <b>704</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0100">At a âScore Diversityâ block <b>704</b>, computing device <b>500</b> may score diversity of the multiple different video game missions generated at block <b>702</b>. For example, in some embodiments, computing device <b>500</b> may compare digital assets in missions against a player history list identifying digital assets previously encountered by a video game player. Here, a low number of matches would indicate a higher diversity score (higher diversity); while a high number of matches would indicate lower diversity. In another example, computing device <b>500</b> may assign each digital asset in a mission a diversity variable such as an amount of time since the digital asset was previously included in a video game output, and diversity variables may be summed, or otherwise combined, for missions to calculate a diversity scores for the missions. Diversity scores may optionally be used in addition to cache performance scores during mission selection at block <b>705</b>. Block <b>704</b> may be followed by block <b>705</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0101">At a âMission Selectionâ block <b>705</b>, computing device <b>500</b> may select a video game mission from among the multiple different video game missions generated at block <b>702</b>. Mission selection may use, inter alia, cache performance scores generated at block <b>703</b>, for the video game missions generated at block <b>702</b>, to select the video game mission. By selecting missions using cache performance scores, video game <b>401</b> may increase a re-use rate of digital assets in the cache.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0102">Cache performance scores may be used for mission selection in a variety of different ways. In some embodiments, cache performance scores may be compared to a threshold cache performance score. For example, any cache performance score showing a threshold re-use rate, or better, may be considered an acceptable candidate for selection. In the absence of any missions having threshold re-use rates or better, embodiments may be adapted to return to block <b>702</b> to generate additional missions for scoring. In some embodiments, cache performance scores for the multiple generated missions from block <b>702</b> may be compared against each other, and a mission having a âbestâ the cache performance score (e.g. highest re-use rate) may be selected.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0103">Embodiments may also use diversity scores in mission selection at block <b>705</b>. For example, some embodiments may identify a set of missions having at least a threshold cache performance score, as described above, and then select a mission within the identified set having a highest (or most diverse) diversity score. Some embodiments may combine cache performance and diversity scoring, and select a mission having a best overall combined score. Block <b>705</b> may be followed by block <b>706</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0104">At a âProvide Video Game Outputsâ block <b>706</b>, computing device <b>500</b> may provide a selected video game mission for video game playback. For example, computing device <b>500</b> may stream video game outputs comprising a selected mission to a player terminal via a network.
