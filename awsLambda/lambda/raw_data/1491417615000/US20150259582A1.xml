      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The compositions relate to polyol materials. The polyols are polymeric acid or hydroxyl terminated materials that are end capped. The polymer polyols can be used with a reactive curing agent such as an isocyanate compounds or used in formulated curable adhesives.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In the preparation of polyether and polyester polyol materials, and particularly in the manufacture of polyester materials, control of acid number, hydroxyl number, reaction conditions and molecular weight can be important in order to increase polyol productivity. Improved polyol materials can also produce improved adhesive properties in the formulated curable adhesive materials, including urethane adhesives.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">While a number of polyether and polyester polyols have been formulated, a substantial need still exists in obtaining improved polyether and polyester polyol preparation or processing that can improve manufacturing efficiency, control of acid number or hydroxyl number and molecular weight. A further need exists to obtain improved adhesive properties in a final adhesive formulation.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BRIEF DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">We have found that the use of a glycidyl ether or ester compound as a capping agent can improve the manufacture of and the properties of polymer polyol compounds. Capped polyol compositions of the disclosure are substantially linear polyether or polyester polyols with an acid number equal to or less than about 2 or a hydroxyl number equal to or greater than 10 shows improved properties when used in curable (i.e.) polyurethane adhesive materials. The capped polyols when used with suitable isocyanate reactive compounds produce improved adhesive strength in bonding particularly low surface energy materials such as polyolefins and ABS resins.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The processes for manufacturing the polyol compositions and specifically polyester polyol materials are improved in terms of efficiency and yield.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Polyether polyols are typically made by polymerizing alkylene oxide materials to form substantially linear polymers.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Polyester polyols can be made by polymerizing multifunctional aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids (two or more carboxylic groups) with a multifunctional aliphatic or aromatic alcohol (two or more hydroxyl groups) compounds resulting in polyester materials having residual acidic or hydroxyl functionality, measured by acid number or hydroxyl number. Lower alcohol esters of the carboxylic acids can be used in the poly-esterification.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">We have found that useful precursor polyester polyol materials having an acid number or hydroxyl number of about 5 to 30 can be reacted with a glycidyl compound. The amount of glycidyl compound is used that reacts with residual active hydrogen (acid or hydroxyl) to cap the polymer and complete the reaction but leaving sufficient hydroxyl to be useful in a reaction with isocyanate. The use of the glycidyl compound can also provide the manufacture of the polyol material with molecular weight control and improved adhesive properties. In the polyester, the mole ratio of hydroxyl:carboxyl (—OH:—CO<sub>2</sub>H) can be 1.2:1 to 0.8:1 or 1.1:1 to 0.9:1. The molecular weight (M<sub>n</sub>) of the capped material is greater than 500 and is often 1000 to 16000 or 2000 to 4000.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">We have further found in manufacture of polyester polyols particularly from dicarboxylic acids and di-hydroxyl compounds that the glycidyl ester compound can be used to substantially reduce manufacturing time, control molecular weight and improve the properties of the resulting adhesive materials. The use of the glycidyl capping agent results in reduced reaction time and increased productivity. The glycidyl compound permits the reaction to end before all consuming the maximum amount of the reactants. As the concentration of the reactants is reduced by the esterification, the reaction rate slows. At this point, if the molecular weight is sufficient, the glycidyl agent can be used to react with remaining active hydrogen compound to compete the synthesis. Molecular weights are measured as number average (M<sub>n</sub>). In this way the reaction does not need to be driven to completion. Amounts of materials are selected such that the hydroxyl or acid number of the finished materials is sufficient to react with (e.g.) an isocyanate compound in a formulated adhesive.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DISCUSSION</heading>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In a first aspect of the invention is a generic polymeric polyol precursor compound having an acid number or a hydroxyl number of about 5 to 30 that can be reacted with a glycidyl compound resulting in end cap of the polyol.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In another aspect of the invention, a polyether polyol can be manufactured by reacting a poly alkylene oxide polyol with the glycidyl compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In a further aspect of the invention, a polyester polyol can be reacted with the glycidyl compound of the invention. Substantially linear polyester polyols of dicarboxylic acids and di hydroxyl compound can be made with useful molecular weight and reactivity. In a still further aspect of the invention, the capping agent can be used in a method for the manufacturer of a polyester polyol using substantially linear polyester polyols of dicarboxylic acids and di hydroxyl compound such as an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid, and aliphatic dihydroxy compound in order to form a preliminary polyester reaction product. When that reaction product achieves molecular weight of at least 500 or at least 2000, an acid number of 5 to100 or, the precursor reaction product can be reacted with the glycidyl compound such as a glycidyl ester compound to complete the reaction and form the finished capped polymeric polyol material. In this way the reaction does not have to be forced to completion as the concentration of the acid and hydroxyl reactants are reduced. The amount of glycidyl compound is selected to react with acid and hydroxyl functionality leaving a finished material with an acid number (less than or equal to 2 or less than 1) or hydroxyl number (less than 6 or less than 12 or less than 112) and a residual glycidyl content of less than 0.1%, 0.05 or 0.02% for further use such as in a urethane adhesive. Since the use of the glycidyl ester compound then reacts with available acid and hydroxyl material in the reaction product, then the polyol synthesis is rapidly brought to completion much sooner than if left to simply finish by the esterification polymerization.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The invention is also directed to capped polymeric polyester polyol comprising the reaction product of a polyester polyol having a molecular weight greater than about 500. The hydroxyl number can be consistent with the levels disclosed herein. The glycidyl compound can have a formula:</p>

      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0024">One useful class of polyester polyols are manufactured by the direct poly-esterification of high-purity diacids (or lower alcohol esters) and glycols, such as adipic acid and 1,4-butanediol at elevated temperature until the desired molecular weight (about500 to 8000) is achieved. Polyester polyols are usually more expensive and more viscous than polyether polyols, but they make polyurethanes with better solvent, abrasion, and cut resistance. Other polyester polyols are based on trans-esterification (glycolysis) of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) or dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) with glycols such as diethylene glycol.</p>

The order of addition and the amounts of each oxide affect many polyol properties, such as compatibility, water-solubility, and reactivity. Polyols made with only propylene oxide are terminated with secondary hydroxyl groups and are less reactive than polyols capped with ethylene oxide, which contain a higher percentage of primary hydroxyl groups.</p>

      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0000">represents a residue of the acid functionality of a polyester polyol. The glycidyl reaction creates secondary hydroxyls or primary hydroxyls depending on the presence of catalyst that can react in a urethane adhesive. Amounts of materials are selected such that the hydroxyl or carboxylic acid functionality is fully reacted and made derivative by a matching amount of glycidyl compound. At the end of the reaction little or no free carboxylic acid, epoxy or glycidyl functionality should be detected.</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="2">Adhesive Technology</heading>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0030">The remaining active hydrogen groups, primarily hydroxyl groups, in the capped polyols can be used to formulate curing adhesives. Any curing agent that can react with the active hydrogen or hydroxyl can be used in an adhesive. Useful adhesives are urethane and epoxy materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0031">Polyurethanes are produced by reacting an isocyanate containing two or more isocyanate groups with a polyol containing on average two or more hydroxyl groups per molecule typically in the presence of a catalyst.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0032">Isocyanates are very reactive materials. Aromatic isocyanates, diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) or toluene diisocyanate (TDI) are more reactive than aliphatic isocyanates, such as hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) or isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). Isocyanates are difunctional; two isocyanate groups per molecule. An important exception to this is polymeric diphenyl methane diisocyanate, which is a mixture of molecules with two-, three-, and four- or more isocyanate groups. In cases like this the material has an average functionality greater than two, commonly 2.7.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0033">The capped polyols of the disclosure that are used to make polyurethane adhesives are not “pure” compounds since they are often mixtures of similar molecules with different molecular weights and mixtures of molecules that contain different numbers of hydroxyl groups, which is why the “average functionality” is often mentioned. The polymerization reaction makes a polymer containing the urethane linkage, —RNHCOOR′— and is catalyzed by tertiary amines, such as 1,4-diazabicyclo [2.2.2] octane (also called DABCO or TEDA), DMDEE (2,2′-dimorpholino diethyl ether) and metallic compounds, such as dibutyltin dilaurate or bismuth octanoate.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0034">Aliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanates are used in smaller volumes, most often in coatings and other applications where color and transparency are important. The most important aliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanates are 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), 1-isocyanato-3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl-cyclohexane (isophorone diisocyanate, IPDI), and 4,4′-diisocyanato dicyclohexyl methane, (H<sub>12</sub>MDI or hydrogenated MDI).</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0035">Chain extenders are low molecular weight hydroxyl and amine terminated compounds that play an important role in the polymer morphology. The choice of chain extender also determines flexural, heat, and chemical resistance properties. The most important chain extenders are ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO or BDO), 1,6-hexanediol, cyclohexane dimethanol and hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (HQEE).</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0036">Polyurethane catalysts can be classified into two broad categories, amine compounds and metal complexes. Traditional amine catalysts have been tertiary amines such as triethylene diamine (TEDA, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane or DABCO), dimethyl cyclohexylamine (DMCHA), and dimethyl ethanolamine (DMEA). Tertiary amine catalysts are selected based on whether they drive the urethane (polyol+isocyanate, or gel) reaction or the isocyanate trimerization reaction (e.g., using potassium acetate, to form isocyanurate ring structure). Catalysts that contain a hydroxyl group or secondary amine, which react into the polymer matrix, can replace traditional catalysts thereby reducing the amount of amine that can come out of the polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0037">Suitable additives for use in the present invention may be any compound which will not interfere with the efficacy of the other components in the adhesive composition and which increases adhesion. Suitable additives include, but are not limited to, reactive or non-reactive polymers, fillers, plasticizers, viscosity control agents, defoamers and stabilizers.</p>
      <heading id="h-00015-en" level="2">Exemplary Section</heading>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0038">The following examples and data (reflected in the figures of the conversion of the materials into polyester) show the utility of the processes of the invention in obtaining high quality polyol materials for use in the compositions of the disclosure. The preparations are exemplary of the aspect of the invention using polyester polyol materials but should not be used in unduly limiting the scope of the claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0039">In the following polymerization reactions followed by the capping reaction, the reactants are combined in a conventional oil jacketed heated polyester reactor vessel equipped with a nitrogen bubbler that acts to remove volatile materials such a reaction byproduct water, reduce color formation and agitate the mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0040">In the formation of the capped polyester polyol, the dicarboxylic acid and the dihydroxyl compound is added to the vessel and heated to 140° C. Water a byproduct of esterification is formed and removed by nitrogen. After water generation slows, the temperature is gradually increased to 220° C. and the reaction is continued until the acid number falls to less than 20 preferable less than 10. At this point the molecular weight is greater than about 3000.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0041">The reaction mixture is cooled and the glycidyl ester is then added to react with remaining acid groups. The reaction is heated to 140-190° C. This reaction forms secondary or primary hydroxyl groups with glycidyl ring opening.</p>

      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0044">753 g of 1,6-hexanediol (for polyester 9, 11, 15, 16L and 16R) and 900 g of adipic acid were reacted under a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature in the range from 140 to 200° C. After water which had been formed in the reaction had been removed by distillation, the temperature was increased to range from 200-230° C. After the acid number had fallen to the expected data, the reaction was stopped. Then we measured the acid number and viscosity.</p>

      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0063">Comp. Ex. and Examples 1 and 2 are same percentage but Comp. Ex. is with straight molecular weight hexane-adipic acid polyester polyol Ex. 1 is with Polyester 11 (with 3-4% Cardura) and Ex. 2 is with 10% Cardura capped polyester polyols. In the case of 22% polyester polyols in the formula, with low level Cardura (3-4%), the physical property are almost the same as regular polyester polyol. With higher Cardura, the finished viscosity is a little lower but with longer open time, which is because the Cardura use reduces the crystalline behavior. Lower viscosity and longer open time are often desired in process or in application.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0064">As can be seen in the tables of data, the processes using the compositions disclosed above produce quality polyester polyol materials in a shortened period of time with substantially complete conversion to a useful polyol material with minimal residual acid or hydroxyl minimal residual acid functionality. The hydroxyl functionality of the polyol remains since in the reaction between the glycidyl ether or glycidyl ester materials and the polyol a new hydroxyl group is formed in the reaction that remains available for reaction with the isocyanate compound in a urethane adhesive.</p>
