      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">A Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-208699 filed on September 21, the content of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a curable silicone which yields a cured product with excellent transparency and high refringency and a semiconductor sealing material and optical semiconductor device using the same.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Curable silicone compositions are used as sealants for LEDs, raw materials for lenses, and the like due to their excellence in transparency and heat resistance. In order to increase the refractive index of a cured product, an aryl group such as a phenyl group or a naphthyl group is typically introduced into an organopolysiloxane serving as a structural component. For example, organopolysiloxanes having a condensed polycyclic aromatic group such as a naphthyl group, an anthracenyl group, or a phenanthryl group as a T unitâthat is, as R in a siloxane represented by the general formula: RSiO<sub>3/2</sub>âare proposed in Patent Documents 1 to 4. However, such organopolysiloxanes do not form cured products with a high refractive index, high transparency, or excellent heat resistance as a result of a hydrosilylation reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In addition, an organopolysiloxane having a condensed polycyclic aromatic group such as a naphthyl group, an anthracenyl group, or a phenanthryl group as a D unitâthat is, as R in a siloxane represented by the general formula: R<sup>2</sup>SiO<sub>2/2 </sub>is proposed in Patent Document 5. However, such an organopolysiloxane has the problem that the cured product typically becomes hard and brittle as the refractive index of the cured product is increased, and the mechanical characteristics and heat resistance of the cured product are diminished as a result.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In order to solve these problems, in Patent Document 6, the present applicants proposed a curable silicone composition in which at least 50 mol % of the R moieties in a siloxane represented by RSiO<sub>3/2 </sub>are condensed polycyclic aromatic groups such as naphthyl groups or groups containing condensed polycyclic aromatic groups and which form a cured product with a high refractive index, high transparency, and excellent heat resistance when cured by a hydrosilylation reaction as a result of regulating the content of the siloxane units. However, although the addition of various fluorescent materials and inorganic fillers such as silica is described in this document, there is no mention or suggestion of the surface treatment thereof. Further, there is no mention or suggestion of further improving the refractive index by using metal oxide microparticles with a high refractive index.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">On the other hand, in optical material applications such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), metal oxide microparticles have been used in recent years to secure or improve the function of the light-emitting diodes. However, since metal oxide microparticles have high surface hydrophilicity in the untreated state, the microparticles may aggregate and cause poor dispersion of other hydrophobic resins or the like into the matrix. In particular, metal oxide microparticles having a high refractive index and a particle size so small that light scattering can be ignored are useful for obtaining optical materials with a high refractive index, but it is difficult to finely and stably disperse these optical fine members into silicone resins with high hydrophobicity. Therefore, several treatment methods have been proposed in order to solve these problems (see Patent Documents 7 to 11).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">However, known surface treatment agents for optical materials do not comprise a specific functional group bonded to silicon and a siloxane portion, and the surface treatment performance thereof is not satisfactory. Further, the siloxane portion of a known surface treatment agent primarily consists of a silane or a dimethyl silicone portion with a low refractive index, and there is no mention or suggestion of a surface treatment agent or the concept of a surface treatment agent which itself has a high refractive index. In addition, there is no mention or suggestion in the documents describing these known surface treatment agents regarding surface treatment agents which have a specific functional group, have a high overall refractive index, and have a functional group which is reactive with hydrophobic resins.</p>

      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0059">The metal oxide microparticles serving as component (B) are a characteristic component of the present invention. Since the microparticles have a high refractive index and are so small that light scattering can be ignored, the microparticles can further improve the refractive index and transparency of the resulting silicone cured product. In particular, these metal oxide microparticles have an even higher refractive index than phenyl-modified silicone or naphthyl-modified silicone cured products, as described below, so a cured product with a refractive index of at least 1.5.5 after curing can be obtained relatively easily.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0060">The cumulant average particle size of such metal oxide microparticles is at most 500 nm, particularly preferably from 1 to 200 nm, and even more preferably from 1 to 150 nm from the perspective of the transparency of a silicone cured product containing the particles. Further, with the objective of improving the optical, electromagnetic, and mechanical characteristics of optical materials, these metal oxide microparticles may beâand are preferablyânanocrystalline particles or semiconductor nanocrystalline particles with a crystal diameter of from 10 to 100 nm. On the other hand, when the average particle size of the metal oxide microparticles exceeds the upper limit described above, light scattering becomes impossible to ignore, and it may not be possible to achieve the objective of improving the refractive index or the transparency.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0061">Here, the âcumulant average particle sizeâ is the average particle size of the microparticles calculated from the signal strength when measured with a dynamic light scattering particle size distribution meter using a cumulant method as a correlation calculation method and can be calculated, for example, by a conventional method from the measurement of the particle size distribution according to the dynamic light scattering method. Unless specified otherwise, âparticle sizeâ or âaverage particle sizeâ will hereafter refer to the âcumulant average particle size.â In the experimental examples of the inventions of this application, the cumulant average particle size is measured using a Zeta-potential and Particle Size Analyzer ELSZ-2 (manufactured by Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd.).</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0062">The metal oxide of component (B) has a refractive index of at least 1.55, preferably at least 1.70, and particularly preferably 1.90 for light of a wavelength of 633 nm at 25Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0063">Examples of such a metal oxide include barium titanate, zirconium oxide, aluminum oxide (alumina), titanium oxide, strontium titanate, barium zirconate titanate, cerium oxide, cobalt oxide, indium tin oxide, hafnium oxide, yttrium oxide, tin oxide, niobium oxide, and iron oxide. In particular, a metal oxide containing at least one type of metal element selected from titanium, zirconium, and barium is preferable from the perspective of optical properties yielding a refractive index of at least 2.0 and electrical properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0064">In particular, zirconium oxide has a relatively high refractive index (refractive index: 1.9 to 2.4) and is therefore useful for optical material applications which require a high refractive index and high transparency. Similarly, barium titanate has a high dielectric constant and a high refractive index (refractive index: 2.4) and is useful for imparting performance to the silicone cured product optically and electromagnetically.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0065">By containing components (A) and (B) described above, the curable silicone composition of the present invention can form a silicone cured product with a high refractive index of at least 1.55 after curing. Further, it is possible to provide a cured product with excellent heat resistance and low water vapor permeability by using component (A). In addition, in accordance with the selection of component (B) and other fillers, the curable silicone composition of the present invention can provide a heat conductive or an electrically conductive cured product.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0066">Further, the curable silicone composition of the present invention preferably contains a surface treatment agentâin particular, a surface treatment agent comprising an organic silicon compound. Surface-treating metal oxide microparticles such as barium titanate makes it possible to finely and stably disperse the metal oxide microparticles in a hydrophobic silicone resin and enables more stable large-scale compounding in comparison to untreated microparticles. As a result, there is the advantage that the optical properties (in particular, high refringence) and electromagnetic properties of the resulting cured product can be dramatically improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0067">&lt;Component (C)&gt;</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0068">In particular, the curable silicone composition of the present invention preferably contains an organic silicon compound having a specific functional group bonded to silicon atoms in the molecule and having at least one structure in the molecule in which other siloxane units are bonded to the silicon atoms. This organic silicon compound has a site which interacts with the surface of the optical material directly or after hydrolysis and a site which provides characteristics originating from a silicon-based polymer in the same molecule and can therefore dramatically improve the dispersibility of the metal oxide microparticles in the curable silicone composition. Further, the organic silicon compound of the present invention preferably has a refractive index of at least 1.45, which is higher than that of an organic silicon compound primarily consisting of methyl siloxane units, which yields the advantage that the refractive index of the resulting silicone cured product will not be diminished and the transparency will not be lost. In addition, the organic silicon compound of the present invention preferably further contains a functional group which is hydrosilylation-reactive with the silicone composition, which yields the advantage that the surface-treated metal oxide microparticles or the like are stably dispersed in the curable resin and can be compounded in large quantities. Further, since a structure consisting of siloxane bonds (SiâOâSi), silalkylene bonds, or the like has excellent thermal stability, problems such as the yellowing or discoloration of metal oxide microparticles treated using the organic silicon compound or an optical device containing the metal oxide microparticles are unlikely to arise, which yields the advantage that the heat resistance is improved.</p>

By interacting with the surface of the metal oxide microparticles, this functional group can align, modify, or form bonds with the organic silicon compound of the present invention on the surface of the metal oxide microparticles and thereby modify the characteristics of the surface. This interaction with the surface is an interaction or bond reaction with the material surface caused by the polarity of the functional group, the formation of hydrogen bonds caused by terminal hydroxyl groups, or a bond reaction with the material surface caused by a hydrolyzable functional group, and these interactions may be applied during or after the formation of the target metal oxide microparticles. In particular, at the time of the treatment of metal oxide microparticles with high surface hydrophilicity in the untreated state, the interaction between the material surface and these functional groups is strong, which has the advantage that an excellent surface-modifying effect can be realized even when a small amount is used.</p>

Further, an organic silicon compound with a high refractive index of at least 1.60 can be designed by increasing the ratio of the groups selected from phenyl groups, condensed polycyclic aromatic groups, and groups containing condensed polycyclic aromatic groups that constitute all of the silicon atom-bonded functional groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0089">The method for designing the refractive index of the organic silicon compound of the present invention so as to fall within the range described above may use a metal-containing organic silicon compound having bonds between metal atoms and silicon atoms in the molecule to provide a high refractive index, but it is industrially preferable to introduce aromatic ring-containing organic groups which provide a high refractive index as silicon-bonded functional groups. In particular, it is preferable for at least 30 mol % of all of the silicon-bonded functional groups in the organic silicon compound of the present invention to be groups selected from phenyl groups, condensed polycyclic aromatic groups, and groups containing condensed polycyclic aromatic groups, and this makes it possible to easily design an organic silicon compound with a refractive index of at least 1.45. Excluding the silicon atoms in the functional groups (Q), it is more preferable for at least 40 mol % of the monovalent functional groups bonded to all of the silicon atoms in the molecule to be groups selected from phenyl groups, condensed polycyclic aromatic groups, and groups containing condensed polycyclic aromatic groups, and it is particularly preferable for from 40 to 80 mol % to be phenyl groups or naphthyl groups. The refractive index of the organic silicon compound increases as the ratio of these functional groups that are introduced increases, and an organic silicon compound into which the same number of naphthyl groups has been introduced tends to exhibit a higher refractive index than an organic silicon compound into which the same number of phenyl groups has been introduced.</p>

However, when the functional groups (Q) are silicon atom-containing hydrolyzable groups, it is preferable to have from 2 to 1000 silicon atoms in the molecule, excluding the silicon atoms in the functional groups (Q).

Further, component (C) of the present invention may use an organic silicon compound with a relatively large number of silicon atoms and an organic silicon compound with a relatively small number of silicon atoms in accordance with the type, size, and treatment method of component (B) used for treatment.</p>

Further, it is preferable for the number of silicon atoms having the functional groups (Q) bonded directly or via functional groups with a valency of (n+1) (n is a number equal to 1 or greater) in the organic silicon compound of the present invention (excluding the silicon atoms in the functional groups (Q)) to be a number no greater than â the number of all of the silicon atoms in the molecule (excluding the silicon atoms in the functional groups (Q)). From the perspective of modifying the surface of the optical material, the number is preferably at most â, more preferably at most 1/10, and particularly preferably at most 1/20 the number of all of the silicon atoms in the molecule.

The other monovalent hydrocarbon groups are preferably selected from methyl groups, vinyl groups, and hexenyl groups.

      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0093">The organic silicon compound aligns, modifies, or bonds to the surface of the surface-treated metal oxide microparticles, but by having reactive sites in the composition cured by a hydrosilylation reaction at this time, the compound is efficiently incorporated into the curing system for each treatment substrate, which yields the advantage that the dispersion stability and compounding stability are improved.

      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0176">With the compositions illustrated in Table 2, the titanium oxide dispersion 2 described above in an amount so that the titanium oxide content was a prescribed amount, a vinyl functional polyorganosiloxane, and an SiH functional polyorganosiloxane were mixed. Next, a platinum complex of 1,3-divinyltetramethyldisiloxane was mixed in an amount so that the platinum metal was 2 ppm in weight units with respect to the solid content so as to prepare a solution of a curable organopolysiloxane composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0177">This solution of the curable organopolysiloxane was dripped onto a glass plate and dried for one hour at 70Â° C. After the solvent was removed, the mixture was heated for 2 hours at 150Â° C. to obtain a cured product.</p>
      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0178">The makeup of the cured organopolysiloxane compositions and the evaluation results of the cured products are shown in Table 1. The SiH/Vi ratio in the table represents the number of moles of silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in the SiH functional polyorganosiloxane with respect to a total of 1 mole of the dispersion and vinyl groups in the vinyl functional polyorganosiloxane in the curable organopolysiloxane composition.</p>
