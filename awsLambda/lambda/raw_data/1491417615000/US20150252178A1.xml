      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This non-provisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. Â§119 (a) on Patent Application No. 2014-043365 filed in Japan on Mar. 5, 2014, which is entirely herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a cellulose acylate film, a polarizing plate protective film, a polarizing plate and a liquid crystal display using the same.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Cellulose acylate films are used for various liquid crystal displays, as optical elements thereof, such as supports for optical compensation films, and protective films for polarizing plates.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In addition to an indoor use of the liquid crystal display, such as a TV use, a chance of the outdoor use thereof is increased, for example, use as a mobile device. As a result, development of a liquid crystal display is required, which is impervious to the use under the conditions of higher temperature and higher humidity than ever before. However, when the liquid crystal display is used under the conditions of higher temperature and higher humidity, there is a problem of deterioration of display performance due to occurrence of unevenness or lowering in polarization performance, each of which is caused by contraction of the polarizer. Further, in the liquid crystal display, a demand for durability in a wide array of uses and under extreme use condition has been increasing, and year after year a higher level of durability than before has been required. Further, more improvement in these performances has been required as a result of making a liquid crystal display thinner in recent years.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Patent Literature 1 describes that durability of the polarizer under the conditions of higher temperature and higher humidity can be improved, by a resin film (including a cellulose acylate film) containing an organic acid with acid dissociation constant of from 2 to 7 in a particular solvent. Further, Patent Literature 2 proposes to suppress retardation developing property and internal haze, by a chelating agent whose chelate constant (chelate stability constant) with Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions is 2 or more.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0008">The present invention is contemplated for providing: a cellulose acylate films in which generation of both foreign substances and bright spots has been suppressed by deactivating a tiny amount of metal ions, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, which are mixed in a dope, in the production of the cellulose acylate film, and variation of film thickness due to heat and humidity aging is less, and durability is excellent; protective films for polarizing plates; and polarizing plates and liquid crystal displays using the same, respectively.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0009">Research by the present inventors revealed that an aliphatic or aromatic monocarboxylic acid has a low inhibitory effect on formation of foreign substance caused by agglomeration of cellulose, due to polyvalent metal ion incorporation, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Further, the research revealed that a chelating agent having a plurality of carboxymethylamino groups, such as imimodiacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, ethylenediaminedipropionic acid, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and the like, has a high chelate constant with Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, whereas it has a low solubility in an organic solvent, such as methylene chloride, methanol, and the like, which is used in production of cellulose acylate films. As a result of a study, the present inventors found that in the case where these chelating agents are contained in the cellulose acylate film, even though the agglomeration of cellulose is suppressed, the chelating agent itself deposits to cause a foreign substance, and also such a chelating agent having a high chelate constant with Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions has a large variation of the film thickness with heat and humidity aging.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0010">On the one hand, as a result of the study, the present inventors found that the chelating agent having a high solubility in an organic solvent, such as methylene chloride, methanol, and the like, has a low effect on deactivation of the polyvalent metal ion.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0011">As a result of various studies based on the above findings, the present inventors have found that there is a possibility that the above problem can be resolved, by using chelating agents each having a different pKa value from one another in combination. The present invention has been attained by further studies.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0012">According to the present invention, there is provided the following means:</p>

      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Hereinafter, the present invention is described in detail referring to the embodiments.</p>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="2">&lt;&lt;Cellulose Acylate Film&gt;&gt;</heading>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The cellulose acylate film of the present invention contains at least two or more of chelating agents having different pKa values from one another, and the number of bright spots of the cellulose acylate film is equal to or less than 500 per 1 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The cellulose acylate film of the present invention is suitable for use as a protective film for a polarizing plate.</p>
      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="2">&lt;The Number of Bright Spots&gt;</heading>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">As shown in Examples given below, the number of bright spots of the cellulose acylate film is calculated by arranging two sheets of polarizing plates in a cross-nicol alignment, inserting a cellulose acylate film between them, and then observing it under a polarizing microscope (objective lensÃ50 times), to measure the number of bright spots per 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. The number of bright spots is preferably equal to or less than 500 per 1 cm<sup>2</sup>, more preferably equal to or less than 450 per 1 cm<sup>2</sup>, and still more preferably equal to or less than 300 per 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. The lower limit is not limited in particular, but 10 or more per 1 cm<sup>2 </sup>in practice.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Occurrence of bright spots can be deduced, by containing a chelating agent having a large chelate constant into a cellulose acylate film, to deactivate metal ions and thereby suppressing agglomeration of cellulose acylate. Further, generation of foreign substance is decreased, because solubility of the chelating agent in a solvent for film formation is improved, by using chelating agents having different pKa values from one another in combination to form an organic salt. As a result, the number of bright spots can be controlled to the above range.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="2">&lt;Chelating Agent Having a Functional Group Whose Acid Dissociation Constant pKa of 6 or Less&gt;</heading>

Although details of this mechanism are not clear, the present inventors suppose that agglomeration of cellulose acylate and deposition of the chelating agent can be suppressed by the present invention, and as a result, it is possible to suppress a phenomenon that as a result of long-term exposure under conditions of high temperature and high humidity, moisture gets through the inner part of the polymer chain of cellulose acylate agglomerated by metal ion and resultantly the agglomerated portion is swollen, or a phenomenon that a chelating agent is deposited on a surface of the cellulose acylate film and resultantly a surface state is deteriorated.</p>

      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In the present invention, cellulose acylate is used as a main component of the cellulose acylate film. One cellulose acylate may be used, or alternatively two or more thereof may be used in combination. The cellulose acylate may be a cellulose acylate having, for example, only an acetyl group as the acyl substituent thereof. Alternatively, a cellulose acylate having a plurality of different acyl substituents as the acyl substituent thereof may be used. The cellulose acylate may be a mixture of cellulose acylates that are different from one another.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The cellulose material for cellulose acylate which is used in the present invention includes cotton liter and wood pulp (hardwood pulp, softwood pulp), and cellulose acylate obtained from any of such a cellulose material are usable herein. Those cellulose materials may be mixed for use herein. The cellulose materials are described in detail, for example, in Marusawa &amp; Uda's âPlastic Material Lecture (17), Cellulose Resinâ by Nikkan Kogyo Shinbun (1970) and Hatsumei Kyokai's Disclosure Bulletin 2001-1745 (pp. 7-8), and those celluloses described therein may be usable herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In the present specification, the acyl group of the cellulose acylate may be one acyl group, or two or more acyl groups. It is preferable that the cellulose acylate to be used in the present invention has an acyl group having 2 or greater carbon atoms as a substituent. The acyl group having 2 or greater carbon atoms is not particularly limited, such that it may be an aliphatic acyl group or an aromatic acyl group. Examples thereof include cellulosic alkylcarbonyl ester groups, alkenylcarbonyl ester groups, aromatic carbonyl ester groups, and aromatic alkylcarbonyl ester groups, each of which may have a substituted group. Preferable examples thereof include acetyl, propionyl, butanoyl, heptanoyl, hexanoyl, octanoyl, decanoyl, dodecanoyl, tridecanoyl, tetradecanoyl, hexadecanoyl, octadecanoyl, isobutanoyl, tert-butanoyl, cyclohexane carbonyl, oleoyl, benzoyl, naphthylcarbonyl, and cinnamoyl. Among these, more preferred are acetyl, propionyl, butanoyl, decanoyl, octadecanoyl, tert-butanoyl, oleoyl, benzoyl, naphthyl carbonyl, cinnamoyl, and the like. Further preferred are acetyl, propionyl and butanoyl.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">It is preferable that the cellulose acylate to be used in the present invention has an acyl group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms as a substituent. When two or more acyl groups are used, it is preferable that one kind of the acyl groups is an acetyl group and another kind of the acyl group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms is preferably propionyl group or butyryl group. By use of these cellulose acylates, a solution with a good solubility can be prepared. Especially in a non-chlorine organic solvent, preparation of a good solution becomes possible with these cellulose acylates. Further, preparation of a solution having a low viscosity and a good filterability becomes possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">In the present invention, it is especially preferable that the cellulose acylate has an acetyl group only as an acyl group, from the viewpoint of effectively exhibiting effects owing to the chelating agents A and B according to the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Hereinafter, cellulose acylate to be preferably used in the present invention is described in detail.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The glucose unit having Î²-1,4 bonds which constitutes cellulose has free hydroxy groups at the 2-, 3-, and 6-positions thereof. The cellulose acylate is a polymeric substance (polymer) in which a part of or all of these hydroxy groups is or are acylated.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The acyl substitution degree indicates a degree of acylation of the hydroxy groups located at the 2-, 3-, and 6-positions of cellulose. When each of the hydroxy groups at the 2-, 3-, and 6-positions of all of the glucose units is acylated, the total acyl substitution degree is 3. For example, when each of the hydroxy groups only at the 6-position of all of the glucose units is acylated, the total acyl substitution degree is 1. In the same manner, even if each of the hydroxy groups at either the 6-position or the 2-position of the entire glucose unit is acylated, the total acyl substitution degree is 1.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">That is to say, the acyl substitution degree indicates a degree of acylation, provided that when all of the hydroxy groups of the glucose molecule are entirely acylated, the acyl substitution degree is 3.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">The details of the measurement method of the acyl substitution degree are described in Tezuka et al. (Carbohydrate, Res., 273 (1995) p. 83 to 91). The acyl substitution degree can be determined according to the method defined in ASTM-D817-96.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">When the total acyl substitution degree of the cellulose acylate to be used in the present invention is A, A is preferably from 1.5 to 3.0 (1.5&lt;A&lt;3.0), more preferably from 2.00 to 2.97, still further preferably from 2.50 to less than 2.97, and particularly preferably from 2.70 to 2.95.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">When the acyl group of the cellulose acylate to be used in the present invention is only an acetyl group, if we take the total acetyl substitution degree is B, B is preferably from 2.0 to 3.0 (2.0&lt;B&lt;3.0), more preferably from 2.0 to 2.97, still more preferably from 2.5 to less than 2.97, especially preferably from 2.55 to less than 2.97, more specially preferably from 2.60 to 2.96, and particularly preferably from 2.70 to 2.95.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">In the present specification, the effects of the chelating agents A and B are exerted particularly with respect to the cellulose acylate in which A that is the total degree of acyl substitution is more than 2.00.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">In the case where the cellulose acylate film of the optical film of the present invention is a laminate (multilayer configuration), the degree of acyl group substitution of the cellulose acylate in each layer may be uniform or a plurality of cellulose acrylates which have different degrees of acyl group substitution or different acyl groups may be present in one layer in a mixed manner in the cellulose acylate film.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">In the case where an acid anhydride or an acid chloride is used as an acylating agent in acylation of the cellulose, methylene chloride or an organic acid, for example, acetic acid and the like, is used as an organic solvent which acts as a reaction solvent.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">As for the catalyst, when the acylating agent is an acid anhydride, a protic catalyst, such as sulfuric acid, is preferably used. While, when the acylating agent is an acid chloride (for example, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COCl), a basic compound is used as the catalyst.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">A most common industrial method for the synthesis of a mixed fatty acid ester of cellulose is a method of acylating cellulose with a mixed organic acid component that includes fatty acids corresponding to an acetyl group and to any other acyl group (e.g. acetic acid, propionic acid, valeric acid) or their acid anhydrides.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The cellulose acylate may be produced, for example, according to the method described in JP-A-10-45804.</p>

      <heading id="h-00024-en" level="2">(Elastic Modulus (Tensile Elastic Modulus))</heading>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0105">The cellulose acylate film of the present invention exhibits practically-sufficient elastic modulus (tensile elastic modulus). The range of the elastic modulus, although it is not particularly limited, is preferably from 1.0 GPa to 7.0 GPa, and more preferably from 2.0 GPa to 6.5 GPa, from the viewpoint of production suitability and handling property. The chelating agents A and B of the present invention act such that the cellulose acylate film is hydrophobized by addition of the agents to a cellulose acylate, thereby improving elastic modulus. In this point, the present invention also has an advantage.</p>
      <heading id="h-00025-en" level="2">(Photoelastic Coefficient)</heading>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0106">The absolute value of photoelastic coefficient of the cellulose acylate film of the present invention is preferably 8.0Ã10<sup>â12 </sup>m<sup>2</sup>/N or less, more preferably 6.0Ã10<sup>â12 </sup>m<sup>2</sup>/N or less, and still more preferably 5.0Ã10<sup>â12 </sup>m<sup>2</sup>/N or less. Lessening the photoelastic coefficient of the cellulose acylate film enables suppression of occurrence of unevenness under the conditions of high temperature and high humidity upon mounting of the optical film of the present invention including the cellulose acylate film into a liquid crystal display as a polarizing plate protective film. The photoelastic coefficient is measured and calculated in accordance with the following method, unless specified otherwise.</p>

      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0109">The moisture content of the cellulose acylate film can be evaluated by measurement of equilibrium moisture content under the constant temperature and humidity. The equilibrium moisture content is obtained by the following method. That is, the moisture content of a sample which has reached equilibrium after leaving it for 24 hours at the above temperature and humidity is measured in accordance with Karl Fischer method, and the obtained moisture content (g) is divided by the sample mass (g) to obtain the equilibrium moisture content.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0110">The moisture content of the cellulose acylate film of the present invention under the conditions of 25Â° C. and relative humidity of 80% is preferably 5% by mass or less, more preferably 4% by mass or less, and still more preferably less than 3% by mass. Lessening the moisture content of the cellulose acylate film enables suppression of occurrence of display unevenness of a liquid crystal display, under the conditions of high temperature and high humidity upon mounting of the optical film of the present invention including the cellulose acylate film into the liquid crystal display as a polarizing plate protective film. The lower limit of the moisture content is not particularly limited. However, it is practical to be 0.1% by mass or greater.</p>

When the haze is lowered to the above-described upper limit or less, the cellulose acylate film has advantages in that transparency of the film is more increased and thus the film becomes more usable as an optical film. The haze is measured and calculated in accordance with the method used in Examples described below, unless specified otherwise. The lower limit of the haze is not particularly limited, but it is practical to be 0.001% or greater.</p>

Setting the average film thickness to 10 Î¼m or greater is preferable, because handling property during production of a web film is improved. While, on the other hand, when the average film thickness is set to 100 Î¼m or less, the response to humidity change becomes easy and thus maintenance of the optical characteristics becomes easy.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0116">Further, in the case where the cellulose acylate film has a multi-layered structure of three or more multi-layers, the film thickness of the core layer is preferably from 3 to 70 Î¼m, and more preferably from 5 to 60 Î¼m, and each of the film thicknesses of the skin layer A and skin layer B is more preferably from 0.5 to 20 Î¼m, particularly preferably from 0.5 to 10 Î¼m, and most preferably from 0.5 to 3 Î¼m.</p>

      <heading id="h-00032-en" level="2">(Casting Methods)</heading>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0119">As the method of casting a solution, examples of the solution casting method (i.e. solvent-casting method) include: a method for uniformly extruding a prepared dope from a pressure die onto a metal support; a doctor blade method for adjusting, with a blade, the film thickness of a dope once cast onto a metal support; and a reverse roll coater method for adjusting it with a reverse rotating roll, but the method of using a pressure die is preferred. Examples of the pressure die include a coat hanger-type or a T die-type, and any of them may be preferably used. In addition to these methods exemplified herein, various methods of film production by casting a cellulose acylate solution, which are known in the art, may be employed. When each of conditions is set in consideration of the difference in the boiling points of solvents to be used, the same effects as the contents described in each publication can be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0120">Co-Casting</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0121">In formation of the cellulose acylate film, a multi-layer casting method, such as a co-casting method, a sequential casting method, and a coating method, is preferable. Especially, a simultaneous co-casting method is particularly preferred, from the viewpoints of stable production and production cost.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0122">In the case where the film is produced according to a co-casting method and a sequential casting method, first a cellulose acetate solution (dope) for each layer is prepared. The co-casting method (multilayer simultaneous casting method) is a casting method in which individual layers are simultaneously cast by simultaneously extruding co-casting dopes onto a casting support (band or dram) from a casting Giesser through which the individual casting dopes for intended layers (the number of the layers may be three or more) are simultaneously extruded via different slits, and then at a suitable time, the film formed on the support is peeled away and dried. In <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the cross-sectional view shows a state in which casting is performed by simultaneously extruding three layers formed of a dope 1 for two surface layers and a dope 2 for core layer on a casting support 4, using a co-casting Giesser 3.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0123">The sequential casting method is a casting method in which first a casting dope for first layer is extruded out and cast onto a casting support through a casting Giesser, then after it is dried or not dried, a casting dope for second layer is extruded through the casting Giesser and cast onto the first layer, and if needed, three or more layers are sequentially formed by casting and laminating dopes in the same manner as the above, and then at a suitable time, the resultant laminate is peeled away from the support and dried to form a cellulose acylate film. The coating method is generally a method in which a core layer is formed of film by means of film formation with solution, then a coating solution for a surface layer is prepared, and then using a suitable coater, the coating solution is applied onto the core layer first on one surface thereof and next on the other surface thereof, or simultaneously on both surfaces thereof, and dried to form a multi-layered cellulose acylate film.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0124">As the endlessly running metal support for use in production of the cellulose acylate film, it is possible to use a dram the surface of which is mirror-finished by chromium plating, or a stainless belt (may be called as a band) the surface of which is mirror-finished by surface polish. One or at least two pressure dies may be used by arranging it or them above the metal support. Preferably, one or two pressure dies are arranged. In the case where two or more pressure dies are arranged, a casting amount of the dope may be divided into portions which are suitable for the individual dies; or the casting dope may be fed to the die at a suitable proportion from a plurality of precision metering gear pumps. The temperature of the dope (resin solution) to be used for casting is preferably from â10Â° C. to 55Â° C., and more preferably from 25Â° C. to 50Â° C. In this case, the solution temperature may be the same throughout the entire process, or may be different in different stages of the process. In the case where the temperatures are different in different stages, it is no problem as long as the dope has a desired temperature just before casting.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0125">Further, the material of the above metal support, although it is not particularly limited, is preferably made of SUS (for example, SUS 316).</p>
      <heading id="h-00033-en" level="2">(Peeling)</heading>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0126">The method of producing the cellulose acylate film preferably includes a process of peeling off the above dope film from the metal support. In the production method of the cellulose acylate film, the method of peeling off is not particularly limited, and peeling property can be improved by any of methods known for peeling-off.</p>
      <heading id="h-00034-en" level="2">(Stretching Process)</heading>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0127">The method of producing the cellulose acylate film preferably includes a stretching process after film production. The stretching direction of the cellulose acylate film is preferable in any of a cellulose acylate film conveying direction (MD direction) and an orthogonal direction (TD direction) to the conveying direction. However, the orthogonal direction (TD direction) to cellulose acylate film conveying direction is particularly preferred from the viewpoint of the subsequent polarizing plate-manufacturing process using the cellulose acylate film.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0128">A method of stretching the film in the TD direction is described, for example, in JP-A-62-115035, JP-A-4-152125, JP-A-4-284211, JP-A-4-298310, JP-A-11-48271, and the like. In the case of stretching in the MD direction, the cellulose acylate film is stretched when the cellulose acylate film winding speed is set to be faster than the cellulose acylate film peeling-off speed, for example, by adjusting a speed of the cellulose acylate film-conveying roller. In the case of stretching in the TD direction, the cellulose acylate film may be stretched by conveying the cellulose acylate film while holding the width of the cellulose acylate film with a tenter, and extending the width of the tenter gradually. After drying the cellulose acylate film, the film may be also stretched by using a stretching machine (preferably uniaxial stretching by using a long stretching machine).</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0129">In the case where the cellulose acylate film is used as a protective film for a polarizer, the transmission axis of the polarizer and the in-plane slow axis of the cellulose acylate film are required to be arranged parallel to one another, in order to suppress the light leakage when viewed from oblique directions to the polarizing plate. The transmission axis of the roll film-shaped polarizer that is produced continuously is generally parallel to the width direction of the roll film, and thus, in order to continuously sticking the above roll film-shaped polarizing element together with a protective film composed of the roll film-shaped cellulose acylate film, the in-plane slow axis of the roll film-shaped protective film is required to be parallel to the width direction of the cellulose acylate film. Accordingly, the film is preferably stretched to a larger extent in the TD direction. The stretching treatment may be conducted in the course of the film production process, or the original film obtained by rewinding the produced film may be subjected to a stretching treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0130">The stretching in the TD direction is preferably from 5 to 100%, more preferably from 5 to 80%, and particularly preferably from 5 to 40%. Meanwhile, non-stretching means that stretching is 0%. The stretching treatment may be conducted in the course of the film production process, or the original film obtained by rewinding the produced film may be subjected to a stretching treatment. In the former case, stretching may be conducted in the condition where a certain amount of a residual solvent is contained, and when the residual solvent amount, i.e. (mass of residual volatile substance/mass of film after heat treatment)Ã100(%), is from 0.05 to 50%, the stretching is preferably conducted. It is particularly preferable to conduct the stretching of from 5 to 80% in the condition where the residual solvent amount is from 0.05 to 5%.</p>
      <heading id="h-00035-en" level="2">(Drying)</heading>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0131">It is preferable, from the viewpoint of enhancing the retardation, that the method of producing the cellulose acylate film includes a step of drying the cellulose acylate film and a step of stretching the thus-dried cellulose acylate film at a temperature which is equal to or higher than the glass transition temperature (Tg)â10Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0132">Drying of the dope provided on the metal support that is included in the production of the cellulose acylate film, generally includes: a method of blowing a hot air from a surface side of the metal support (dram or belt), that is to say, from the surface of a web provided on the metal support; a method of blowing a hot air from a back side of the dram or belt; a back-side liquid heat transfer method in which a temperature-modulated liquid is brought into contact with the back side opposite to the casting side of the dram or belt, thereby heating the dram or belt through heat transfer to control a surface temperature; and the like. Among these, the back-side liquid heat transfer method is preferred. The surface temperature of the metal support before casting is conducted is not particularly limited as long as it is not higher than the boiling point of a solvent which is used for a dope. However, in order to accelerate drying or to make the dope lose fluidity on the metal support, the surface temperature is preferably set to a temperature which is lower by 1 to 10Â° C. than the boiling point of the solvent having the lowest boiling point among the solvents to be used for the dope. However, this shall not apply in the case where the casting dope is cooled and then peeled off without drying.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0133">The adjustment of the cellulose acylate film thickness may be achieved by adjusting a concentration of the solid contained in the dope, a slit space of the die nozzle, an extrusion pressure from a die, a speed of the metal support, or the like, so as to be a desired thickness.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0134">The thus-obtained cellulose acylate film is preferably wound at the degree of from 100 to 10,000 m, more preferably from 500 to 7,000 m, and still more preferably from 1,000 to 6,000 m, in length per roll. At the time of winding, at least one end thereof is preferably subjected to knurling. The width of knurling is preferably from 3 mm to 50 mm and more preferably from 5 mm to 30 mm. The height thereof is preferably from 0.5 Î¼m to 500 Î¼m and more preferably from 1 Î¼m to 200 Î¼m. This may be either one-way press or two-way press.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0135">Since reduction in contrast and tingeing in an oblique direction generally become remarkable in the large screen displays, the above-described cellulose acylate film is especially suitable for use in such a large screen liquid crystal display. When the film is used as an optical compensation film for a large screen liquid crystal display, molding the film so as to be, for example, 1,470 mm or more in width is preferred. Further, the aspect of the polarizing plate protective film of the present invention includes a film piece that is cut to a size capable of being mounted as it is in a liquid crystal display, as well as a film that is manufactured in a long shape by continuous production and wound in a roll shape. The polarizing plate protective film of the latter aspect is stored or conveyed as it is, and is used by cutting to a desired size when the film is mounted in a liquid crystal display, or when the film and a polarizer or the like are stuck together in practice. Alternatively, the polarizing plate protective film is used by cutting to a desired size when the film is mounted in a liquid crystal display in practice after sticking the film in a long shape as it is with a polarizer composed of a polyvinyl alcohol film or the like manufactured similarly in a long shape. As an aspect of the optical compensation film which is wound in a roll shape, an aspect of a film which is wound in a roll shape and has a roll length of 2,500 m or more, is exemplified.</p>
      <heading id="h-00036-en" level="2">&lt;&lt;Functional Layer&gt;&gt;</heading>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0136">In the cellulose acylate film of the present invention, functional layers for different purposes may be optionally disposed on the cellulose acylate film.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0137">Examples of the functional layer include a hard coat layer, an antireflection layer, a light scattering layer, an antifouling layer, an antistatic layer, and the like. These layers providing a plurality of functions may be combined by one layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0138">As an example, the hard coat layer is a layer for imparting hardness or scratch resistance to the optical film of the present invention. It is possible to form a hard coat layer exhibiting high adhesive property with respect to the cellulose acylate film in cooperation with the two kinds of chelating agents in the present invention, for example, by applying a coating composition on the cellulose acylate film and curing it. Filler and additive may be added to the hard coat layer, to thereby make the hard coat layer itself have additional mechanical, electrical or optical physical properties or chemical properties, such as water repellency or oil repellency. The thickness of the hard coat layer is preferably 0.1 to 6 Î¼m, more preferably from 3 to 6 Î¼m. Having such a thin hard coat layer of which the thickness falls within the range, the optical film can have improved physical properties in point of brittleness reduction and curling prevention and can attain other advantages of weight saving and production cost cutting.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0139">Preferably, the hard coat layer is formed by curing a curable composition. Preferably, the curable composition is prepared as a liquid coating composition. One example of the coating composition contains a monomer or an oligomer for matrix formation binder, other polymer, and organic solvent. Curing the coating composition applied to the substrate film forms the intended hard coat layer. The curing reaction includes crosslinking or polymerization.</p>

Adding a polymer compound to the layer is preferred, as capable of reducing the curing shrinkage of the layer and capable of facilitating the viscosity control of the coating liquid that takes an interest in the dispersion stability (coagulability) of resin particles.

A band casting device was used to cast the thus-prepared dope on a casting support made of stainless steel (support temperature 22Â° C.). The film was peeled off in a state where the amount of the remaining solvent in the dope was 10% by mass to 40% by mass, followed by drying while being stretched by 1.15 times (15%) at a temperature of 120Â° C. in the width direction, in a state where the amount of the remaining solvent was 5% by mass to 30% by mass while gripping both ends of the film in the width direction with a tenter. After that, the film was further dried by letting it transport between rolls of the heat treatment apparatus, to prepare the cellulose acylate film No. 101 of the present invention. The thickness of the thus-obtained cellulose acylate film was 40 Î¼m.</p>

      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0186">The number of bright spots per cm<sup>2 </sup>was measured, by arranging two sheets of polarizing plates in a cross-nicol alignment, inserting the thus-prepared cellulose acylate film between them, and observing the thus-sandwiched product under a polarizing microscope (objective lensÃ50 times).</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0187">The polarizing plate was produced in the following manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0188">A polarizing film was prepared, by adsorbing iodine onto a stretched polyvinyl alcohol. A commercially available cellulose acetate film (FUJITAC TD80UF, manufactured by FUJIFILM Corporation, (Re=0, Rth=40 nm)) was subjected to a saponification treatment. Then, the saponified cellulose acetate film was stacked with a polyvinyl alcohol-based adhesive on both sides of the above-prepared polarizer, to prepare a polarizing plate.</p>

      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0190">Then, the above cellulose acylate film was put into a 500 ml-volumetric SUS316 container, and subjected to humidity conditioning at temperature of 85Â° C. and relative humidity of 97% for 2 hours, and then a lid of the container was closed. Further, the cellulose acylate film was stored at 85Â° C. and relative humidity of 97% for 350 hours. Then, the cellulose acylate film was taken out from the container, and after humidity conditioning under the environment of temperature 25Â° C. and relative humidity 60% for 2 hours, a film thickness was measured, to calculate the rate of change in the film thickness, in accordance with the following formula.</p>
