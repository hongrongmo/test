      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">This invention relates to equipment for delivering liquid products, such as fertilizers or pesticides, to and discharging the liquid products at individual rows of an agricultural implement such as a planter.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Planters and other row type agricultural implements are commonly outfitted with liquid dispensing systems for distributing liquid agricultural chemicals, such as liquid fertilizer, to each row unit and dispensing the liquid in close proximity to the row unit. Such liquid dispensing systems typically include a tank for holding the liquid, a pump for pumping liquid from the tank, a plurality of branched distribution lines through which the liquid is distributed to a plurality of nozzles or delivery tubes. The liquid is dispersed out of the nozzle or delivery tube onto the field.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Precision agriculture techniques sometimes require widely varying amounts of a chemical to be applied in different sections of the same field. For example, the farmer may want to apply 5 gallons per acre (GPA) in one area and apply 35 GPA in another area of the same field. The farmer may also operate at a minimum speed of 4 miles per hour (MPH) in one section, but increase to a maximum speed of 10 MPH in another. This combination of changes in application rate and speed at which the implement traverses the field requires a very large change in liquid flow.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The ability to measure variations in the amount of liquid delivered is easily accomplished with existing flow meters. Likewise, pumps can be controlled to deliver the total volume of liquid necessary over a very wide range of total product flow.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">However, existing systems are not adequate to divide the total flow for an implement (for example a 24 row, 60 foot wide corn planter) down to 24 equal flows to apply to each row or application point the farmer desires. A basic system currently in use to control flow is an orifice disc with an equal size orifice for each application point. The orifice creates back pressure in the liquid distribution tubes then the pressure created produces equal flow through each equal sized orifice. However, fluid dynamics works such that a four-fold increase in pressure is required to gain a two-fold increase in flow. Given that the maximum total pressure is practically limited to under 100 psi with the components typically used in these systems, the maximum flow difference that can be generated by pressure changes is limited. The typical response has been to limit the range of liquid applied to what one orifice can accomplish. Then the farmer can change each orifice disc to a different size if they needed to change their application rate. This process is messy, time consuming and not practical within a single field.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">There have been improvements on the standard orifice disc. One is to use a spring controlled variable orifice. An example of this type of device is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7,124,964 to Quy Duc Bui. These devices advertise a wider flow range for a given pressure difference than a standard orifice disc. However, in the field they do not always produce sufficiently equal flows at each row to satisfy the farmer's needs.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Another product used to achieve this goal is the fluid flow divider sold by John Blue Company and described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,311,716 of Kent R. Jones assigned to John Blue Company. However, these devices are believed to lose row-to-row accuracy at lower application rates.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">It is also known to use a metering tube to improve upon the traditional orifice disc. This is a tube with a specific inside diameter, that is of a substantial length (four to twelve feet is typical). This provides the same pressure drop function as an orifice to create equal row-to-row distribution. However, due to flow dynamics in a tube versus an orifice, an equal pressure range will produce a greater flow range in the tube versus the orifice disc. This allows the farmer to achieve greater variability in liquid application rates and implement speeds with the metering tube compared to the traditional orifice disc.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">It is also known to use dual metering tube systems comprising two metering tubes of different internal diameter for each row. A manually operated valve is used in such systems to selectively direct the flow through only the first tube or only the second tube or through both the first and second tubes allowing the operator to achieve wider flow rates through the tubing at each row unit. However, the manual setting of the system requires the operator to correctly assess which selection of tubes is appropriate and may require the operator to manually readjust the valves when the desired application rates change.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The present invention comprises an improvement to dual metering tube systems for use in directing liquid to the row units of an agricultural implement which uses metering tubes of different diameters, a pressure sensor to sense the pressure in a trunk line through which liquid is fed to the metering tubes and a controller for operating one or more valves to selectively direct liquid through only a set of small diameter tubes, only a set of large diameter tubes or both the small and large diameter tubes. Each of the small diameter tubes is paired with a respective one of the large diameter tubes and flow connected to a common outlet associated with a respective row unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The one or more valves are advanceable between a low flow state in which liquid is only delivered to the set of small diameter tubes, a medium flow state in which liquid is only delivered to the set of large diameter tubes; or a high flow state in which liquid is delivered to both the small diameter tubes and the large diameter tubes. A controller communicates with the pressure sensor and the one or more valves to control the one or more valves to initially position the one or more valves in the low flow state. When the one or more valves are in the low flow state, if the pressure sensed by the pressure sensor exceeds a maximum set pressure the controller advances the one or more valves to the medium flow state. When the one or more valves are in the medium flow state, if the pressure sensed by the pressure sensor exceeds the maximum set pressure to advance the one or more valves to the high flow state or if the pressure sensed by the pressure sensor falls below a minimum set pressure to advance the one or more valves to the low flow state. Finally, when the one or more valves are in the high flow state, if the pressure sensed by the pressure sensor falls below a minimum set pressure to advance the valves to the medium flow state.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In one embodiment, the set of small diameter tubes includes at least first and second sets of small diameter tubes and the set of large diameter tubes includes at least first and second sets of large diameter tubes. Separate valves are associated with each set of small diameter tubes and each set of large diameter tubes. The controller communicates with the pressure sensor valves associated with each set of small diameter tubes and with each set of large diameter tubes to initially open only the valves associated with the small diameter tubes. When only the valves associated with the small diameter tubes are open, if the pressure sensed by the pressure sensor exceeds a maximum set pressure, the controller closes the valves associated with the small diameter tubes and opens the valves associated with the large diameter tubes. When only the valves associated with the large diameter tubes are open, if the pressure sensed by the pressure sensor exceeds the maximum set pressure, the controller opens the valves associated with the small diameter tubes while leaving the valves associated with the large diameter tubes open or if the pressure sensed by the pressure sensor falls below a minimum set pressure, the controller opens the valves associated with the small diameter tubes and closes the valves associated with the large diameter tubes. When both the valves associated with the large diameter tubes and the valves associated with the small diameter tubes are open, if the pressure sensed by the pressure sensor falls below a minimum set pressure the controller closes the valves associated with the small diameter tubes while leaving the valves associated with the large diameter tubes open.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The valves are preferably mounted on a mounting bracket which is mounted centrally or at a single location on the row unit type agricultural implement as opposed to mounting separate valves for each pair of small diameter and large diameter tubes at or near each row unit. The mounting bracket includes the valves associated with the small diameter tubes mounted in a first section or column of the bracket and the valves associated with the large diameter tubes mounted in a second section or column of the bracket.</p>

      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The components of the manifold and valve assembly <b>6</b> are mounted on a mounting bracket <b>8</b> which is configured to be bolted or otherwise secured to the frame of the agricultural implement. The manifold and valve assembly <b>8</b> includes a manifold <b>11</b> having a manifold trunk <b>12</b> and first and second manifold branches <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> extending from manifold trunk <b>12</b>. The first manifold branch <b>13</b>, or A branch, has first and second outlet tube connectors <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> connected thereto and the second manifold branch <b>14</b>, or B branch, has third and fourth outlet tube connectors <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> connected thereto.</p>

The internal diameter of each smaller diameter branch line <b>23</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>23</b>-<b>8</b> is smaller than the internal diameter of each larger diameter branch line <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>28</b>-<b>8</b>. However, the internal diameter of each group A distribution lines <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> is preferably the same as the internal diameter of the group B distribution lines <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> so that the pressure drop through distribution lines <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are generally the same.</p>

      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">A primary rate controller <b>43</b>, a pressure controller <b>44</b> and a valve controller <b>45</b> are used to control the flow of liquid through the liquid distribution lines <b>7</b> and out applicator tubes <b>31</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>31</b>-<b>8</b> based at least in part on the flow rate of the liquid in the main feed line <b>5</b> sensed by flow meter <b>46</b> and the pressure of the liquid in the main feed line <b>5</b> sensed by pressure sensor <b>47</b>. In the embodiment shown, flow meter <b>46</b>, measures the flow rate of liquid in the main feed line <b>5</b>, downstream of pump <b>4</b>. The primary controller <b>43</b> receives a signal from the flow meter <b>46</b> indicative of the flow rate of liquid in main feed line <b>5</b>. Primary controller <b>43</b> communicates with the motor <b>48</b> for pump <b>4</b> to vary the speed of the pump, to vary the flow rate through the system and to create backpressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Pressure sensor <b>47</b> is mounted on and extends into the manifold trunk <b>12</b>. The pressure controller <b>44</b> receives a signal from pressure sensor <b>47</b> indicative of the pressure of the liquid in main feed line <b>5</b>. Pressure controller <b>44</b> communicates the sensed pressure to primary rate controller <b>43</b> and valve controller <b>45</b>. Primary rate controller <b>43</b> communicates the sensed pressure to computer display <b>49</b> to display the information to an operator. Valve controller <b>45</b> communicates with and selectively opens and closes each of the valves <b>37</b>-<b>40</b> in response to changes in the pressure sensed by pressure sensor <b>47</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Operation of the system is described hereafter with reference to <figref>FIG. 3</figref> which comprises a logic diagram for the valve controller <b>45</b> of the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. In an initial step <b>201</b>, first and second valves <b>37</b> and <b>38</b>, or A valves, are set open to allow liquid to flow through the group A distribution lines <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and the smaller diameter branch lines <b>23</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>23</b>-<b>8</b> and third and fourth valves <b>39</b> and <b>40</b>, or B valves, are closed to prevent liquid from flowing through the group B distribution lines <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> and the larger diameter branch lines <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>28</b>-<b>8</b>. The pressure in group A distribution lines <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and branch lines <b>23</b>, will increase as the rate controller <b>43</b> increases the pump speed and liquid flow. When the pressure sensed by pressure sensor <b>47</b> at <b>203</b> and communicated to valve controller <b>45</b> reaches a high pressure set-point, the valve controller will open the group B valves <b>39</b> and <b>40</b> at <b>205</b> allowing liquid to flow through group B distribution lines <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> and larger diameter branch lines <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>28</b>-<b>8</b> and closes the group A valves <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> at <b>207</b> preventing liquid from flowing through the group A distribution lines <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and through the smaller diameter branch lines <b>23</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Because of the increase in the internal diameter of the tubing of the larger diameter branch lines <b>28</b> versus the smaller diameter branch lines <b>23</b>, the pressure in the distribution lines <b>7</b> and the main feed line <b>5</b> will initially decrease. If the pump speed is increased to further increase the flow rate of liquid through the distribution lines <b>7</b>, the pressure in the main feed line <b>5</b> will continue to increase. When the pressure sensed by pressure sensor <b>47</b> in the main feed line <b>5</b> reaches the high pressure set-point again at <b>209</b>, valve controller <b>45</b> will, at <b>211</b>, re-open the group A valves <b>37</b> and <b>38</b>, while leaving the group B valves <b>39</b> and <b>40</b> open so that liquid flows through both sets of distribution lines <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> and both sets of smaller and larger diameter branch lines <b>23</b> and <b>28</b>. In one embodiment the high pressure set point, might range between 50 to 75 psi and in the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is set at 65 psi for demonstrative purposes.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">With both group A and B valves <b>37</b>-<b>40</b> open, and when the flow is reduced by the rate controller, the pressure in the main feed line <b>5</b> and distribution lines <b>7</b> will drop. When the pressure sensed in the main feed line <b>5</b> by pressure sensor <b>47</b> drops below a minimum pressure set point as at <b>213</b>, the valve controller <b>45</b> is programmed to close the group A valves at <b>215</b>, blocking flow through the smaller diameter branch lines <b>23</b>. Once the group A valves are closed, the pressure in the group B distribution lines and the larger diameter branch lines <b>28</b> will initially increase to a pressure exceeding the minimum pressure set point, which in the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is set at 15 psi for demonstrative purposes. It is foreseen that set points ranging from approximately 10 to 20 psi could be utilized for the minimum pressure set point and that set points ranging from approximately 50 to 80 could be utilized for the maximum pressure set point. If flow continues to drop, the back pressure in the tubes will also continue to drop. When the pressure sensed in the main feed line <b>5</b> by pressure sensor <b>47</b> drops back down to the minimum set-point as at <b>217</b>, valve controller <b>45</b> will open the group A valves allowing flow to the smaller diameter branch lines and will close the group B valve resulting in increased back pressure throughout the distribution lines <b>7</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">It is foreseen that a single valve could be utilized to control the flow of liquid to multiple group A or group B distribution lines. The valves used may be controlled electrically, hydraulically, pneumatically or by other known means. It is also foreseen that a single valve could be used to control the fluid to all of the lines with the valve having a first position in which the main feed line or trunk line is connected to each of and only the smaller diameter branch lines, a second position in which the main feed line is connected to each of and only the larger diameter branch lines, a third position in which the main feed line is connected to each of the smaller diameter branch lines and each of the larger diameter branch lines, and a fourth or closed position in which flow is cut off between the main feed line and the smaller diameter branch lines and the larger diameter branch lines. It is also foreseen that one such four way valves could be connected between the main feed line and each paired set of group A distribution lines and group B distribution lines, or in other words one four way valve per set of group A and group B distribution lines.</p>
