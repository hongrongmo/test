      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Field of the Description</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present description relates, in general, to amusement park rides including roller coasters and other track-based rides, and, more particularly, to a new ride vehicles that are specially designed to provide passengers with new and exciting ride experiences while riding on a track. In this way, new rides and passenger experiences can be provided with new or even existing track layouts.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Relevant Background</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Amusement and theme parks are popular worldwide with hundreds of millions of people visiting the parks each year. Park operators continuously search for and research new designs for rides to continue to attract and entertain park visitors. The park operators recognize that their repeat visitor numbers will be lower and lower over the years without changes and upgrades to their rides.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Further, it is often important to build upon or modify existing rides to provide park visitors with new and exciting experiences without the cost or inconvenience of completely demolishing and replacing an existing ride with a wholly new ride. For example, it is much more desirable for a park operator to reuse an existing track and support structure than to remove these and build a completely new ride as this places a ride out of use for a longer period of time and, during construction, is more disruptive to nearby attractions.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In some cases, park operators will even try to retain ride vehicles without modification while providing a ânewâ show. For example, the theme of a ride may be changed to present sets and characters from a more recently released movie while the actual track and passenger vehicles remain unchanged. In this regard, experiences may also be changed by trying to provide additional interactivity or gaming to try to entertain the passengers.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">However, the ride experience itself has remained unchanged as the passenger vehicle travel over the same track. The passengers soon become accustomed to and, sometimes, bored with the ride experience as the passengers begin to remember each corner and its turning sensations as well as each straightaway and each rise and fall along the track. The passengers' views or lines of sight also do not change as the passenger vehicle typically faces forward such that the passengers face or look along the direction of travel (DOT) of the vehicle.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The present description teaches an amusement park ride that is specially configured to provide passengers with a new ride experience while retaining use (in most cases) of a conventional ride track to guide and support a ride vehicle along a ride path (along a direction of travel (DOT) defined by the ride track).</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The inventors recognized that conventional track-based ride vehicles include a passenger compartment (or passenger-seating compartment or passenger cabin or other similar label) that is positioned or built over the vehicle's wheels (or other track connectors). As a result, the passengers in the passenger cabin or compartment travel along the track at the same speed as the wheeled part of the vehicle (e.g., the vehicle base or body). Also, the passenger cabin or compartment turns at the same rate or speed as the vehicle's wheeled base such that the passenger motion is determined by the track configuration, including the curves in the track, and not by features of the passenger cabin or compartment.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In addition to this limitation, a problem with existing ride vehicle designs in which the passenger compartment is over the base/body and wheels is that the passengers have a line of sight that is forward along the DOT of the ride vehicle into the back of a leading vehicle/car. This causes many passengers to have their views undesirably blocked so they have difficulty seeing ride sets and interactive components as their view is often blocked by other passengers' heads or seat backs. Hence, there is a need for providing passengers both with new ride experiences in the form of speed/rates of travel that differ from that of the vehicle's base/body (or an axis of rotation passing through this portion of the ride vehicle) and with improved viewing opportunities for the passengers and/or viewpoints that can change as the ride vehicle moves between straight track sections and curves in the track.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">To address these and other problems with conventional track-based rides, the amusement park ride of the present description includes a track and ride vehicle (tracked ride vehicle) adapted for being supported upon and being guided by the track. The ride vehicle (which may be provided in a train, as an omnimover, or as a single vehicle) has base (or body) to which a track connector assembly is attached to allow the vehicle to ride upon or underneath the track (e.g., a set of bogies or wheels mating with the track). Significantly, the ride vehicle further includes a passenger compartment that is cantilevered forward of (or reward of) the bogey or wheeled base of the ride vehicle.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">For example, the passenger compartment may be spaced apart from the base (and the track-engaging wheels or track connectors) by a cantilever support element (which may also be labeled a âbridgeâ or an âarmâ). Functionally, the ride vehicle is hanging out in front (or behind) of the drive/coaster portion provided by the vehicle base. When the ride is operated to cause the ride vehicle move along the track, the cantilevered arm will negotiate curves in the track with the same angular speed as the drive/coaster portion or the wheeled vehicle base. As a result, the passenger compartment will experience amplified lateral motion and speed as compared to a conventional ride vehicle with the passenger compartment on the wheeled base.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">More particularly, an amusement park ride is provided that is adapted to provide passengers with a new ride experience including new lines of sight (e.g., unobstructed lines of sight even when in trailing vehicles) and increased turn velocities. To these and other ends, the ride includes a track defining a ride path such as a loop with a number of curves or turns. The ride includes a ride vehicle with: (a) a track connector assembly coupled to the track for movement along the ride path in a direction of travel; (b) a vehicle base mounted to the track connector assembly to move with the track connector assembly over or under the track; (c) a bridge (or cantilever support arm or boom) extending from the vehicle base; and (d) a passenger compartment with seats adapted for seating one or more passengers. The passenger compartment is mounted to the bridge such that the seats (and any passengers seated therein) are spaced apart from the base. In this way, at least a portion of the passenger compartment has cantilever mounting relative to the track connector assembly or the vehicle base.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In implementing the amusement park ride, the bridge may extend from a forward end of the vehicle base or from a rear end of the vehicle base, whereby the cantilever mounting is longitudinal relative to the direction of travel of the ride vehicle along the track. Hence, the cantilever mounting is adapted to provide fore or aft cantilever mounting of the passenger compartment such that the passenger compartment has a forward offset or a rearward offset, respectively, relative to the vehicle base and the direction of travel of the track connector assembly along the track.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The bridge may have a longitudinal axis (or an axis in a plane passing through the bridge). This longitudinal axis may be parallel to the base or track. In other cases, though, the bridge extends at a cantilever angle from the bridge that is not zero. For example, the cantilever angle may be in the range of 15 to 60 degrees (such as 30 to 45 degrees or the like) as measured between the longitudinal axis and a horizontal plane extending through the base.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The amount of cantilevering may be varied to implement the ride. In some cases, the cantilever mounting is configured so as to position the passenger compartment a cantilever distance of at least 6 feet from a rotation axis of the vehicle base. In such cases, the cantilever distance is measured between the rotation axis of the vehicle base and a proximate one of the seats in the passenger compartment. In other implementations of the ride, the cantilever mounting is configured to position the passenger compartment a cantilever distance of at least 6 feet from a proximate attachment point of the track connector assembly with the track (e.g., where a pinch drive mates with a sidewall of the track, where a front/rear set of bogies nearest to the passenger compartment couples with the track, or the like).</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In either case, the track typically will include one or more curves/bends, and the cantilever mounting achieved with the bridge is such that the seats of the passenger compartments are extended a distance (one-to-many feet) away from a right or left side of the track (depending on the direction of the curve/bend/turn in the track) as the track connector assembly and the base travel through the curves along a direction of travel. In this manner, these outward extended passenger vehicle have both unobstructed views of the surrounding ride features (e.g., set components, interactive elements, and so on) and increased velocity and/or turn forces relative (when compared with a vehicle simply mounted over the base and track connector assembly that ride over/under/on the track).</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The following description is generally directed to an amusement park ride that includes a track defining a path ride. The park ride further includes a ride vehicle with a base or body that is attached to and, in some cases, driven along the track with a connector mechanism, which may include wheels, bogies, and drives or the like. A new ride experience is achieved by the ride vehicle because the vehicle includes a passenger compartment (or cabin) that, instead of simply being positioned over the driven/rolling base, is supported upon the base/body so as to be cantilevered outward a distance from the base. This cantilevering may be provided in the fore or aft direction from the base, with âforeâ and âaftâ measured relative to the direction of travel (DOT) of the base and its connector mechanism along the ride path of the ride's track.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The ride vehicle may be a standalone vehicle or may be provided as part of a train of similar ride vehicles. The cantilevering of the passenger compartment provides the passengers in the train of vehicles unique views or lines of sight rather than simply looking at the back of the leading vehicle and its passengers (and having their views fully or partially blocked). For example, each cantilevered vehicle has a âlead vehicle-type viewâ as the train of cantilevered ride vehicles maneuvers a right or left hand turn in the track, e.g., see <figref>FIG. 6</figref> showing all of the trailing vehicles facing outward as the train takes a right hand turn so as to allow the passengers to have unobstructed views of ride elements (such as a set, interactive characters or game elements, and the like).</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">With this brief overview in mind, <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates, with more detail, one implementation of a ride vehicle <b>220</b>, which could be used in place of ride vehicle <b>120</b> in the ride <b>100</b> of <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. As shown, the ride vehicle <b>220</b> includes a planar (e.g., rectangular) base/body <b>222</b> with an upper surface <b>223</b> and a lower surface <b>225</b>. A track connector assembly <b>230</b> is mounted to the lower surface <b>225</b>, and the track connector assembly <b>230</b> is configured to rollably engaging a ride track (not shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> but can take the form of track <b>110</b> in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>). The track connector assembly <b>230</b> includes a pinch drive motor <b>232</b> that drives, such as with a belt or chain, a pinch drive <b>234</b> that engages the sidewalls of a track (or track section) and that is selectively operable to move the base/body <b>222</b> along a track in a desired DOT and at a desired speed(s).</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The track connector assembly <b>230</b> also includes one or more load wheels <b>236</b> that may roll upon a ride platform or other surfaces adjacent to a track so as to support the base/body <b>222</b> (e.g., to provide stability and/or avoid side-to-side tipping). To further provide stability, the track connector assembly <b>230</b> may include one or more guide wheels <b>238</b> for engaging the track and guiding the base <b>222</b> to follow the track. One or more up stop wheels or guides <b>239</b> may also be provided to limit the amount of vertical travel of the base <b>222</b> relative to the track or track section engaged by the pinch drive <b>234</b> and guide wheel(s) <b>238</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the ride vehicle <b>220</b> with a bottom view (or looking upward) of the base <b>222</b> and its lower surface <b>225</b> along with the components of the track connector assembly <b>230</b>. A section of ride track <b>370</b> (e.g., a T-shaped track piece) is shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> with the connector assembly <b>230</b> functioning to couple the base <b>222</b> to the track <b>370</b>. As shown, the guide wheels <b>238</b> act to contact the vertical sidewalls of the track <b>370</b> to cause the base <b>222</b> to follow the ride path defined by the length of track <b>370</b>. Also, the up stop wheel <b>239</b> is shown to contact or be proximate to the upper or horizontal portion (or âTâ) of the track <b>370</b>. Further, the pinch drive <b>234</b> is shown to contact the sidewalls of the track <b>370</b> and when operated by the pinch drive motor <b>232</b> this forces the base <b>222</b> to move along the track <b>370</b> in a DOT at a particular velocity.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The ride vehicle <b>220</b> further includes a bridge or cantilever support arm/element <b>240</b>, which is affixed to the upper surface <b>223</b> of the base <b>222</b> at a forward (or first) end <b>226</b>. To this end, the bridge <b>240</b> has an upper surface <b>242</b> and a lower surface <b>243</b>, and a rear (or first) end <b>244</b> of the bridge <b>240</b> is attached to the base <b>222</b> such as with lower surface <b>243</b> mated with the upper surface <b>223</b> of the base <b>222</b> at the end <b>226</b>. The bridge <b>240</b> is shown to be arranged to be parallel to the plane of the base <b>222</b> (or to upper surface <b>223</b> of base <b>222</b>) or, stated differently, the cantilever angle, Î¸, is zero degrees (or within several degrees of such a configuration).</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The ride vehicle <b>220</b> further includes a passenger compartment or cabin <b>250</b>. The compartment <b>250</b> includes a body or frame <b>252</b> extending from a first or front end <b>253</b> to a second or back end <b>254</b>. The body/frame <b>252</b> has a lower surface or side <b>256</b>, and the body/frame <b>252</b> is attached at the second/back end <b>254</b> to the bridge <b>240</b> such as with lower surface <b>256</b> mated with or abutting the upper surface <b>252</b> of the bridge <b>240</b> near its forward or second end <b>246</b>. The passenger compartment or cabin <b>250</b> may be attached to the bridge <b>240</b> using a fixed connection (shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) or with a rotating joint or a motion-capable joint (not shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). The passenger compartment <b>250</b> includes a first (rear) seat/bench (or row of individual seats) <b>260</b> with a back support(s)/plane <b>261</b> and a second (forward) seat/bench (or row of individual seats) <b>262</b> with a back support(s)/plane <b>263</b>. The seats <b>260</b>, <b>262</b> are provided to receive and safely support one-to-many passengers in the compartment <b>250</b>, and their design may vary with expected speeds and uses of the vehicle <b>220</b> (e.g., belting and other elements (not shown) may be provided and designed to suit planned speeds for the vehicle <b>220</b>, banking of the track, vertical rises/drops, and the like).</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The bridge <b>240</b> can said to be cantilevered in relation to the base <b>222</b> as it can be seen that a length of the bridge <b>240</b> extends outward from the end <b>226</b> of the base <b>222</b> (e.g., a length of the lower surface <b>243</b> of the bridge <b>240</b> is not directly in contact with or supported by the upper surface <b>223</b> of the base <b>222</b>). Since the bridge <b>240</b> is a cantilevered beam or arm, the passenger compartment <b>250</b>, which is positioned on the end <b>246</b> of the bridge <b>240</b> that is distal to the edge/end <b>226</b> of the base <b>222</b>, is supported in a cantilevered manner relative to the base <b>222</b> in the ride vehicle <b>220</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates with a functional block or schematic diagram of an amusement park ride <b>100</b> of the present description. <figref>FIG. 3</figref> provides a partial view of the ride <b>100</b> with only a portion of a track <b>110</b> and a single ride vehicle (or ride vehicle assembly) <b>120</b> being shown for ease of explanation of the ride <b>100</b> with it being understood that a typical ride would include numerous vehicles <b>120</b> that may move independently (as shown) or be part of a train of such vehicles <b>120</b>. The track <b>110</b> defines a ride path that typically would be a loop, which begins and ends in a station for loading and unloading of passengers, and the loop would include a plurality of right and/or left hand curves as well as straight lengths or sections (âstraightawaysâ). The ride vehicle <b>120</b> typically will move along the track <b>110</b> in a direction of travel (DOT) as shown with arrow <b>112</b>, e.g., a DOT may chosen such the passengers <b>138</b> face in the direction which the vehicle <b>120</b> is moving along the track <b>110</b>. The DOT as shown with arrow <b>112</b> is generally along the longitudinal axis of the track <b>110</b> or parallel to the track <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The ride <b>100</b> includes the ride vehicle <b>120</b> with a vehicle base (or body) <b>112</b> that is coupled to or supported upon the track <b>110</b> via a track connector assembly <b>124</b>. The base <b>122</b> is shown to be supported above the track <b>110</b>, but the ride <b>100</b> may also be implemented with a base <b>122</b> supported or hung below the track <b>110</b> (and with cantilevered passenger compartment <b>130</b> below the track <b>110</b>). The vehicle base <b>122</b> may take a wide variety of forms as it generally acts as a support platform or chassis for the compartment/cabin <b>130</b> upon the track connector assembly <b>124</b>. In some cases, the base <b>122</b> is provided as a simple planar frame while in others it takes a more complex form that may help to implement a ride them or to disguise the existence of the connector assembly <b>124</b> and/or the track <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">During operation of the ride <b>100</b>, the base <b>122</b>, and the passenger compartment <b>130</b> mounted onto the base <b>122</b>, moves along the track <b>110</b> at a velocity, V<sub>vehicle</sub>, as shown with arrow <b>126</b>. To this end, the track connector assembly <b>124</b> may include bogies, wheels, or other components that allow the base <b>122</b> to roll along the track <b>110</b> while coupling the base <b>122</b> to the track <b>110</b> such that the base <b>122</b> does not lift off the track <b>122</b> (or fall from the track <b>122</b> when supported from above). The track connector assembly <b>124</b> may include bogies or similar components when the track <b>110</b> defines a gravity-based ride <b>100</b> such as a roller coaster. In some implementations of ride <b>100</b>, the track connector assembly <b>124</b> may also include one or more drive mechanisms to cause the base <b>122</b> to move in the DOT shown by arrow <b>112</b> at the vehicle velocity, V<sub>vehicle</sub>, shown by arrow <b>126</b>. The particular coupling components, rolling/track engaging components, braking components, drive mechanisms, and the like provide in the track connector assembly <b>124</b> are not limiting to the ride <b>100</b> as nearly any arrangement may be used to implement the assembly <b>124</b> (e.g., any drive and wheel/bogie arrangement know (or to be developed) in the amusement park ride industry may be utilized).</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">In a conventional ride, a passenger compartment would be positioned directly upon the base <b>122</b>. For example, the compartment could be centered upon the base <b>122</b> such that it rotates and moves with the base <b>122</b> as the base <b>122</b> moves along the DOT <b>122</b>. This would include rotation about the base's axis of rotation, Axis<sub>Rotation</sub>, which may extend through the base <b>122</b> and connector assembly <b>124</b> (such as through the center of the chassis of connector assembly or between fore and aft wheels/bogies in connector assembly <b>124</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In contrast, the ride <b>100</b> is adapted to provide a passenger <b>138</b> in a passenger compartment or cabin <b>130</b> a unique ride experience or at least a ride experience that differs from that provided to a passenger in a compartment mounted directly to the base <b>122</b>. To this end, the passenger compartment <b>130</b> includes a seat/bench <b>132</b> with a back or back support <b>133</b>, and a passenger <b>138</b> is positioned in the passenger compartment <b>130</b> upon the bench/seat <b>132</b> with their back/upper body supported by or against the back/support <b>133</b>. The passenger compartment <b>130</b> is not mounted directly to the base <b>122</b> over the track connector assembly <b>124</b>. Instead, the passenger compartment <b>130</b> is mounted in the ride vehicle <b>120</b> so as to be spaced apart a distance from the axis of rotation, Axis<sub>Rotation</sub>, of the vehicle base <b>122</b> with cantilever mounting relative to the base <b>122</b> (or its upper or another mounting surface).</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">More specifically, the ride vehicle <b>120</b> includes a cantilever support element or bridge <b>140</b> that is used to mount the passenger compartment or cabin <b>130</b> to the vehicle base <b>122</b>. The bridge <b>140</b> may take a wide variety of forms to act to space the compartment away from the base <b>122</b> (or provide cantilevered mounting) such as one or more linear (or non-linear) arms or beams. A first end <b>142</b> of the bridge <b>140</b> is affixed to the vehicle base <b>122</b>, such as to the forward or rear portion of the upper surface of the base <b>122</b>, while the compartment or its body <b>130</b> is affixed to a second end <b>144</b> of the bridge <b>140</b>. The bridge <b>140</b> may be arranged at a cantilever angle, Î¸, that may range from 0 degrees (bridge <b>140</b> having its longitudinal axis parallel to a horizontal plane passing through the base <b>122</b> or to a longitudinal axis of the track <b>110</b>) up to about 60 degrees (e.g., 30 to 45 degrees being useful in some elevated compartment embodiments of the ride <b>100</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The amount of cantilevering of the compartment <b>130</b> may also be varied to implement the ride <b>100</b> and may also be measured in a number of ways. For example, the amount of cantilever or cantilever distance (or compartment offset), ad, d<sub>cantilever 1</sub>, may be measured as the distance between the rotation axis, Axis<sub>Rotation</sub>, of the vehicle base <b>122</b> and a back support <b>133</b> of the passenger seat <b>132</b> (or location of the passenger or the rearmost or forwardmost passenger). In other cases, the cantilever distance, d<sub>cantilever 2</sub>, may be measured as the distance between the back support <b>133</b> (or measured so as to coincided with a location of a passenger in the compartment <b>130</b>) and a front edge or front axle (or wheel rotation axis) of the track connector assembly <b>124</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The cantilever amount or distance may be a relatively small amount such as 1 to 6 feet such as when the passenger compartment or cabin <b>130</b> is configured with one bench <b>132</b> or two to three seats <b>132</b> in a row. In other cases, though, the cantilever amount or distance is much larger such as 6 to 20 feet or more such as when the vehicle <b>120</b> is provided in a vehicle train and it is desirable to position a trailing vehicle compartment over a leading vehicle base (e.g., see <figref>FIGS. 5-10</figref>) or when there are two to six or more rows of seats <b>132</b> or benches <b>132</b> in the passenger compartment <b>130</b>. In some cases, the amount of cantilever is chosen based on the size of the base <b>122</b> or the track connector assembly <b>124</b> such as to have a cantilever amount that is at least one half of the base <b>122</b> or connector assembly <b>125</b> length (as measured along the longitudinal axis of the track <b>110</b> or along the DOT <b>112</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The direction of the cantilevering provided by the bridge <b>140</b> is typically either in a forward direction or in a rearward direction (i.e., fore or aft cantilevering) relative to the base <b>122</b> (or the axis of rotation, Axis<sub>Rotation</sub>). In <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the ride <b>100</b> is shown to include ride vehicles <b>120</b> with fore cantilevering with the bridge <b>140</b> positioning the compartment <b>130</b> forward of the base <b>122</b> relative to the DOT <b>112</b>, e.g., the compartment <b>130</b> travels ahead along the track <b>110</b> ahead of or leading the supporting but trailing vehicle base <b>122</b>. This causes the compartment <b>120</b> to extend outward into space (not be directly above or below the track <b>110</b>) when the vehicle <b>120</b> moves through curves in the track <b>110</b> (again, see <figref>FIGS. 5-10</figref> for examples of this phenomenon). In other cases, the cantilevering would be aft cantilevering with the bridge <b>140</b> arranged to position the compartment <b>130</b> away from and behind the base <b>122</b> such that the compartment follows or trails the base <b>122</b> as it moves in the DOT <b>112</b> along the track <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The bridge <b>142</b> further is arranged to provide the cantilevering in a generally longitudinal manner, e.g., with the axis of the bridge/support arm <b>140</b> generally parallel to (e.g., a range of â15 to +15 degrees from) longitudinal axes of the base <b>122</b> and the track <b>110</b> (at least when measured in straight sections of the track <b>110</b>) or parallel to the DOT <b>112</b> in a straight section of the track <b>110</b>. In other words, the bridge <b>140</b> is not arranged on the base <b>122</b> so as to be orthogonal to the track <b>110</b> (e.g., when viewed from above).</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows a ride vehicle <b>220</b> with fore or forward cantilevering. In contrast, <figref>FIG. 4</figref> shows a ride vehicle <b>420</b> with aft or rearward cantilevering. The ride vehicle <b>420</b> may be implemented with many of the same components as used in ride vehicle <b>220</b> including the base <b>222</b> and the cantilevered support arm or bridge <b>240</b>. In fact, the bridge <b>240</b> may be mounted on the same end <b>226</b> of the base <b>222</b>. However, the DOT as shown with arrow <b>421</b> for vehicle <b>420</b> is opposite that DOT of the vehicle <b>220</b> (which would have been to the left in the plane of the image shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). In this way, a passenger compartment <b>450</b> in the ride vehicle <b>420</b> trails or follows behind the base <b>222</b> as the track connector assembly <b>230</b> is operated to move the ride vehicle <b>420</b> in the DOT <b>421</b>, which provides a much different ride experience when compared with conventional ride vehicles and even when compared with the forward cantilevering in ride vehicle <b>220</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Particularly, the ride vehicle <b>420</b> includes a passenger compartment <b>450</b> mounted onto the upper surface <b>242</b> of the bridge <b>240</b> near the end <b>246</b>, which is spaced apart from the end <b>226</b> of the base such that the bridge <b>240</b> is cantilevered relative to its support (i.e., the base <b>222</b>). The passenger compartment <b>450</b> is arranged to allow passengers to face forward with the DOT <b>421</b> or towards the base <b>222</b> rather than away from the base <b>222</b> as shown in vehicle <b>220</b>. The passenger compartment <b>450</b> is similar to compartment <b>250</b> in that it includes a first (rear) seat/bench (or row of individual seats) <b>460</b> with a back support(s)/plane <b>461</b> and a second (forward) seat/bench (or row of individual seats) <b>462</b> with a back support(s)/plane <b>463</b>. The seats <b>460</b>, <b>462</b> are provided to receive and safely support one-to-many passengers in the compartment <b>450</b>, and their design may vary with expected speeds and uses of the vehicle <b>420</b> as discussed above.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">As discussed above, the bridge <b>240</b> can said to be cantilevered in relation to the base <b>222</b> as it can be seen that a length of the bridge <b>240</b> extends outward from the end <b>226</b> of the base <b>222</b>. Since the bridge <b>240</b> is a cantilevered beam or arm, the passenger compartment <b>450</b>, which is positioned on the end <b>246</b> of the bridge <b>240</b> that is distal to the edge/end <b>226</b> of the base <b>222</b>, is supported in a cantilevered manner relative to the base <b>222</b> in the ride vehicle <b>220</b>. The amount of cantilever may be stated as the amount of bridge <b>240</b> that is unsupported or an exposed portion of lower surface <b>243</b>, e.g., 1 to 15 feet or more. More typically, the amount of cantilever may be stated as the distance of the most forward bench/seat's back surface/plane <b>463</b> from either the base's rotation axis, Axis<sub>Rotation</sub>, as shown as d<sub>cantilever1 </sub>(e.g., 5 to 10 feet or more) or the forward/proximate engaging portion of the connector <b>230</b> with the track (e.g., the rotation axis of the pinch drive <b>234</b>) as shown as d<sub>cantilever3 </sub>(e.g., 2 to 7 feet or more). In other cases, it may be useful to state a maximum amount of cantilever such as with a measurement from the most rear or most distal seats/benches <b>460</b> or their back supports <b>261</b> from the base <b>222</b> such as its rotation axis, Axis<sub>Rotation</sub>, as shown as d<sub>cantilever2 </sub>(e.g., 8 to 15 feet or more).</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">With some exemplary cantilevered ride vehicles understood, it may be useful to describe operation of a ride that makes use of such vehicles in a train to obtain desirable and new ride experiences. <figref>FIGS. 5-9</figref> illustrate an amusement park ride <b>500</b> with a top view or with an aerial view. As shown, the ride <b>500</b> includes a track <b>510</b> with a support or ride platform <b>514</b>, and each ride vehicle, as discussed with reference to <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, is adapted to couple and ride on the track <b>510</b> (such as with guide wheels and a pinch drive or the like) and to also be supported on upper/contact surfaces of the platform (such as with load wheels or the like).</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The ride <b>500</b> further includes a vehicle train <b>520</b> made up of ride vehicle <b>530</b>, ride vehicle <b>540</b>, ride vehicle <b>542</b>, and ride vehicle <b>546</b> that are interconnected to move in a DOT <b>580</b> as a unit. The vehicle <b>546</b> is the lead car in the train <b>520</b> with each of the other vehicles being trail cars/vehicles. In <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, vehicle <b>530</b> is shown to include a base/body <b>532</b> that, although not shown, includes a track connector (such as the assembly <b>124</b> or assembly <b>230</b>) to couple with the track <b>510</b> (and, when useful, to drive the vehicle <b>530</b> on the track <b>510</b> in DOT <b>580</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The vehicle <b>530</b> also includes a passenger compartment <b>530</b> that is supported in a cantilevered manner from base <b>532</b> with the arm or bridge <b>534</b> that extends outward a distance from the base <b>532</b>. The arm/bridge <b>534</b> has it longitudinal axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the base <b>532</b> and, in the straight section of track <b>510</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, parallel to the track <b>510</b> and the DOT <b>580</b>. The passenger compartment <b>536</b> typically is configured with its seats/benches arranged to cause seated passengers (not shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>) to face forward or in the DOT <b>580</b>. Each of other vehicles <b>540</b>, <b>542</b>, <b>546</b> also includes a passenger compartment, a base coupled to the track <b>510</b>, and a bridge/cantilever support arm such that their passenger compartments are also supported in a cantilevered manner relative to their bases/bodies.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">As shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, passenger compartments are cantilevered in an amount such that a trailing vehicle's passenger compartment is placed over the leading vehicle's base. In the straight section of track <b>510</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, each of the vehicles <b>530</b>, <b>540</b>, <b>542</b>, <b>546</b> have their components including their passenger compartments aligned in a linear manner. The train <b>520</b>, in other words, provides a ride experience similar to that of a conventional vehicle train in these sections with a leading passenger compartment being in the line of sight of a trailing vehicle, e.g., passengers in the compartment <b>536</b> of vehicle <b>530</b> have their light of sight along the DOT <b>580</b> block or partially obscured by passengers in the compartments (or by the compartments themselves) of vehicles <b>540</b>, <b>542</b>, <b>546</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">However, as shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the use of cantilevered ride vehicles <b>530</b>, <b>540</b>, <b>542</b>, <b>546</b> in the vehicle train <b>520</b> produces a much different result as the train <b>520</b> moves through non-straight or curved portions of the track <b>510</b>. As shown, the train <b>520</b> is moving in a DOT <b>581</b> that is a fairly sharp right hand turn in the track <b>510</b>, e.g., a 180-degree turn. With the cantilevered compartments, each compartment has an unobstructed view to the left or outside of the track <b>510</b>. This can be seen with the trailing ride vehicle <b>530</b> having its passenger compartment <b>536</b> extending outward from the base <b>532</b> and also a distance from the track <b>510</b>. Similarly, the next leading vehicle <b>540</b> has its compartment extending outward from a base <b>640</b> via cantilevered mounting with arm/bridge <b>641</b>. Its view is not blocked by the vehicle <b>542</b>. The vehicle <b>542</b> has it compartment extending outward from the track <b>510</b> with an unobstructed view, and the compartment is cantilevered via arm <b>643</b> extending outward a distance form base <b>642</b>. Finally, vehicle <b>546</b> extends outward from the track <b>510</b> with its cantilevered mounting from base <b>644</b> via arm/bridge <b>645</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">It can be seen that this produces a much different ride experience than if the passenger compartments were mounted over or on the bases in each vehicle <b>530</b>, <b>540</b>, <b>542</b>, <b>546</b>. The passengers not only obtain a different view but the feel or sensations of the ride differ as the cantilevering away from the rotation axis (fore or aft longitudinally along the DOT) of the base increases the velocity of the passengers (and corresponding forces applied to the passengers as the vehicles maneuver turns).</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Instead of a full left or right hand turn, the track may include smaller turns back and forth or minor bends, and a train with cantilevered passenger compartments will provide passengers with a unique ride experience as these track sections are traveled with a DOT as shown with arrow <b>582</b>. For example, <figref>FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the vehicle train <b>520</b> as it travels through a section of the track <b>510</b> that includes a number of minor and opposite bends (e.g., one or more S-sections). The lead vehicle <b>546</b> is shown in its more conventional arrangement after the bends section of track with the passenger compartment and base <b>644</b> fully or mostly over the track <b>510</b>. The last vehicle <b>530</b> is just entering the bends section of track <b>510</b> with the base <b>532</b> over the track <b>510</b> but passenger compartment beginning to move off or away from the track <b>510</b>. The vehicle <b>540</b> leads vehicle <b>530</b> and is further along the bends section of track <b>510</b> and the base <b>640</b> is over the track <b>510</b> while the cantilevered compartment extend out from and/or away from the track <b>510</b> but from an opposite side relative to trailing vehicle <b>530</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The vehicle <b>542</b> has moved yet further along the track <b>510</b> and its passenger compartment extend away from the track <b>510</b> but in the opposite direction relative to its trailing vehicle <b>540</b>. As can be seen, the use of cantilevered ride vehicles in the train <b>520</b> causes the passenger compartments magnify or amplify the turning of the bases of the vehicles in this section of the track <b>510</b>. For example, base <b>642</b> of vehicle <b>542</b> shows where a convention passenger compartment would be relative to the track <b>510</b> while the passenger compartment of trailing vehicle <b>540</b> shows that cantilevering causes the compartment to be follow a ride path with exaggerated or larger movements in curves such as the bends in the section of track <b>510</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>. The amount of magnification or amplification can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the amount of cantilever (or the cantilever distance) for the passenger compartments such as by increasing the length of the bridges/support arms.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">
        <figref>FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the ride <b>500</b> when the vehicle train <b>520</b> is moving with DOT <b>583</b> through a left hand 180-degree turn or bend in track <b>510</b>. The movement of the vehicles <b>530</b>, <b>540</b>, <b>542</b>, and <b>546</b> are similar to those seen in <figref>FIG. 6</figref> but a mirror image, e.g., with passenger compartments extending out from the right side of the track <b>510</b> rather than from the left side of the track <b>510</b>. Again, though, each of the passenger compartments is offset from the track and also from the next or leading vehicle's base. <figref>FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the ride <b>500</b> as the train <b>520</b> moves through a similar left hand 180-degree turn and moves in DOT <b>584</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">A near miss experience is achieved when the track <b>510</b> of ride <b>500</b> is configured with the two 180-degree turns shown in <figref>FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> placed nearby. In this way, the train passengers have their compartments extends outward from the track <b>510</b> and also toward an oncoming train with its passengers and passenger compartments. Such a ânear missâ is achieved while the sections of track <b>510</b> remain relatively far apart as the extension or offsetting of the passenger compartments from the track causes or heightens the sense of impending collision or danger.</p>

The ride vehicles are inexpensive to implement. The ride vehicles add new motion and visual possibilities for the passengers of tracked vehicle rides. In some cases, the vehicles provide dramatic lateral movement, and this movement of a preceding or leading vehicle in a train will provide passengers in the trailing vehicle new and interesting viewpoints, e.g., a preceding vehicle may suddenly swing out and away in a track curve opening up views for passengers in a next or trailing vehicle. In this regard, when all vehicles in a train are similarly cantilevered (which is not a requirement as some embodiments will have vehicles with differing amounts or types (angled or non-angled) cantilevering), every vehicle moving along a track will have the same visuals as the first vehicle in a train.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">In embodiments using reversed or rearward cantilevered passenger compartments, the cantilever of the passenger vehicle relative to the wheeled base/body gives a drift effect that is a new ride experience not presently available in track-based amusement park rides. In general, the amusement park rides described herein teach ride vehicles with the passenger compartment or cabin longitudinally offset from the base/body of the vehicle such as may be measured from a base's rotation axis passing through or near the track connector(s) or from a front axle or a rear axle of a wheeled/bogied vehicle base.</p>
