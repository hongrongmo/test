      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to an assembly-type toy, and in particular to an assembly-type toy wherein an engaging part is accommodated projectable form an outer side of a toy block, and a plurality of toy blocks may be interconnected to one another.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In general, an assembly-type toy may be categorized into a type for finishing a desired toy with a predetermined shape by stacking a plurality of toy blocks, and a type for finishing a desired toy with a predetermined shape by engaging a plurality of toy blocks each having at least one or more than one engaging protrusion and a plurality of engaging grooves the number of which corresponds to the number of the engaging protrusions (hereinafter referred to as âstacking-type toyâ).</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In addition, there is another type of a toy wherein a plurality of toy blocks are engaged using an adhesive like a plastic model, thus finishing a previously set type of a finished toy (hereinafter referred to as âengaging-type toyâ).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">However, in case of the stacking-type toy, an engaging force between the neighboring toy blocks is weak, so the configuration of the finished toy may easily collapse down even when a slight external impact is exerted thereon after the toy is assembled into a predetermined shape. In addition, in case of the adhering-type toy, the finished toy cannot be disassembled once it is assembled into a finished toy, and even when the finished toy is disassembled, it is impossible to make another desired shape using the disassembled toy.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Therefore, the assembly-type toys in general usable for the development of kids intelligence, playing, etc. mainly is the engaging-type toy. Here, <figref>FIGS. 27 to 29</figref> show various types of typical assembly-type toys which are disclosed in the Korean Patent Nos. 0250896, 0360083, and 0128830.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Referring to <figref>FIG. 27</figref>, it is confirmable that a toy block <b>110</b> is connected to another toy block <b>110</b> by inserting an engaging rod <b>130</b> into the toy block <b>110</b> which has a plurality of engaging holes <b>120</b>. However, in this case, any effect may not be exerted on the engaging force in a state where the toy blocks are placed on the ground. When a user lifts up the toy block <b>110</b>, the engaging rod <b>130</b> may gradually separate from the corresponding engaging hole <b>120</b>, and the configuration that a plurality of the toy blocks <b>110</b> maintain may become unstable. In this case, if a user does a careless thing, a plurality of the toy blocks <b>110</b> may separate, thus collapsing down the previously assembled configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">
        <figref>FIG. 28</figref> shows a toy block <b>210</b> wherein a plurality of insertion protrusions <b>220</b> and a plurality of connection holes <b>230</b> are formed on the surfaces at regular intervals. In this configuration, it is possible for a user to make a desired configuration in such a way to connect a toy block <b>210</b> with another one while matching the positions of the corresponding insertion protrusions <b>220</b> and connecting holes <b>230</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">However, in case where it is intended to engage a plurality of toy blocks <b>210</b>, the engaging force between the insertion protrusions <b>220</b> and the connecting holes <b>230</b> may become weak because of the increased weight of the toy blocks <b>210</b>. If the increasing weight reaches a predetermined level of weight, they start to separate, so the previously assembled configuration may collapse down.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 29</figref>, there is provided an assembly-type toy wherein one surface thereof, a plurality of engaging protrusions <b>320</b> are arranged uniform at regular intervals, and on the other surface thereof, a plurality of engaging grooves <b>330</b> are arranged uniform at regular intervals. This configuration allows to increase the engaging force with the aid of a plurality of the engaging protrusion <b>320</b> and a plurality of the corresponding engaging grooves <b>330</b>, however in case where a number of toy blocks <b>310</b> are intended to be engaged, the engaging force may become weak because of the increased weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In case of the assembly-type toy as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 28 and 29</figref>, it is hard to arrange clean the insertion protrusions <b>220</b> or the engaging protrusions <b>320</b> which are not used for the assembly after the assembling is finished, entailing rough outer appearance and dirty states. In addition, a relative rotation is impossible between the toy blocks at the engaging part. In case of the assembly-type toy as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 27</figref>, if a rotation occurs between the neighboring toy blocks, the engaging rod <b>130</b> may slip, which makes it impossible for the engaging rod <b>130</b> to separate from the engaging hole <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">For the above-described problems, a corresponding technical field needs to a develop a new assembly-type toy wherein it can withstand a heavy eight even if a plurality of toy blocks are connected, while maintaining a reliable engaging force between the toy blocks, and a relative rotation is possible between the toy blocks, and the outer appearance may look clean since the protruding portions can be made clean after the toy blocks are all assembled.</p>
