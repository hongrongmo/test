      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to medical devices. More particularly, the invention relates to an occlusion device for occluding a lumen of a body vessel.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Background</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Vascular occlusion devices are surgical implants that are placed within the vascular system of a patient. There are a number of reasons why it may be desirable to occlude a vessel. For example, the site of a stroke or other vascular accident can be treated by placing an occlusion device proximal of the site to block the flow of blood to the site, thereby alleviating leakage at the site. An aneurysm can be treated by the introduction of an occlusion device through the neck of the aneurysm. Tumours can be treated by occluding the flow of blood to a targeted site of interest.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Several known occlusion devices include a coiled apparatus which is capable of being deployed into a body vessel or body cavity. In some cases, occlusion can be achieved with the deposition of a single coil. In other cases, multiple coils must be deployed to the occlusion site, prolonging the procedure. Furthermore, it cannot always be predicted how many coils may need to be introduced to a particular site. In some cases, the coils are made of expensive materials, such as platinum, thereby increasing both the cost and complexity of such procedures.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">While these occlusion devices can provide effective occlusion, there is a need for a single device that can be deployed to the body cavity or body vessel to be occluded to affect occlusion in a single step.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">One embodiment of an occlusion device, having a longitudinal axis, generally includes a plurality of outer coiled elements having a first proximal end extending distally to a first distal end, each outer coiled element having a first diameter and a first length dimension. In this case, the first length dimension may be substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis. The plurality of outer coiled elements may define a device body having a proximal device end extending distally to a distal device end and an interior device lumen disposed therethrough. The device body may include a body outer surface disposed about the interior device lumen wherein each outer coiled element is disposed about the body outer surface. The device body may further have a device midpoint disposed substantially halfway between the proximal device end and the distal device end.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The occlusion device further includes a plurality of inner coiled elements disposed in the interior device lumen, each inner coiled element having a second proximal end extending distally to a second distal end, each inner coiled element having a second length dimension and a second diameter, the second diameter may be less than the first diameter of any of the plurality of outer coiled elements.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The occlusion device further has a proximal cap disposed at the proximal device end, the proximal cap comprising a first interior portion and a first exterior portion, the first proximal ends of the outer coiled elements and the second proximal ends of the inner coiled elements being fixed within the first interior portion of the proximal cap.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In another embodiment, an occlusion device includes an outer coiled element, similar to the outer coiled elements discussed above. The outer coiled element may have a first proximal end extending distally to a first distal end, the outer coiled element having a first diameter and a first length dimension. The first length dimension may be substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis, the outer coiled element comprising a series of first coil loops</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Each first coil loop may have a radius, each first coil loop being spaced substantially equidistant from the first coil loop proximal to and distal to it. The radius of each first coil loop may be larger than that of the first coil loop proximal to it. The first coil loops may define a device body having a proximal device end extending distally to a distal device end and an interior device lumen disposed therethrough, the device body comprising a body outer surface disposed about the interior device lumen wherein each outer coiled element is disposed about the body outer surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The occlusion device may further include a plurality of inner coiled elements disposed in the interior device lumen, each inner coiled element having a second proximal end extending distally to a second distal end, each inner coiled element having a second length dimension and a second diameter, the second diameter being less than the first diameter of the outer coiled element. The device may also include a proximal cap disposed at the proximal device end, the proximal cap comprising a first interior portion and a first exterior portion, the first proximal end of the outer coiled element and the second proximal ends of the inner coiled elements being fixed within the first interior portion of the proximal cap.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of delivering an occlusion device to a body vessel or a body cavity. The method includes providing a delivery sheath having an interior lumen and an occlusion device, the occlusion device as discussed herein having a plurality of outer coiled elements, a plurality of inner coiled elements, and a proximal cap.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The occlusion device may further include a constrained configuration wherein the device body has a constrained length and a constrained diameter and an unconstrained configuration wherein the device body has an unconstrained length and an unconstrained diameter. The constrained length may be greater than the unconstrained length. The constrained diameter may be smaller than the unconstrained diameter.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The method further includes disposing the device in its constrained configuration within the interior lumen of the delivery sheath, and delivering the device percutaneously to a body vessel using the delivery sheath.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Further objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from consideration of the following description and the appended claims when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p>

      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The present disclosure generally provides an occlusion device which can be used with any suitable occlusion device delivery system by a physician to deliver an occlusion device into a body vessel or a cavity of a patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Referring to <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>, one embodiment of an occlusion device <b>10</b> is depicted inside a delivery catheter <b>80</b>. The occlusion device <b>10</b> generally comprises a plurality of outer coils or outer coiled elements <b>12</b> and a plurality of inner coils or inner coiled elements <b>14</b>. The outer coiled elements may have a first length dimension substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">These outer coiled elements may define a device body having a device proximal end <b>20</b> extending distally to a distal device end <b>30</b>. The device body may include a body outer surface and each outer coiled element is disposed about the body outer surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In this embodiment, there is a proximal cap <b>28</b> located at the proximal end of the device and a distal cap <b>38</b> at the device distal end. In this embodiment, proximal loop or engagement loop <b>24</b> is attached to an outer surface of proximal cap <b>28</b>, and distal loop <b>34</b> is attached to an outer surface of proximal cap <b>28</b>. As depicted, this occlusion device <b>10</b> is positioned within catheter lumen <b>82</b> of delivery catheter <b>80</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The occlusion device <b>10</b> is depicted in a first configuration <b>11</b>. When the device <b>10</b> is in first configuration <b>11</b>, it has a first length <b>17</b> and defines a first device diameter <b>19</b>. The device is configured to expand radially in order to fill the vessel, cavity, or delivery apparatus in which it is placed, therefore making device diameter <b>19</b> equal to the diameter of the catheter <b>80</b>. The device diameter <b>19</b> can also be considered a height dimension for the device. Substantially halfway along the first length <b>17</b>, between the proximal end <b>20</b> and the distal end <b>30</b>, is device midpoint <b>40</b>, which falls along a longitudinal axis <b>41</b>. The occlusion device <b>10</b> can be used in a number of contexts: for occlusion of a blood vessel, for instance, or to fill an aneurysm.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The plurality of outer coils <b>12</b> are disposed about and comprise a device circumference or body outer surface <b>50</b> of the device <b>10</b>. The outer coils <b>12</b> also define a device lumen <b>60</b> interior to the outer coils <b>12</b>. The plurality of inner coils <b>14</b> are located within the device lumen <b>60</b>. The longitudinal axis <b>41</b> runs through the device lumen <b>60</b>. Optionally, the first length <b>17</b> can be measured along the longitudinal axis <b>41</b>. A circle can be drawn along a portion of device circumference <b>50</b> using device midpoint <b>40</b> as its center to define a central lumen plane.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In certain embodiments, the proximal end <b>20</b> and the distal end <b>30</b> of device <b>10</b> may be indistinguishable from one another. If there is no distinguishing characteristic incorporated in the device <b>10</b> which differentiates proximal end <b>20</b> from distal end <b>30</b>, the device may be reversible; that is, either end may be termed the proximal or the distal end. In other embodiments, the device <b>10</b> may have a distinct proximal end <b>20</b> as compared to the distal end <b>30</b>. For instance, a radiopaque marker may be incorporated into the device at a certain point, defining polarity of the device. For example, the optional distal loop <b>34</b> may be left off. The single-looped device may then have a proximal end <b>20</b> with a proximal cap <b>28</b> having proximal loop <b>24</b> thereon, and distal end <b>30</b> with a cap <b>38</b> that lacks a loop.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">With respect to <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>, a cross sectional view along line <b>1</b>B of the device of <figref>FIG. 1A</figref> is shown. The outer coiled elements <b>12</b> are shown disposed about and defining the device circumference <b>50</b> and forming the outer limit of device lumen <b>60</b>. At the center of device lumen <b>60</b> is device center <b>70</b>, which is coincident with the longitudinal axis <b>41</b> of the device as it passes through the space occupied by the device <b>10</b>. In the embodiment depicted, the device <b>10</b> comprises five outer coils <b>12</b>. However, other numbers of outer coils are possible. A device may have as few as three outer coils <b>12</b>, but may also have four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or more than ten outer coils <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, the outer coils <b>12</b> are evenly spaced about the device center <b>70</b> along device circumference <b>50</b>. In other embodiments, they may be unevenly spaced.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">As depicted in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>, one of the outer coils <b>12</b> has a first outer coil diameter <b>71</b> while another has second outer coil diameter <b>72</b>. In one embodiment, the first outer coil diameter <b>71</b> is substantially the same as second outer coil diameter <b>72</b>. In another embodiment, first outer coil diameter <b>71</b> is substantially larger than second outer coil diameter <b>72</b>. It may be preferable in certain embodiments to have outer coils <b>12</b> that all have the same diameters. In other embodiments, it may be preferable to have one or more of the plurality of outer coils <b>12</b> that have different diameters from the other outer coils <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The plurality of inner coils <b>14</b> is shown in the lumen <b>60</b> of device <b>10</b>. The number of inner coils <b>14</b> can be varied based on the properties of the coils selected for use as inner coils and based on the overall diameter of the device lumen <b>60</b>. In some embodiments, five or more inner coils <b>14</b> will be employed; in other embodiments, ten or more inner coils <b>14</b> will be included; in still other embodiments, twelve, fifteen, twenty, or more inner coils <b>14</b> will be included in the lumen <b>60</b> of device <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">As depicted in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>, one of the outer coils <b>14</b> has a first inner coil diameter <b>73</b> while another has second inner coil diameter <b>74</b>. In one embodiment, the first inner coil diameter <b>73</b> is substantially the same as second inner coil diameter <b>74</b>. In another embodiment, first inner coil diameter <b>73</b> is substantially larger than second inner coil diameter <b>74</b>. It may be preferable in certain embodiments to have outer coils <b>14</b> that all have the same diameters. In other embodiments, it may be preferable to have one or more of the plurality of inner coils <b>14</b> that have different diameters from the other inner coils <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Referring to <figref>FIG. 1C</figref>, an individual outer coil <b>12</b> is depicted. The outer coil <b>12</b> comprises a number of windings from the first proximal end <b>15</b> to the distal end. In one embodiment, the first winding lengths <b>13</b> between equivalent points on consecutive windings of the coil are equal along the entire length of the coil. The windings can extend from the proximal device end <b>20</b> to the distal device end. The outer coil <b>12</b> also has a first coil height <b>21</b>, which is defined as the diameter of the largest coil winding. In certain embodiments, the heights of each coil winding segment are all equal to one another along the length of the coil. In other embodiments, the coil winding segment at the proximal end <b>15</b> of the coil may have a height dimension which is substantially smaller than the one distal to it, and the next coil winding segment may be have a substantially larger height to that coil winding segment. This would result in a tapered coil with the largest coil winding segment height at its distal end, bearing a resemblance in shape for instance to the Cook TORNADO embolization coil or a coil of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,797,953, which incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The outer coils <b>12</b> can in some embodiments have a greater stiffness than the inner coiled elements <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, the outer coils <b>12</b> are made of a metal alloy with high stiffness, such as Inconel or elgiloy. Inconels are alloys of varying composition that are primarily nickel alloyed with a smaller amount of chromium and other metals. Inconel alloys are oxidation and corrosion resistant materials well suited for medical device applications. Compressing an Inconel assembly such as outer coils <b>12</b> in the first configuration <b>11</b> of device <b>10</b> will create a tension force in the radial direction which will be alleviated when the coil is released into the body vessel and will serve to accelerate ejection of the device from the delivery catheter <b>80</b>. Inconel also has an additional advantage of good radiopacity so that placement of devices incorporating it can be visualized.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Elgiloy is a cobalt-chromium-nickel alloy that exhibits high strength and low corrosion, making it suitable for inclusion in a medical device. Of course, any metal with suitable stiffness and biocompatibility, such as stainless steel, may be used for the outer coils <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the outer coils are instead made of a shape-memory alloy such as nitinol.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 1D</figref>, a single inner coil <b>14</b> is depicted. The inner coil <b>14</b> comprises a number of windings from the first proximal end <b>25</b> to the distal end. In one embodiment, the second winding lengths <b>33</b> between equivalent points on consecutive windings of the coil are equal along the entire length of the coil. The windings can extend from the proximal device end <b>20</b> to the distal device end. In some embodiments, some individual inner coils <b>14</b> can have a shorter length than the outer coils <b>12</b>. The inner coil <b>14</b> also has a second coil height <b>21</b>, which is defined as the diameter of the largest coil winding. In certain embodiments, the heights of each coil winding segment are all equal to one another along the length of the coil.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In contrast with the relatively stiff outer coils <b>12</b>, the inner coils <b>14</b> may in some embodiments be relatively soft, flexible, or pliable. In one embodiment, the inner coils <b>14</b> are made of platinum. Platinum has been used in numerous embolization coils and occlusion devices, such as Cook NESTER coils and platinum Cook TORNADO microcoils. Like platinum, palladium is another metal which is well suited for making inner coils <b>14</b>. Both platinum and palladium are soft, unreactive, and capable of conforming to the anatomy of a patient. In cases where the device <b>10</b> will be deployed to body vessels or body cavities of irregular shape, the flexibility of the inner coils <b>14</b> will ease stress on the device and hasten the deployment process. In other embodiments, the inner coils <b>14</b> can be made of other metals, or of nonmetals such as polymers having the appropriate properties for proper occlusion.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Referring again to <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>, the plurality of outer coils <b>12</b> are fixed at the first proximal ends <b>15</b> inside of an interior lumen or first interior portion of proximal cap <b>28</b> or first interior portion. Likewise, the plurality of inner coils <b>14</b> are fixed at their second proximal ends <b>25</b> inside of an interior lumen of proximal cap <b>28</b>. Likewise, the distal ends of the outer coils <b>12</b> and the inner coils <b>14</b> are fixed within a lumen of distal cap <b>38</b> or second interior portion. The ends of the coils can be fixed in any manner suitable to maintaining the integrity of the device during delivery and after deployment. For instance, the inner surface or lumen of a cap may have a post or loop which the ends of the coils can be wrapped around and secured. In another embodiment, the ends of the coils may be welded to the inner surface of the cap.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In another embodiment, the proximal or distal cap, or both, may be solid. In such a case, the coils would be secured to an outer surface of the caps rather than an inner surface. In another embodiment, some of the inner coils may not be long enough to contact both the proximal and the distal cap. In such a case, only one end of such coils would be attached to a cap portion of the occlusion device <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the device of <figref>FIG. 1A</figref> is depicted deployed in lumen <b>92</b> of a body vessel <b>90</b> rather than a catheter. The device as deployed is in its second configuration <b>81</b>, or deployed configuration. Having been transferred from a catheter of a smaller diameter to a body vessel <b>90</b> with a larger diameter, the device has expanded radially and the outer coils <b>12</b> have contracted as a result. Stated another way, the second device diameter <b>89</b> is greater than the first device diameter <b>19</b>, whereas the second device length <b>87</b> is smaller or less than the first device length <b>17</b>. The stiffness of the coils creates a lengthening and contracting phenomenon similar to a spring, where the contracted state is favored. Packing in the delivery apparatus causes lengthening and stretching of the outer coils <b>12</b> functioning similar to a spring, and release into a vessel lumen or cavity of a greater diameter causes a shortening of the distance <b>13</b> between windings of the coils and a degree of radial expansion.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Turning now to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, a third configuration <b>91</b> is depicted. In this configuration, the device is not constrained radially by either a body vessel or a catheter; rather, it is depicted in a state in which it is not being acted upon by outside forces. In this third configuration <b>91</b>, the outer coils <b>12</b> arc outward, away from the longitudinal axis <b>41</b> that runs through the device. The device <b>10</b> has a third device length <b>97</b>, which is shorter than device length <b>17</b> when the device is in its first, configuration <b>11</b> as depicted in <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In the third configuration <b>91</b>, a third device diameter dimension <b>99</b> is observed, which represents the maximum diameter of the device <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, this is the diameter of the central lumen plane which is defined by the circle drawn along a device circumference <b>50</b> using the device midpoint <b>40</b> as the center of the circle. The diameter of the device at any given point in such an embodiment will decrease from the device midpoint <b>40</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>41</b> either toward the proximal end <b>20</b> or the distal end <b>30</b>. In its unconstrained state, a device in third configuration <b>91</b> may have the shape of an oblate spheroid.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In certain embodiments, the occlusion device may optionally comprise thrombogenic material in order to encourage further occlusion. Thrombogenic fibers <b>96</b> are depicted on an outer coil <b>12</b> of the device. Suitable synthetic fibers include polyethylene terephthalate (DACRON), polyesters, polyamides (nylons), polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, and the like. Other synthetic polymers having a lesser degree of thrombogenicity include fluorocarbons (Teflon) and polyaramids (Kevlar). Natural fibers such as silk and cotton are also suitable materials. The fibers may be attached to a portion of the device in any acceptable way. As shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, individual fibrous elements <b>96</b> are dispersed about one of the outer coils <b>12</b> at various intervals, whereas elongated fibrous element <b>95</b> is wrapped, wound, or woven about another outer coil <b>12</b> across a greater length of the coil. The outer coiled elements may have at least one portion with thrombogenic fibers.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Thrombogenic fibers or coatings may be applied to some of the outer coils <b>12</b>, all of the outer coils <b>12</b>, or portions of the outer coils. Such fibers or coatings may also be applied to the inner coils <b>14</b> or portions thereof. Both outer coils and inner coils may be coated or have thrombogenic fibers attached, or any combination of the above. The thrombogenic material may be attached to the device by any suitable means, including tying, weaving, wrapping, or attaching by a silicone or other acceptable adhesive.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, another embodiment of the device is shown. The device of <figref>FIG. 4</figref> differs from the device of <figref>FIG. 1</figref> in that there is no cap at the distal end <b>30</b>. As a result, the distal ends of the outer coils <b>12</b> and the inner coils <b>14</b> are not enclosed.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> depicts the second configuration <b>81</b> of the device without a cap at distal end <b>30</b>. As with the two-capped device of <figref>FIGS. 1A and 2</figref>, the device expands radially when deployed due to the springlike nature of the resilient outer coils <b>12</b>. The softer inner coils <b>14</b> can be left unconstrained within the vessel lumen <b>92</b>, or can be fastened together prior to insertion in the delivery catheter. Optionally, the inner coils <b>14</b> can be manipulated manually by the interventionalist using a hook or snare that accompanies the device in the delivery assembly. The inner coils <b>14</b> in particular can take on a ârandomâ or âbunchedâ arrangement, which can provide a suitable configuration for occlusion of a vessel or cavity. The deployed configuration can have a less ordered configuration of inner coils <b>14</b> than the first configuration within the delivery apparatus.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is the third configuration <b>91</b> for the device with a free distal end <b>30</b>. When not constrained by a delivery apparatus or a body vessel, along with no restraint imposed by a cap at the distal end <b>30</b>, the device reverts to its state of lowest potential energy. In the embodiment depicted, this results in a spreading of the coils away from the longitudinal axis <b>41</b>. In some embodiments, the distances between the coil windings may increase as the individual coils relax. In some embodiments this can result in a substantially conical shape for the device in the third configuration <b>91</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">As with the two-cap embodiment of the device, a device having a single cap may also have some or all of its coils coated with a thrombogenic substance or have thrombogenic fibers attached thereto. In certain embodiments, the single-cap embodiment can be advantageous in situations where rapid deployment of the device are necessary, as the free distal end <b>30</b> of the device will provide nearly-instant contact with vessel walls when advanced out of the delivery apparatus and may additionally provide an additional force from the expansion of its free distal end in order to extricate the device from the delivery apparatus all the more quickly.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">
        <figref>FIGS. 7A-7C</figref> depict various embodiments of a cap <b>101</b> that can be used in accordance with embodiments of the device. In one embodiment, the cap <b>101</b> has a cap lumen <b>102</b> that forms a portion for the insertion of ends of the outer coils <b>12</b>, the inner coils <b>14</b>, or both. The cap has a top end <b>103</b> which, when attached to the proximal end <b>20</b> or distal end <b>30</b> of a device, constitutes the most proximal or most distal surface, respectively, of the device as a whole.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The cap also optionally comprises a positioning member <b>105</b>. In <figref>FIG. 7A</figref>, the positioning member is an engagement loop which defines a space <b>106</b> between the positioning member <b>105</b> and a portion of top end <b>103</b>. The space <b>106</b> is a place where a delivery apparatus having a snare or a hook for deployment can engage the device as it is delivered to the body vessel or body cavity it is to occlude. The highest point of positioning member <b>105</b> to the bottom portion of the cap defines a cap height <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Many variations on cap structure can be used in accordance with the principles of this device. In <figref>FIG. 7B</figref>, the positioning member <b>105</b> is a closed loop set apart from the top surface of the cap by spacer <b>107</b>. <figref>FIG. 7C</figref> shows another embodiment of a cap wherein the positioning member is a blunt-ended hook <b>108</b>. The cap structure can be modified in order to accommodate the particular tools involved in delivery of the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">One method of delivering the device includes introducing a delivery apparatus within the blood vessel <b>90</b> and providing the occlusion device <b>10</b> in its undeployed first configuration <b>11</b>. A two-sheath configuration can be used to deliver the device. Such a configuration might include an inner sheath containing a tool for manipulating the device such as a pusher member optionally terminating in a hook or a snare to engage the proximal end <b>20</b> of the occlusion device <b>10</b>. The device is also housed within the inner sheath, and the inner sheath is set within an outer sheath. The outer sheath extends at least to the distal end <b>30</b> of the occlusion device <b>10</b> to maintain the occlusion device <b>10</b> in the undeployed first configuration <b>11</b>. This minimizes radial expansion of the device prior to arrival at the site to be occluded.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">When the delivery system is properly positioned at a desired location within the body vessel or body cavity, the outer sheath can be withdrawn in a proximal direction to allow the distal end of the occlusion device <b>10</b> to move into the vessel lumen <b>92</b> and being to expand radially within the body vessel <b>90</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">At this stage, the interventionalist can readily monitor the positioning of the occlusion device <b>10</b> using the intrinsic radiopacity of the coils of the device or, if they are made of a non radiopaque material, a radiopaque tag that has been incorporated into the device <b>10</b>. If necessary, the device <b>10</b>, which has not been fully deployed, can be withdrawn back into the outer sheath of the delivery assembly to allow repositioning.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Once the distal end <b>30</b> of the occlusion device <b>10</b> has been properly positioned, the outer sheath can be withdrawn further to allow radial expansion and occlusion. In the case of a one-cap embodiment of the invention, engagement of the distal portion of the device <b>10</b> with the vessel or cavity wall helps to avoid migration of the occlusion device <b>10</b> during deployment. This also initiates occlusion of the vessel as the entire diameter of the vessel should at this point be engaged.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">After the device has been positioned appropriately, the inner sheath and the outer sheath are withdrawn so that the entirety of the occlusion device <b>10</b> is within the vessel lumen. A pusher member or other engagement device that can manipulate the device by cap <b>101</b> can be used if the removal of the sheaths is not sufficient to affect complete positioning and deployment of the device <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">During deployment, contrast injection can be used to verify the position of the occlusion device <b>10</b>. If adjustment is required, the device can be manipulated by engaging a cap member at positioning member <b>105</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">While the above method describes a single method of deployment, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other deployment methods are possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The embodiments of the present invention have many advantages. The occlusion device <b>10</b> provides a series of stiff outer coils <b>12</b> that help to maintain the overall shape of the device and also provide radial force to keep the device in place when deployed. The more pliant inner coils <b>14</b> provide a great amount of surface area for thrombi to collect. Moreover, any of the coils can be coated with a thrombogenic material or thrombogenic fibers to speed occlusion in the case of a blood vessel. If needed, the device can be made without a distal cap in order to provide nearly-instant contact with vessel walls during deployment and an extra force for thrusting the device out of the delivery catheter. Moreover, this combination of coils avoids an iterative process of adding coils until occlusion is achieved by providing a single-step deployment protocol.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">As a person skilled in the art will readily appreciate, the above description is meant as an illustration of the implementation of the principles of this invention. This description is not intended to limit the scope or application of this invention in that the invention is susceptible to modification variation and change, without departing from the spirit of this invention, as defined in the following claims.</p>
