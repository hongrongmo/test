    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">Methods and systems for purifying a crude aniline. The method can include contacting a crude aniline that can include aniline, water, and cyclohexanone with a cation exchange resin to produce a cyclohexanone-lean product that contains less cyclohexanone than the crude aniline. The cation exchange resin can be a solid, a semi-solid, or a combination thereof.</p>

      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Aromatic amines, including aniline, are precursors for the preparation of many industrial chemicals. The largest use of aniline is in the production of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), which can be reacted with polyols to produce polyurethane. Aniline can be produced by a catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene, as shown in Reaction 1.</p>

      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0006">The catalyst can include Raney nickel; palladium on charcoal or nickel; or cobalt, copper or nickel on kieselguhr. Reaction 1, however, can result in the formation of impurities. One such impurity is cyclohexanone, which is difficult to remove from aniline by physical methods. For example, aniline and cyclohexanone cannot be readily separated by distillation because of their similarity in boiling points.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0007">The crude aniline containing the cyclohexanone can be reacted under acidic conditions to form an imine compound, or Schiff's Base, namely cyclohexylidene aniline, as shown in Reaction 2.</p>

      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0008">The aniline can then be purified by removing the higher molecular weight cyclohexylidene aniline.

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0014">Methods and systems for purifying a crude aniline are provided. The method can include contacting a crude aniline that can include aniline, water, and cyclohexanone with a cation exchange resin to produce a cyclohexanone-lean product that contains less cyclohexanone than the crude aniline. The cation exchange resin can be a solid, a semi-solid, or a combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0015">It has been surprisingly and unexpectedly discovered that by using heterogeneous reaction conditions for Reaction 2, where a cationic resin catalyst or cationic exchange resin is used to provide an acidic environment, a concentration of cyclohexanone in an aniline feed or âcrude anilineâ can be significantly reduced by reacting the cyclohexanone with the aniline to produce cyclohexylidene aniline. The acidic nature of the cationic exchange resin can catalyze the reaction without consuming the cation. The cation exchange resin can reduce the concentration of cyclohexanone in the crude aniline by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 50%, at least 70%, or at least 90%. For example, the crude aniline can be contacted with the cationic exchange resin to produce a cyclohexanone-lean product or purified aniline product that has a concentration of cyclohexanone reduced by about 30%, about 40%, or about 50% to about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, or about 95% or more, as compared to the crude aniline prior to contact with the cationic exchange resin. In another example, the cation exchange resin can reduce the concentration of cyclohexanone in the crude aniline by about 10% to about 50%, about 20% to about 50%, about 30% to about 60%, about 40% to about 65%, about 50% to about 70%, about 50% to about 75%, about 60% to about 90%. In another example, the cation exchange resin can reduce the concentration of cyclohexanone by at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or 95% in a crude aniline that contains about 100 ppmw to about 15,000 ppmw of cyclohexanone.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0016">It has also been surprisingly and unexpectedly discovered that the cation exchange resin can reduce the concentration of cyclohexanone in the crude aniline by at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95% in a time period of less than 60 minutes, less than 45 minutes, less than 30 minutes, or less than 15 minutes. For example, the cation exchange resin can reduce the concentration of cyclohexanone in the crude aniline by at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95% in a time period of about 1 minute to about 15 minutes, about 5 minutes to about 20 minutes, about 15 minutes to about 30 minutes, about 25 minutes to about 40 minutes, about 35 minutes to about 50 minutes, or about 40 minutes to about 60 minutes.</p>

For example, the fill material can include, but is not limited to, structured materials, random packed materials, trays, or any combination thereof.

      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0072">A set of tests was conducted to determine the effect of the cation resins on Reaction 2. Two types of cation resins were tested, namely, a Type 13 (Ex. 1) and a Type 14 (Ex. 2) resin. The cation resins were used wet, same as shipping conditions, without prior drying. The Type 13 resin had an upper operating temperature of about 120Â° C. and the Type 14 resin had an upper operating temperature of about 150Â° C. The aniline used in the tests was reagent grade aniline that had a moisture content of less than 1,000 ppmw. About 50 mL of aniline was added to separate glass flasks and about 0.5 g of cation resin was added to each flask. The aniline/resin mixture was heated to reaction temperature and stirred on a shaker table. To each aniline/resin mixture, about 0.15 mL of reagent grade cyclohexanone was added to make up an aniline solution that contained about 3,000 ppmw of cyclohexanone. Samples were taken at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes and analyzed for cyclohexanone content by gas chromatography. One control example (C1) was also tested that did not contain any cation exchange resin. The test conditions and results are shown in Table 1 below.</p>

For example, after 60 minutes the concentration of cyclohexanone in Example 1 was reduced by about 58% and the concentration of cyclohexanone in Example 2 was reduced by about 63%. In contrast, the control example C1 contained about 2,995 ppmw cyclohexanone after 60 minutes.</p>

<claim-text>hydrogenating an aromatic nitro compound to produce a crude aniline comprising about 85 wt % to about 99 wt % of aniline, about 1 wt % to about 15 wt % of water, and about 100 ppmw to about 15,000 ppmw of cyclohexanone;</claim-text><claim-text>separating at least a portion of the water from the crude aniline to produce a dehydrated product comprising about 98 wt % or more of aniline, less than about 5,000 ppmw of water, and about 100 ppmw to about 5,000 ppmw of cyclohexanone;</claim-text><claim-text>reacting a portion of the cyclohexanone with a portion of the aniline in the dehydrated product to produce a cyclohexanone-reduced product comprising less cyclohexanone than the dehydrated product; and</claim-text><claim-text>contacting the cyclohexanone-reduced product at a temperature of about 50Â° C. to about 150Â° C. with a cation exchange resin to produce a cyclohexanone-lean product that comprises less cyclohexanone than the cyclohexanone-reduced product, wherein the cation exchange resin is solid, semi-solid, or a combination thereof.</claim-text></claim-text>
    </claim>
