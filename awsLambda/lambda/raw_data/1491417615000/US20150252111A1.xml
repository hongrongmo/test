      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Tolerance to specific antigens is the ultimate therapeutic goal in two major immunological fields, autoimmunity and transplantation rejection. Over the past several decades, the generation of a large array of immunosuppressive agents has increased the number of therapeutic tools available to address these two issues. The focus has now shifted to tackling the side effects of long-term immunosuppression. The final goal is to achieve T and B cell tolerance that is antigen specific without the need for long-term generalized immunosuppression.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">According to the mechanisms underlying peripheral T cell tolerance upto now, DCs (Dendritic Cells) have a key role in immune regulation (Steinman et al., 2003. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 21:685-711) and antigen presentation by immature and semimature DCs results in immune tolerance rather than effective T cell immunity because of the failure to provide sufficient co-stimulatory signals (Reis e Sousa, 2006. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 6: 476-483). These tolerogenic DCs are characterized by low-level expression of surface MHC molecules and several other co-stimulatory receptors and the production of low levels of Th1 cytokines, notably IL-12p70 (Morelli and Thomson, 2007. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 7: 610-621).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">ICAM-1 is a cell surface glycoprotein and a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily composed of five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains) and expresses at low level in various types of cells but the expression is greatly increased in the inflammatory region. ICAM-1 binds to LFA-1 (Leukocyte Function Associated Antigen-1) expressed on the surface of T cells, and functions as a costimulatory factor for antigen presenting cells thus medicating the interaction between antigen presenting cells such as DC and T cells (Transplantation. 1999, 67:729-736). Also the expression of ICAM-1 is increased at the inflammatory site of endothelial cells of blood vessels and is involved in the migration of leukocytes to the inflammatory site.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Thus several antibodies to ICAM-1 have been developed to regulate the inflammatory and immunological response. Among them is an IgG2a mAb R6.5 (BIRR-1, Enlimomab). It has been found that it inhibits the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells of the blood vessel thus reducing the extravasation of leukocytes into tissue and the damages to the inflammatory tissues (J Immunol. 1990, 144: 4604-4612). However, Enlimomab has been found to have side effects such as fever and leukocytopenia and not to able to reduce the rate of acute rejection or the risk of delayed onset of graft function after renal transplantation in a randomized multicenter study (Transplantation 1999, 67:729-736).</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">European patent application 0 459 577 discloses an antibody to ICAM-1 inhibiting the adhesion of rhinovirus to cellular receptors. U.S. Pat. No. 7,696,324 discloses a humanized antibody of what is disclosed in EP 0 459 577.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">ICAM-1 plays a key role in the defense to bacterial infection by host cells since its role in the migration of leukocytes through endothelial cells in the initiation of immunological response. Therefore there are needs to develop antibodies based on the immunological regulation via the interaction between T cells and antigen presenting cells without affecting the migration of leukocytes through endothelial cells of the blood vessel.</p>

      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">In one aspect, the present disclosure relates to an antibody and antigen-binding fragment thereof recognizing specifically ICAM-1 protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">ICAM-1 is a cell surface glycoprotein and a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily composed of five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains numbered 1 to 5 from N to C terminus and expressed at low level in various types of cells but the expression is greatly increased in the inflammatory region. ICAM-1 binds to LFA-1 (Leukocyte Function Associated Antigen-1) expressed on the surface of T cells, and functions as a costimulatory factor for antigen presenting cells thus medicating the interaction between antigen presenting cells such as DC and T cells (Transplantation. 1999, 67:729-736).</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">The ICAM-1 to which the present antibody specifically recognizes is from mammals, particularly human, non-human primate for example monkeys and chimpanzees. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the ICAM-1 are known in the related art. For example, for human, such sequences are known as GenBank Accession No.: NM 000201 and NP 000192 for nucleotide and amino acid sequences respectively. In one embodiment, the present antibody recognizes ICAM-1 from human and non-human primate.</p>

      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">A SCA fragment is an antibody fragment in which variable regions of heavy chain and light chain are connected via a linker such as polypeptide and may be prepared by treating antibody with appropriate enzyme or using recombinant DNA technology known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat No. 4,936,778 may be referred for preparing ScFv. Or the antibody produced by the present hybridoma cell may be prepared by treating the antibody with appropriate enzymes or using recombinant DNA technology for example by preparing a vector comprising nucleic acids encoding heavy and/or light chain of the antibody and expressing the vector in appropriate cells to prepare antibodies specifically recognizing ICAM-1.</p>

In the context of an antigen-antibody binding, âspecific bindingâ refers to a dissociation constant (Kd) which can be differentiated from a non-specific background binding and includes Kd of less than 1Ã10<sup>â5</sup>M or less than 1Ã10<sup>â6</sup>M or less than 1Ã10<sup>â7</sup>M. The specific binding may be detected or analyzed using the methods known in the art from example ELISA, immunoprecipitation, or coprecipitation and the like in which appropriate controls to differentiate non-specific from specific bindings are used. In one embodiment, Kd of the present antibody specifically binding to ICAM-1 is 2.78Ã10<sup>â8 </sup>M for a mouse antibody or 8.42Ã10<sup>â9 </sup>M for IgG4 chimeric antibody, which is a sufficiently high affinity so as to be used as a therapeutic antibody.</p>

Such multimers also include monomers of homogenous or heterogeneous origin. Multimers includes at least one antigen binding region and thus have an excellent binding affinity to antigens compared to the monomer. Ab multimers may also be used conveniently to prepare multifunctional or multivalent antibodies such as bifunctional or bivalent, trifunctional or trivalent, and tetrafunctional or tetravalent antibodies.</p>

      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0124">Human PBMCs were isolated from bloods from healthy donor using concentration gradient centrifuge under Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare, USA). ICAM-1/Fc proteins were prepared as below. First, mRNAs were extracted using the PBMCs isolated as above which were treated with plant origin haemagglutinin and cDNAs were synthesized by PCR using the following primers encoding NheI and EcoRI restriction site at each ends: Forward primer 5â²GCT AGC GCA ACC TCA GCC TCG CTATGGCTC-3â² (SEQ ID NO: 1); Reverse primer, 5â²-GAA TTC ATC TCA TAC CGG GGG GAG AGC AC-3â² (SEQ ID NO: 2).</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">To fuse human IgG Fc region, the amplified products were cloned into EcoRI and XhoI sites of a vector pSecTag (Invitrogen, USA). Then, the vector was transfected into HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) using calcium phosphate methods to express the cloned gene. Then ICAM-1/Fc proteins were isolated from the medium using protein G column.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0126">Then 100 Î¼g of the purified protein emulsified in complete Freund was administered intraperitoneally to a female Balb/c mouse (6Ë8 weeks, 17Ë25 g; KOATECH) twice with an interval of two weeks. After two weeks, the immunized mice were boosted with 100 Î¼g of ICAM-1/Fc proteins. Then 3 days after the last administration, the spleen was removed from the mouse to prepare the splenocytes.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0127">Monoclonal antibodies were produced by fusing the spleen cells of Balb/c immunized with human ICAM-1/Fc with SP2/0-Ag14 mouse myeloma cells (ATCC CRL-1581) resistant to 9-azaguanine. Cell fusion was performed basically following the method described in Koeler and Milstein (Koeler &amp; Milstein Nature, 1975, 256, 495-497). Briefly 10<sup>8 </sup>spleen cells were fused with 10<sup>7 </sup>myeloma cells using 50% polyethylene glycol 4000 (Roche, USA). The cells were then washed once PBS and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 Î¼M hypoxanthine, 0.44 Î¼M aminopterin and 16 Î¼M thymidine (HAT media, Sigma). The cells were seeded onto each well of four 96-well plates and incubated at 37Â° C. in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator for two weeks and allowed to form colonies.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0128">Then when colonies were formed after two weeks, the supernatants were screened for the expression of antibodies using human ICAM-1-transfected HEK 293T cells. Wild-type HEK293T cells were used as a negative control. The harvested media were incubated with HEK 293T cells for 30 min at 4Â° C., which were then washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween. Then the cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody for 30 min at 4Â° C. and then colonies stained with the antibody compared to the negative control were selected and subcloned 0.5 cell per well by limited dilution to produce a stable hybridoma clone producing the monoclonal antibody. Among the hybridomas produced, hybridomas producing an antibody binding to ICAM-1 from monkey and human were obtained and deposited as KCLRF-BP-00264 on May 4, 2011 with KCLRF (Korean Cell Line Research Foundation).</p>

      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0129">To identify the ICAM1 domain for MD-3 antibody binding, human and mouse ICAM1 genes were obtained from N. Hogg (Cancer Research UK, London, England, UK). The monkey ICAM-1 gene was cloned based on the published sequence (available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. NM<sub>â</sub>001047135.1). The chimeric constructs as described in <figref>FIG. 1A</figref> were cloned according to a previously described protocol (Berendt et al., 1992. Cell. 68:71-81). HEK 293T cells were then transfected with plasmid DNAs constructed and the cells were stained with primary antibody at 4Â° C. for 30 min. After washing in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and staining with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse Ig antibody at 4Â° C. for 30 min, the live cells, gated as the propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich)-negative population, were analyzed using FACSCalibur (BD) equipped with CellQuest Pro software (BD).</p>

      <heading id="h-00018-en" level="1">Adhesion Assay of Anti-Human ICAM-1 Monoclonal Antibody to Cells</heading>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0131">The effect of MD-3 on the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells was examined. ICAM-1 mediates leukocyte-leukocyte and leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions by binding to LFA-1 (lymphocyte function associated antigen 1) and Mac-1. Therefore, antibodies to ICAM-1 or LFA-1 are able to prevent the adhesion of leukocyte to endothelial cells and T cell activation. HUVECs (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell) were prepared and cultured on hydrated collagen gels (for monocyte adhesion) or directly on fibronectin-coated 96-well plates (for neutrophil adhesion), as described previously (Muller et al., 1989. J. Exp. Med. 170:399-414). As controls, anti CD-18 antibody (IB4 monoclonal antibody) (Wright et al., 1983. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 80:5699-5703) and conventional ICAM-antibody (R6-5-D6) (Smith et al., 1988. J. Clin. Invest. 82:1746-1756; Berendt et al., 1992. Cell. 68:71-81) were used.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0132">For neutrophil adhesion, HUVEC monolayers were activated by culturing them in 10 ng/ml TNF overnight. HUVECs were not activated for monocyte adhesion assays. Under these conditions, when freshly isolated PBMCs are added, lymphocytes do not stick to the endothelial cells, but monocytes do (Muller and Weigl, 1992. J. Exp. Med. 176:819-828). Neutrophils (Lou et al., 2007. J. Immunol. 178:1136-1143) and PBMCs (Muller and Weigl, 1992. J. Exp. Med. 176:819-828) were isolated as described previously and subjected to adhesion assays using the standard approaches (Muller and Weigl, 1992; Lou et al., 2007; Muller and Luscinskas, 2008 Methods Enzymol. 443:155-176). In brief, freshly isolated polymorphonuclear neutrophils or PBMCs were resuspended to 1Ã10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml or 2Ã10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml, respectively, mixed gently with monoclonal antibodies as shown in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref> at a final concentration of 20 Î¼g/ml, and added to the endothelial monolayers for 25 min at 37Â° C. Monolayers were washed free of nonadherent cells, fixed, and stained with Wright-Giemsa stain for microscopic evaluation. Six replicates of each variable were performed for each experiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0133">Results are shown in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref> in which PBMCs or neutrophils were incubated with human umbilical vein endothelial monolayers in the absence (negative control [NC]) or presence of monoclonal antibodies specific for CD18 (IB4), ICAM-1 (R6.5) or MD-3. Data are expressed as the mean adhesion relative to controlÂ±SE of three experiments (except IB4 in the monocyte adhesion assay, where n=2), with six replicates per experiment. n.s., not significant; *, P&lt;0.05; ***, P&lt;0.001. As shown previously, ICAM-1 domain 2 antibody R6.5-D6 and anti-CD18 (IB4) antibody was fond to inhibit the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells. However, MD-3 was not found to inhibit the adhesion of both monocytes and neutrophils to endothelial cells. This indicates that MD-3 does not affect the transendothelial migration of immune cells.</p>

      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0134">Humanized mice were generated according to a previously described protocol (Ito et al., 2002. Blood 100:3175-82). In brief, NOG mice were exposed to 200 rad of total body irradiation from a 137Cs source. The next day, each recipient mouse received 1-2Ã10<sup>5 </sup>CD34+ cells that were purified from human cord blood cells using magnetic sorting (Miltenyi Biotec). Repopulation of total human hematopoietic cells and T cells in peripheral blood was monitored weekly by flow cytometry after staining with anti-human MHC class I and CD3 antibodies. At the time of sacrifice, spleens were collected, and single cells were resuspended in flow cytometry buffer (PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Na azide). After staining with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for 30 min at 4Â° C., the live cells were analyzed using a flow cytometer. The following fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD or Dinona: anti-human MHC class I (YG13), CD3 (UCHT1), CD4 (RPA-T4), CD8 (DN17), CD11c (B-ly6), CD14 (MEM-18), CD15 (HI98), CD19 (HIB19), CD80 (L307.4), C86 (FUN-1), and CD123 (9F5).\</p>

      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0136">A total pancreatectomy was performed without warm ischemia time, and islet isolation was performed using the modified Ricordi method, as previously described (Jin et al., 2010. Cell Transplant. 19:299-311). In brief, Liberase MTF C/T (Roche) or Clzyme collagenase MA and CIzyme BP protease (VitaCyte) were dissolved in endotoxin-free water and diluted to a total volume of 1 ml/g of pancreas weight with a preservation solution at 4Â° C. and intraductally administered. The preservation solution was composed of Na hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium chloride, magnesium sulfate, Na phosphate, d-mannitol, and NaCl. During digestion, the pancreas, which was inflated with collagenase, was incubated without shaking for 12-15 min at 35-37Â° C. until the pancreas tissue was loosened. This was followed by manual shaking with serial sampling. After free islets were observed in the serial sample, digestion was stopped by cooling to 4Â° C. and exposing the islets to 10% porcine serum. Islets were purified with a continuous OptiPrepâ¢ density gradient (Axis-Shield) and a Cobe 2991 cell separator (Gambro BCT Inc.).

Humanized mice that did not receive STZ before porcine islet transplantation were also examined to exclude any possible effect of STZ on MD-3 antibody function and generalized immune response (<figref>FIG. 3B</figref>, bottom). Three days after the administration, blood glucose and serum porcine C-peptide levels were monitored weekly (<figref>FIG. 3B</figref>), and mice were sacrificed 42 days after the initial transplantation (<figref>FIG. 3</figref> C). <figref>FIG. 3A</figref> depicts the experimental protocol with time.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0148">Results are shown in <figref>FIG. 3B to 3D</figref>. <figref>FIG. 3B</figref> shows fasting blood glucose (open circles; right y axis) and porcine C-peptide (closed squares; left y axis) levels which were monitored weekly. During the monitoring period, in the groups treated with MD-3, the blood glucose was maintained at the normal level as well as the amount of C-peptide was detected at the normal level compared to the control. These data indicate the normal secretion of insulin from the transplanted islet. In <figref>FIG. 3C</figref>, functional survival of islet xenografts was plotted over time based on serum level of porcine C-peptide, The dotted line indicates the day when a portion of the mice were sacrificed for ELISPOT and histopathological analyses. Median graft survival in the control group was 24.5 d. In contrast, animals treated with MD-3 showed no evidence of graft rejection up to the time of their sacrifice. In <figref>FIG. 3D</figref>, serial kidney sections of a representative mouse in the control or MD-3-treated groups were stained with H&amp;E or antibodies specific for insulin, human CD3, or human CD68. In the control group, insulin-positive porcine islet cells were completely destroyed and replaced by inflammatory infiltrates, in which CD3+ T cells and either CD68+ macrophages were the predominant cellular components. In contrast, in the MD-3-treated group, large nests of insulin-positive porcine islet cells were clearly seen in the subcapsular area of the kidney with negligible infiltration of mononuclear cells in the peri-islet area (<figref>FIG. 3D</figref>, bottom)</p>

      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0149">As shown in EXAMPLE 2-9-1, MD-3 treatment resulted in the prolonged survival of xenografts in humanized mice. Thus to confirm that the lack of an immune response was a result of antigen-specific or generalized immunosuppression, two third-party stimulating antigens: a cellular alloantigen and soluble KLH was used for stimulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0150">Results are shown in <figref>FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. In <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>, recipient mice were challenged with KLH at 4 weeks after transplant. Splenocytes were isolated at 6 weeks after transplant and tested for recall IL-2 and IFN-gamma responses against donor islets, human allogeneic blood mononuclear cells (MLR), and KLH by ELISPOT assay. In <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, Summarized data from 4-11 mice are presented as total numbers of cytokine-producing cells per 3Ã10<sup>5 </sup>splenocytes. As a negative control (NC) for anti-islet response, splenocytes from humanized mice that did not undergo transplantation (ungrafted) were stimulated with porcine islets. In contrast, splenocytes from engrafted mice cultured in the absence of stimulating antigen (responder only) were used as a negative control for MLR and anti-KLH responses. Horizontal bars represent mean values. Ab represents antibody.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0151">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, when total splenocytes from control mice were stimulated with porcine islets, significant number of IL-2- and IFN-gamma-secreting T cells were detected (<figref>FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, left). In contrast, IL-2- and IFN-gamma-secreting T cells were almost completely absent from MD-3-treated mice, indicating the complete suppression of T cell responses to xeno-antigens. In contrast, the activation of T cells in response to human alloantigens, as assessed by mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), was comparable with that of controls (<figref>FIGS. 4A</figref> and B, middle). These data suggest that the unresponsiveness of the T cells does not reflect generalized immunosuppression, but rather the induction of T cell tolerance specific for porcine islet antigens</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0152">This induction of antigen-specific T cell tolerance was further indicated by in vivo challenge with an unrelated soluble antigen, KLH. At day 28 after transplantation, at which time MD-3 had been cleared completely, mice were immunized with soluble KLH antigen. Two weeks later, splenocytes were isolated and restimulated with the same antigen in an ex vivo system, and the numbers of KLH-specific T cells were evaluated in an ELISPOT assay. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> (right), there was a clear anti-KLH response in MD-3-treated mice in terms of the numbers of cells producing IFN-gamma and IL-2.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0153">In summary, these data again suggest that a normal immune response to KLH occurred in humanized mice that had been tolerized against diverse antigens from grafted porcine islets, indicating that the response was antigen specific.</p>

After removing the unconjugated saporin by protein G affinity chromatography, the anti-CD11c-saporin complexes were eluted with ImmunoPure elution buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and dialyzed against PBS.

      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0156">To investigate the effect of MD-3 on modulating the maturation status of human monocyte derived DCs, differentiation from monocytes to DCs was induced as described in EXAMPLE 3-1. Human CD14+ monocytes, isolated as precursors of monocyte derived DCs, were incubated for 6 d with GM-CSF and IL-4, in the presence of MD-3 or a control antibody, to induce their differentiation into immature DCs. Subsequently, immature DCs were treated with the Toll-like receptor agonist, LPS (maturation signal), for 1 day and then analyzed for cytokine production and surface expression of molecules linked to antigen presentation</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0157">Results are shown in <figref>FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. In <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>, expression levels of MHC class I and II, CD80, CD86, and CD40 on their surface were compared by flow cytometry. Cumulative data showing mean fluorescent intensity (MFI)Â±SE of MHC class I and II, CD80, CD86, and CD40 were obtained from four independent experiments. <figref>FIG. 5B</figref> shows representative cytokine levels in the culture supernatants of immature and LPS-treated monocyte-derived DCs in the presence of MD-3 or control antibody. Results are the meanÂ±SE of triplicate cultures, and data are representative of three independent experiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0158">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, treatment of monocytes with MD-3 from the beginning of culture resulted in the arrest of DC maturation in a semimature state. This differentiation state was confirmed by the expression of surface molecules, such as MHC classes I &amp; II, CD80, CD86, and CD40, at levels between those of immature and mature DCs (<figref>FIG. 5A</figref>). Furthermore, the production of cytokines, notably IL-12p70, IFN-gamma, IL-6, and TNF, was significantly lower in MD-3-treated cells than in those treated with the control antibody (<figref>FIG. 5B</figref>). The phenotype and function of DCs treated with MD-3 during their maturation were consistent with the features of semimature or tolerogenic DCs. Thus, these in vitro results suggest that MD-3 alone can arrest DC maturation in a semimature state.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0159">Next, to analyze the effect of MD-3 on DC maturation status in vivo, MD-3 and control antibodies were injected into humanized mice three times at 3-d intervals and followed by treatment with LPS. In <figref>FIG. 5C</figref>, at 24 h after LPS treatment, splenocytes were stained with HLA-ABC, CD11c, CD80, and CD86 antibodies. Representative dot plots of CD80 and CD86 expression on gated CD11c+ DCs are shown at the upper panel. Numbers indicate the percentage of cells in each quadrant. Cumulative data (n=3) showing mean fluorescent intensity were obtained from three independent experiments (lower left). The percentages of CD11c+ cells among HLA-ABC+ cells in spleens were also calculated (lower right). Error bars indicate SE. As shown in <figref>FIG. 5C</figref>, the expression of both surface molecules CD80 and CD86 was reduced in DCs from MD-3-treated mice versus the control group. These in vivo results, together with the aforementioned in vitro data, suggest that this form of maturation arrest can be achieved through in vivo treatment with MD-3 alone.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0160">Further since ICAM-1 is expressed on vascular endothelial cells, as well as activated T and B cells, changes in the surface expression of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules and the production of inflammatory cytokines in HUVECs and activated T cells and (b) antibody production in activated B cells were determined, when treated with MD-3 antibody. In HUVECs, no differences in surface expression and cytokine production of control and MD-3-treated groups (not depicted) were found.</p>

      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0161">To confirm that DCs play a key role in the induction of antigen-specific tolerance in vivo, saporin-conjugated anti-CD11c immunotoxin (IT) prepared as in EXAMPLE 3-2 was administered into humanized mice to establish a DC-depleted mouse model, which were then used for the experiment. Experimental scheme is depicted in <figref>FIG. 6A</figref>. Humanized mice received anti-CD11c IT (alpha-CD11c; 5 Î¼g/mouse) or PBS every other day from 3 d before porcine islet transplantation up to the fifth day after transplant (D+5). These mice were then immunized with KLH on the 12th day after transplant (D+12).</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0162">Results are shown in <figref>FIG. 6A to 6D</figref>. <figref>FIG. 6B</figref> is a result from flow cytometric analysis on the indicated days after islet transplantation to assess depletion of CD11c+ DCs in the spleen of humanized mice. Intraperitoneal injection of anti-CD11c IT nearly completely ablated DCs in humanized mice up to 10 d after islet graft. Serum MD-3 levels were measured two times per week, and MD-3 was not detected at 7 d after transplantation.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0163">At 12 d after transplantation, both groups of humanized mice were immunized with a mixture of alum and KLH. Splenocytes were isolated 14 d after KLH immunization and tested for recall IL-2 and IFN-gamma responses via ELISPOT assay against donor islets and KLH. Results are shown in <figref>FIG. 6C</figref>. The data from individual mice are presented as total numbers of cytokine producing cells per 3Ã10<sup>5 </sup>splenocytes or normalized anti-islet response (Islet/KLH) by dividing the anti-islet spot number by the anti-KLH spot number in each mouse. Horizontal bars represent mean values. As shown in <figref>FIG. 6C</figref>, 26 days after transplantation, numbers of IL-2- and IFN-gamma secreting T cells after rechallenge of porcine islet cells ex vivo differed significantly between control and DC-ablated mice. Ablation of CD11c+ DCs at the time of xenoantigen challenge resulted in severe impairment of T cell tolerance whereas mice treated with MD-3 alone mounted a T cell tolerance to xenoantigen challenge (<figref>FIG. 6C</figref>, left).</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0164">Next, to confirm that the T cell response that had returned against islet antigens was caused by the recovery of a normal immune response, which had been lost via the ablation of DCs, T cell responses to KLH in the control (PBS treated) and experimental group (IT treated) were examined As shown in <figref>FIG. 6C</figref> (middle), both groups exhibited clear T cell responses to KLH. However, in these experiments, numbers of KLH-responding T cells were reduced in anti-CD11c IT-treated mice, probably because of actual decreases in the numbers of DCs present in their spleens (<figref>FIG. 6D</figref>), suggesting that there may still have been a low level of toxicity. To normalize the anti-islet immune response based on the individual immune status of the mouse, the number of islet-responding T cells was divided by the number of spots responding to KLH stimuli in each mouse and expressed the relative value as a percentage. As shown in <figref>FIG. 6C</figref> (right), the data obtained demonstrated a clear difference in the T cell response to islet antigens between the two groups. These results indicate that the induction of antigen-specific T cell tolerance depends primarily on DCs.</p>

      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0165">Although humanized mice are powerful tools for exploring the functions of T and B cells and DCs, there are certain limitations when extrapolating humanized mouse data to humans. This includes the lack of granulocytic series, NK cells, and other as of yet unidentified factors (Shultz et al., 2007. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 7:118-130). Therefore, to test whether data from the humanized mouse system could be reproduced in a nonhuman primate model, experiments using <i>Rhesus macaques </i>were performed.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0166">MD-3 was found to bind to domain 2 of <i>Rhesus </i>ICAM-1 as shown in <figref>FIG. 7A</figref>.

As the negative control (dotted line), the cells were stained with only FITC-conjugated secondary antibody.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0167">Then as described in EXAMPLE 2-4 and 2-5, adult porcine islets (50,000 IEQs/kg) were intraportally transplanted into three <i>Rhesus </i>monkeys (R043, R042, and R038) that pretreated with MD-3 antibody.</p>

PBMCs were isolated on the indicated days after transplantation, and the frequency of T cells secreting IL-2 or IFN-gamma in response to donor islets was determined by ELISPOT assay. Results are presented as numbers of cytokine producing cells per 2.5Ã10<sup>5 </sup>PBMCs in each triplicate culture. MD-3 monotherapy failed to achieve graft survival for &gt;9 d, whereas ELISPOT analysis of PBMCs isolated from three recipient monkeys revealed near-complete suppression of IFN-gamma and IL-2 responses to donor pig islet antigen from day 7-47 (<figref>FIG. 7B</figref>). This clearly indicates that the induction of T cell tolerance to porcine islets was achieved, while immune reactions which is not dependent on T cell is involved in graft rejection. <figref>FIG. 7C</figref> in which anti-Gal IgG levels were measured at the indicated time before and after porcine islet transplantation via ELISA shows that anti-Gal (galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose) which is a typical T cell independent antibody was increased in <i>Rhesus </i>serum which received MD-3 antibody alone before the porcine islet transplantation.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0169">Long-term graft survival was finally achieved with a combination treatment of low-dose rapamycin (trough level 6-12 Î¼g/ml) and chimeric anti-CD154 blocking antibody (5C8; National Institutes of Health), as well as MD-3. This combined therapy of rapamycin and chimeric anti-CD154 antibody were known to regulate NK and NK-mediated innate B cell activation, which has been reported to be related to T-independent antigens, such as galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (Gal) and non-Gal sugar antigens (Li et al., 2007.

      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0181">To test whether MD-3 chimeric antibody as prepared in EXAMPLE 5-1 has a therapeutic efficacy similar to that of original mouse MD-3 antibody, the following xenograft experiments were performed as in EXAMPLE 4 except that chimeric MD-3 was used.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0182">Specifically as shown in <figref>FIG. 10A</figref>, for an induction therapy, 8 mg/kg MD-3 chimeric antibody was administered to diabetic <i>Rhesus macaque </i>receiving porcine islet transplantation on postoperative days (PODs) â9, â6, and â3. Anti-CD154 mAb (20 mg/kg) were given on PODs â10, â7, â4, 0, 3, 10, and then every 7 to 14 days up to POD 90. And for a maintenance therapy, daily sirolimus was given during the follow-up period (<figref>FIG. 10A</figref>). The <i>Rhesus macaque </i>that received the combined therapy and porcine islet graft has been remained euglycemic and insulin independent for more than 3 months (<figref>FIGS. 10B and 10C</figref>). C-peptide production and intravenous glucose tolerance testing verified that xenograft was functioning (<figref>FIGS. 10B and 10D</figref>). This result shows that MD-3 chimeric antibody used in combination with anti-CD154 and sirolimus is able to significantly prolog the survival of porcine islet grafts.</p>

      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0183">To test whether MD-3 chimeric antibody as prepared in EXAMPLE 5-1 has a therapeutic efficacy similar to that of original mouse MD-3 antibody, the following allograft experiments were performed as in EXAMPLE 4 except that chimeric MD-3 was used and allogenic islets were used and anti-CD154 was not administered.

      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0184">Specifically as shown in <figref>FIG. 11A</figref>, for an induction therapy, 8 mg/kg MD-3 chimeric antibody was administered to diabetic <i>Rhesus macaque </i>receiving allogenic islet transplantation on postoperative days (PODs) â6, and â3.
