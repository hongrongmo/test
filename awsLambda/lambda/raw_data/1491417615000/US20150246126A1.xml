      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention is directed to the unexpected discovery that the antitubercular activity of <sup>13</sup>C-acyl isoniazid (hINH) and related compounds as disclosed herein is increased substantially by the combined use of the drug, and a static magnetic field (e.g., about 50-300 gauss, 5-300 mT, preferably about 140 gauss, 0.14 mT). Combined use of magnetic field and hINH gave a substantially better in vitro killing than just hINH alone in <i>M tuberculosis </i>and an isoniazid resistant strain (KatG S315T mutant). Combined hINH and static magnetic field may find clinical use in tuberculosis (including drug resistant such as isoniazid resistant and multiple drug resistant tuberculosis) treatment in many ways, including through decreasing treatment times in isoniazid sensitive TB (more rapid recovery/cure), or in allowing treatment of drug resistant (e.g. isoniazid or ethionamide resistant) strains and/or multiple resistant strains of tuberculosis.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">RELATED APPLICATIONS AND GOVERNMENT SUPPORT</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/698,070, filed Sep. 7, 2012, and entitled âMagnetodynamic Activation of <sup>13</sup>C-acyl Isoniazidâ, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Isoniazid (INH) is a pro-drug that is activated by catalase peroxidase (KatG) of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </i>(Mtb) to produce isonicotinyol (INacyl) radicals that react with NAD to produce mycolate synthesis inhibitors.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Recently, it has been shown that isoniazid specifically substituted in the acyl position with <sup>13</sup>C greatly increase isoniazid activity, through enhanced formation of INH-NAD and NADP adducts after its activation by the bacterial enzyme KatG, with these adducts being the species that are highly toxic to mycobacteria. It is believed that this is due to isotope effects on several steps of the pathway, although effects in the reversibility of acyl radical addition to the NAD, perhaps play the major role. It has been shown that another major TB drug, ethionamide (and its related compound prothionamide), undergoes almost identical activation and adduct formation chemistries (Wang, et al. <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>204; 73-8 (2007)).</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">We found that INacyl radicals also decompose to release CO, and so lose the ability to produce INacyl-NAD adducts. Since CO induces dormancy in Mtb, we hypothesized that reducing this decarbonylation by selective <sup>13</sup>C substitution (to produce heavy isoniazid, hINH) would increase activity of the resultant drug by maximizing INacyl-NAD formation, and minimizing dormancy induction by CO. Here, we describe how this <sup>13</sup>C magnetic isotope effect (MIE) can produce more effective drugs in combination with static magnetic fields greater than the Earth magnetic field.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating a subject suffering from, or at risk of developing, a <i>Mycobacterium </i>infection by:</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0000">(a) administering to the subject a therapeutically-effective amount of isotopically labeled isoniazid and/or ethionamide, or an analog, derivative or prodrug thereof; and <br /> (b) exposing the subject to a magnetic field. </p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0007">In a preferred embodiment, the exposure of the subject to the magnetic field occurs concurrently with the administration of the therapeutically-effective amount of isotopically labeled isoniazid and/or ethionamide, or an analog, derivative or prodrug thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0008">The magnetic field which can be used in the methods of treatment of the invention ranges from about 10 to about 1,000 Gauss, more often about 50-250 Gauss, even more often about 100-200 Gauss, still more often about 140-160 Gauss, and most often has a value of around 150 Gauss. <figref>FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the magnetic field strength effect. It is believed that the magnetic field effect begins at around 50 gauss, reaches a maximize value at around 140 G, and begins to taper in the range of about 600-1,000 G.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0009">The enhanced therapeutic magnetic field effect described herein is maximized when the active ingredient preferably is:</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0000">(a) an isoniazid compound whose acyl group contains <sup>13</sup>C and/or <sup>17</sup>O, e.g.:</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0030">The following terms shall be used to describe the present invention. In instances where a term is not specifically defined herein, the term shall be accorded its meaning, within context, as understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0031">The term âcompoundâ shall mean any specific compound which is disclosed within this specification and typically means an isotopically labeled compound. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts (generally, pyridinium salts) are also compounds for use in the present invention. The term compound, as it relates to the present invention, also refers to isotopically labeled isoniazid, as well as compounds/derivatives of ethionamide, such as propionamide. +</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0032">The term âeffectiveâ when used in context, shall mean any amount of a compound or component which is used to produce an intended result within the context of its use. In the case of compounds according to the present invention, the term effective generally refers to a therapeutically effective amount of compound which will inhibit the growth (bacteriastatic) and/or produce a die-off (bacteriocidal) of <i>Mycobacterium</i>. This term is distinguishable from a diagnostic effective amount of isoniazid and/or ethionamide which may be used short term (for example, a few hours) to diagnose the presence of a tuberculosis infection in a patient at risk. Agents useful in treating tuberculosis infections are treated with an amount and for a duration effective in treating (i.e., in eliminating or at least stabilizing) the tuberculosis infection in the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0033">In the present invention, isotopically labeled isoniazid, ethionamide and/or propionamide (preferably, isoniazid) administered to a patient exposed to a magnetic field is often combined in therapeutically effective amounts with at least one and preferably more than one additional anti-tuberculosis agent selected from the group consisting of aminosalicyclic acid/aminosalicylate sodium, capreomycin sulfate, clofazimine, cycloserine, ethambutol hydrochloride, kanamycin sulfate, pyrazinamide, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine, streptomycin sulfate and mixtures thereof, all in therapeutically effective amounts, Therapeutically effective amounts of these agents generally range from as little as 1 mg/kg per day up to 50 mg/kg per day (100 mg up to several mg per day). Isoniazid and ethionamide are usually administered to a patient in therapeutically effective amounts ranging from about 5 mg/kg per day to about 20 mg/kg per day up to about 300-500 mg. In certain aspects therapeutic compounds may be administered daily, several times a week (e.g. 5 times a week) or once or twice weekly. Therapy generally continues for at least several weeks to 2 months and up to a year or more depending upon the severity of the infection and the response of the patient to therapeutic intervention.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0034">A typical oral dose of isoniazid and/or ethionamide is at least about 25 mg and is preferably at least about 50 mg. An oral dosage form of at least 75 mg of isoniazid or ethionamide or 100 mg may be given up to 3 to 4 times daily (QID).</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0035">In certain preferred aspects, therapy may have a minimum duration of 6 months (26 weeks), and consist of an initial intensive phase (2 months) and a continuation phase (usually either 4 or 7 months).</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0036">Isotopically labeled isoniazid and/or ethionamide may be combined with effective amounts of pyridoxine (Hexa-betalin), 10-50 mg/kg per day or more, in order to reduce the side effects of isoniazid/ethionamide therapy.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0037">In a preferred method of treating previously untreated patients infected with tuberculosis, a combination of isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol is utilized in therapeutically effective amounts to treat the patient. In this aspect of the invention, isoniazid is generally used at a concentration of about 5-10 mg/kg per day up to about 300 mg (or more, depending of the weight of the patient) per day. Rifampin is used at a concentration ranging from about 10 to 20 mg/kg per day up to about 600 mg per day. Pyrazinamide is used at a concentration ranging from about 15 to 30 mg/kg per day up to about 2 grams. Ethambutol is used at a concentration ranging from about 10 to 25 mg/kg per day up to about 1 gram.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0038">In other embodiments, a combination of ethionamide and gatifloxacin in therapeutically effective amounts with or without pyrazinamide may be used to treat tuberculosis. In this aspect of the invention, ethionamide in therapeutically effective amounts (about 5-25 mg/kg per day) and gatifloxacin (15-100 mg/kg per day) are used in amounts generally ranging from about several hundred mg per day or more up to several grams per day.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0039">The following table represents a series of recommended therapeutic approaches to tuberculsosis therapy. All of the therapies indicated in Table 1A include the use of isoniazid. The present isotopically labeled isoniazid compound may be substituted for indicated isoniazid. These are recommended therapies. The approach to tuberculosis therapy may be varied to provide effective approaches. Ethionamide may be substituted for isoniazid at slightly higher dosages. It is noted that in each of the therapies described hereinbelow, either at administration of the isotopically labeled isoniazid or other active compound, or at administration or during periods of therapy, a magnetic field as otherwise described herein is applied to the patient undergoing therapy to enhance delivery of the active agent to the site of infection in a target tissue.</p>

      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0040">The term âisotopically labeledâ shall mean isotopically labeled with carbon-13, nitrogen-15, sulfur-33, sulfur-34, oxygen-17, oxygen-18 at positions on the compound (exocyclic positions), preferably positions which are involved in reactions which produce toxic adducts to <i>Mycobacterium</i>. Each of these isotopes exhibits paramagnetism which responds to a magnetic field pursuant to the present invention. The magnetic field can be positioned on or near the patient in order to facilitate the concentration of isotopically labeled agent in a particular tissue or at a site to enhance biological activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0041">The term âmagnetâ is used to describe a material that is surrounded by a magnetic field which is natural or induced (e.g. electrically induced) such that the material will attract a paramagnetic material or ferromagnetic material, in the present invention, isotopically labeled compound(s). Magnets for use in the present invention may be permanent or electrically induced (electromagnets). Preferred magnets often are permanent magnets called neodymium magnets (neo magnets). They are a type of rare earth magnets made from an alloy of neodymium, iron and boron. They are currently considered the strongest permanent magnet. The term magnet also refers to electrically induced magnets or electromagnets which can be used to generate electric fields. An electromagnet produces a magnetic field based upon the flow of electric current in proximity to and through the material to be magnetized. An electromagnet may be advantageously used in the present invention and can have the magnetic field adjusted according to the amount of current flowing. The disadvantage of the electromagnet is the requirement for a permanent source of current to produce the electromagnetic field, resulting in logistical problems associated with therapy, particularly in ambulatory patients. Preferred magnets according to the present invention have a magnetic field greater than the Earths magnetic field ranging from about 10 to about 1000 Gauss or more, often about 50-250 Gauss, even more often about 100-200 Gauss, still more often about 140-160 Gauss, and most often has a value of around 150 Gauss. <figref>FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the magnetic field strength effect. It is believed that the magnetic field effect begins at around 50 gauss, reaches a maximize value at around 140 G, and begins to taper in the range of about 600-1,000 G. In certain instances, magnetic fields of significantly higher strength may be used (from about 0.1 to about 0.7 Tesla units or about 1,000 to about 7,000 Gauss or moreâup to about 1.5 Tesla or 15,000 Gauss depending on the infection, its difficulty in treating and the tissue and location in the tissue in which the infection is found), for example, in instances where administration into the lungs at a particular site is desired or in particularly difficult to treat illness (e.g. multiple drug resistant tuberculosis).</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0042">The unit for measuring the magnetic field forces for certain biomedical applications is the Tesla unit (1 Tesla unit corresponds to 10,000 Gauss). Gauss units are used in the CGS system whereas Tesla is applied in the SI system.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0043">The term â<i>Mycobacterium</i>â, is used to describe a genus of Actinobacteria, given its own family, the Mycobacteriaceae. The genus includes pathogens known to cause serious diseases in mammals, including tuberculosis and leprosy. The Latin prefix âmycoâ means both fungus and wax; its use here relates to the âwaxyâ compounds in the cell wall. Mycobacteria are aerobic and non-motile bacteria (except for the species <i>Mycobacterium </i>marinum which has been shown to be motile within macrophages) that are characteristically acid-alcohol fast. Mycobacteria do not contain endospores or capsules, and are usually considered Gram-positive. While mycobacteria do not seem to fit the Gram-positive category from an empirical standpoint (i.e. they do not retain the crystal violet stain), they are classified as an acid-fast Gram-positive bacterium due to their lack of an outer cell membrane. All <i>Mycobacterium </i>species share a characteristic cell wall, thicker than in many other bacteria, which is hydrophobic, waxy, and rich in mycolic acids/mycolates. The cell wall makes a substantial contribution to the hardiness of this genus.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0044">Many <i>Mycobacterium </i>species adapt readily to growth on very simple substrates, using ammonia or amino acids as nitrogen sources and glycerol as a carbon source in the presence of mineral salts. Optimum growth temperatures vary widely according to the species and range from 25Â° C. to over 50Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0045">Some species can be very difficult to culture (i.e. they are fastidious), sometimes taking over two years to develop in culture. Further, some species also have extremely long reproductive cycles: <i>M. leprae </i>(leprosy), may take more than 20 days to proceed through one division cycle (for comparison, some <i>E. coli </i>strains take only 20 minutes), making laboratory culture a slow process.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0046">A natural division occurs between slowlyâand rapidlyâgrowing species. Mycobacteria that form colonies clearly visible to the naked eye within 7 days on subculture are termed rapid growers, while those requiring longer periods are termed slow growers. Mycobacteria are slightly curved or straight rods between 0.2-0.6 Î¼m wide by 1.0-10 Î¼m long.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0047">A â<i>Mycobacterium </i>infectionâ includes, but is not limited to, tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infections cause by a <i>Mycobacterium </i>species other than <i>M. tuberculosis</i>. Atypical mycobacterial infections include, but are not limited to, abscesses, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis (bone infection). They can also infect the lungs, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and soft tissues. Atypical mycobacterial infections can be caused by <i>Mycobacterium avium</i>-<i>intracellulare</i>, which frequently affects AIDS patients and causes lung disease. <i>Mycobacterium </i>marinum cause skin infections and is also responsible for swimming pool granuloma. <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans </i>cause skin infections. <i>Mycobacterium kansasii </i>causes lung disease.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0048">A particularly important <i>Mycobacterium </i>species to the present invention is <i>M. tuberculosis</i>. The term âTuberculosisâ or âTBâ is used to describe the infection caused by the infective agent â<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>â or â<i>M. tuberculosis</i>â, a tubercle <i>bacillus </i>bacteria. Tuberculosis is a potentially fatal contagious disease that can affect almost any part of the body but is most frequently an infection of the lungs. It is caused by a bacterial microorganism, the tubercle <i>bacillus </i>or <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0049">Tuberculosis is primarily an infection of the lungs, but any organ system is susceptible, so its manifestations may be varied. Effective therapy and methods of control and prevention of tuberculosis have been developed, but the disease remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity throughout the world. The treatment of tuberculosis has been complicated by the emergence of drug-resistant organisms, including multiple-drug-resistant tuberculosis, especially in those with HIV infection.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0050">
        <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, the causative agent of tuberculosis, is transmitted by airborne droplet nuclei produced when an individual with active disease coughs, speaks, or sneezes. When inhaled, the droplet nuclei reach the alveoli of the lung. In susceptible individuals the organisms may then multiply and spread through lymphatics to the lymph nodes, and through the bloodstream to other sites such as the lung apices, bone marrow, kidneys, and meninges.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0051">The development of acquired immunity in 2 to 10 weeks results in a halt to bacterial multiplication. Lesions heal and the individual remains asymptomatic. Such an individual is said to have tuberculous infection without disease, and will show a positive tuberculin test. The risk of developing active disease with clinical symptoms and positive cultures for the tubercle <i>bacillus </i>diminishes with time and may never occur, but is a lifelong risk. Approximately 5% of individuals with tuberculous infection progress to active disease. Progression occurs mainly in the first 2 years after infection; household contacts and the newly infected are thus at risk.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0052">Many of the symptoms of tuberculosis, whether pulmonary disease or extrapulmonary disease, are nonspecific. Fatigue or tiredness, weight loss, fever, and loss of appetite may be present for months. A fever of unknown origin may be the sole indication of tuberculosis, or an individual may have an acute influenza-like illness. Erythema nodosum, a skin lesion, is occasionally associated with the disease.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0053">The lung is the most common location for a focus of infection to flare into active disease with the acceleration of the growth of organisms. Infections in the lung are the primary focus of the present invention. There may be complaints of cough, which can produce sputum containing mucus, pus- and, rarely, blood. Listening to the lungs may disclose rales or crackles and signs of pleural effusion (the escape of fluid into the lungs) or consolidation if present. In many, especially those with small infiltration, the physical examination of the chest reveals no abnormalities.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0054">Miliary tuberculosis is a variant that results from the blood-borne dissemination of a great number of organisms resulting in the simultaneous seeding of many organ systems. The meninges, liver, bone marrow, spleen, and genitourinary system are usually involved. The term miliary refers to the lung lesions being the size of millet seeds (about 0.08 in. or 2 mm). These lung lesions are present bilaterally. Symptoms are variable.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0055">Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is much less common than pulmonary disease. However, in individuals with AIDS, extrapulmonary tuberculosis predominates, particularly with lymph node involvement, with some pulmonary impact. For example, fluid in the lungs and lung lesions are other common manifestations of tuberculosis in AIDS. The lung is the portal of entry, and an extrapulmonary focus, seeded at the time of infection, breaks down with disease occurring.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0056">Development of renal tuberculosis can result in symptoms of burning on urination, and blood and white cells in the urine; or the individual may be asymptomatic. The symptoms of tuberculous meningitis are nonspecific, with acute or chronic fever, headache, irritability, and malaise.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0057">A tuberculous pleural effusion can occur without obvious lung involvement. Fever and chest pain upon breathing are common symptoms. Bone and joint involvement results in pain and fever at the joint site. The most common complaint is a chronic arthritis usually localized to one joint. Osteomyelitis is also usually present. Pericardial inflammation with fluid accumulation or constriction of the heart chambers secondary to pericardial scarring are two other forms of extrapulmonary disease.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0058">At present, the principal methods of diagnosis for pulmonary tuberculosis are the tuberculin skin test (an intracutaneous injection of purified protein derivative tuberculin is performed, and the injection site examined for reactivity), sputum smear and culture, and the chest x-ray. Culture and biopsy are important in making the diagnosis in extrapulmonary disease.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0059">A combination of two or more drugs is often used in the initial traditional therapy of tuberculous disease. Drug combinations are used to lessen the chance of drug-resistant organisms surviving. The preferred treatment regimen for both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis is a 6-month regimen of the antibiotics isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide given for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months. Because of the problem of drug-resistant cases, ethambutol can be included in the initial regimen until the results of drug susceptibility studies are known. Once treatment is started, improvement occurs in almost all individuals. Any treatment failure or individual relapse is usually due to drug-resistant organisms.</p>

      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0093">As an administration route, especially for tuberculosis infections, direct inhalation via the mouth using an inhaler is often used. Since embodiments of the pharmaceutical composition of the invention allows direct local administration into the airways and in particular, directly to deep channels of pulmonary tissue, the active substance contained therein produces immediate effects. Furthermore, the composition is formulated preferably as an immediate release product so that cleavage and analysis can begin soon after administration, if desired. Once the composition has been administered (the patient should be placed in the magnetic field at the same time of drug administration), the patient is positioned within a magnetic field created by a permanent magnet as otherwise disclosed herein or an electromagnet positioned in a way to provide a magnetic field to direct the administered compound to the appropriate site of activity within the lungs or other tissue of the patient. This is usually done during administration of the drug and for a period of time thereafter in order to allow the administered compound to be directed to a site of therapeutic activity within the tissue. An electromagnet may be used during administration of the compound and optionally, for a short period thereafter (generally from about a few minutes to an hour or so) and a permanent magnet may be positioned on the patient during administration of the isotopically labeled drug or for a significant period during therapy, which may last a number of weeks or months. In certain embodiments, the magnet creates a gradient field to draw the compound to the proper site within the tissue to be treated.</p>

      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0100">An ice cooled solution of Br<sub>2 </sub>(9.99 g, 62.5 mmol) in absolute pyridine (35 ml) is made. To this a solution of benzophenone-arylhydrazone (62.5 mmol) in absolute CH2C12 (70 ml) is added drop wise over 30 minutes at 0-5Â° C. Continue stirring over ice for a further 30 minutes. To this, add 300 ml absolute Ether, and stir with ice, cooling for 90 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0101">To make seeding crystals, take 2 ml of reaction mixture, add ether and scratch. Add seed crystals to major portion, harvest by filtration. Wash crystals with ether (â250 ml) remove solvent under vacuum. Yield 97%.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0102">The above salt (5.42 mmol) is overlaid with ether (30 ml), KCN (1.41. g) in 5 ml water is added, and the phases mixed vigorously with a flask shaker. The solid phase will disappear of 10-30 minutes. To this then add a further 10 ml of water, and rotary evaporate off the ether. The remaining mix of a yellow oil and water is shaken for 5 hours, will decolorize as cyanopyridine and the benzophenonearylhydrazone reform. (This happens faster if catalytic alkali sodium ethoxide/ethanol is added). The resultant crystals of the benzophenonehydrazone are removed by filtration.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0103">The water solution is saturated with NaCl, 40 mg activated charcoal added, and mixed 10 mins, and filtered through celite. The filtrate is extracted 4Ã25 ml with Ether, the organic layers pooled, dried with magnesium sulfate, and dried to produce 4-cyanopyridine. This is washed with petroleum ether (40-60Â° C. fraction) and dried. Yieldâ75%.</p>

      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0116">Isoniazid (INH) is a pro-drug that is activated by catalase peroxidase (KatG) of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </i>(Mtb) to produce isonicotinyol (INacyl) radicals: these then react with NAD to produce mycolate synthesis inhibitors. We found that INacyl radicals also decompose to release CO, and so lose the ability to produce INacyl-NAD adducts. Since CO induces dormancy in Mtb, we hypothesized that reducing this decarbonylation by selective 13C substitution (to produce heavy isoniazid, hINH) would increase activity of the resultant drug by maximizing INacyl-NAD formation, and minimizing dormancy induction by CO. Here, we describe how this 13C magnetic isotope effect (MIE) can produce more effective drugs.</p>

      <heading id="h-00018-en" level="1">Conclusion</heading>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0129">This study shows that using isotopically labeled anti-tuberculosis compounds enhances drug action over a non-isotopically labeled compound and that this activity may be further markedly enhanced by exposing compound to a magnetic field. Since hINH activity is higher, while drug-induction of dormancy lower, the application of a magnetic field to this therapeutic approach may readily enable a more rapid treatment than INH-containing drug regimens.</p>
