Several sewing technics are used to avoid unwanted bumps at the connection between fabrics. It is important to understand that all part of the swimsuit <b>1</b>, including the female breast may be covered with an external fabric <b>5</b> in order to cover differences between fabrics of the integrated molding, as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
