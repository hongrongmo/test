      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Epoxy resins are among the most important industrial polymers in the world and are used in large quantities in the production of adhesives, paints and coatings, and matrix resins. The core substrate in the production of epoxy resins is typically 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)isopropylidiene (bisphenol A). The main monomer used in the epoxy resin industry is the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A, (2,2-Bis(4-glycidyloxyphenyl)propane), which represents more than 75% of the resin used in industrial applications. This monomer is usually prepared from 2,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)isopropylidiene (bisphenol A) and epichlorohydrin using a strong base such as sodium hydroxide. Alternative synthetic methods have been developed such as allylating bisphenol A followed by epoxidization.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">One significant application for epoxy resins derived from the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A is in glass fiber reinforced laminates as rigid or flexible circuit board substrates used in a variety of industrial and consumer electronic products and electronic components. These materials must be fire resistant to meet safety requirements. The approach to render these materials fire resistant has been to use a variety of additives such as brominated compounds, phosphorous containing compounds, aluminum derivatives, melamine cyanurate, metal phosphinates and combinations thereof. Due to environmental considerations, some of the more commonly used halogenated flame retardants are being banned from use because they can leach out into the environment and are toxic. As is the case with most additives for polymers, the other flame retardants suffer from the same problem, it is just that they have not received the attention that the halogenated systems have, but many of them are toxic and they all are subject to leach out of the host resin. Thus there is a need to render epoxy derived resins fire resistant in a way that is practical, cost effective and environmentally friendly.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Processes for preparing flame retardant epoxy resins disclosed thus far are focused on the reaction of an epoxy resin with a flame-retardant additive or a curing agent or chain extender. An approach that produces an inherently flame retardant epoxy based monomer, oligomer, polymer, or co-polymer would be ideal. Phosphonate polymers, copolymers, oligomers and co-oligomers having a wide variety of chemical structures which may contain reactive end groups such as hydroxyl groups are known. However, prior art, which has disclosed the reaction of bisphenol A and epichlorohydrin with sodium hydroxide base is not applicable to phosphonate monomers or polymers, copolymers, oligomers or co-oligomers because the use of a strong base to conduct the synthesis causes hydrolysis of the phosphonate groups leading to chain cleavage (and thus reduction of molecular weight) and phosphonic acid groups as well as other unwanted reactions leading to a complex mixture of by-products.</p>

      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0031">The terms âflame retardant,â âflame resistant,â âfire resistant,â or âfire resistance,â as used herein, means that the composition exhibits a limiting oxygen index (LOI) of at least 27. âFlame retardant,â âflame resistant,â âfire resistant,â or âfire resistance,â may also be tested by measuring the after-burning time in accordance with the UL test (Subject 94). In this test, the tested materials are given classifications of UL-94 V-0, UL-94 V-1 and UL-94 V-2 on the basis of the results obtained with the ten test specimens. Briefly, the criteria for each of these UL-94-V-classifications are as follows:</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0032">UL-94 V-0: the total flaming combustion for each specimen after removal of the ignition flame should not exceed 10 seconds and the total flaming combustion for 5 specimens should not exceed 50 seconds. None of the test specimens should release and drips which ignite absorbent cotton wool.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0033">UL-94 V-1: the total flaming combustion for each specimen after removal of the ignition flame should not exceed 30 seconds and the total flaming combustion for 5 specimens should not exceed 250 seconds. None of the test specimens should release any drips which ignite absorbent cotton wool.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0034">UL-94 V-2: the total flaming combustion for each specimen after removal of the ignition flame should not exceed 30 seconds and the total flaming combustion for 5 specimens should not exceed 250 seconds. Test specimens may release flaming particles, which ignite absorbent cotton wool.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0035">Fire resistance may also be tested by measuring after-burning time. These test methods provide a laboratory test procedure for measuring and comparing the surface flammability of materials when exposed to a prescribed level of radiant heat energy to measure the surface flammability of materials when exposed to fire. The test is conducted using small specimens that are representative, to the extent possible, of the material or assembly being evaluated. The rate at which flames travel along surfaces depends upon the physical and thermal properties of the material, product or assembly under test, the specimen mounting method and orientation, the type and level of fire or heat exposure, the availability of air, and properties of the surrounding enclosure. If different test conditions are substituted or the end-use conditions are changed, it may not always be possible by or from this test to predict changes in the fire-test-response characteristics measured. Therefore, the results are valid only for the fire test exposure conditions described in this procedure.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0036">The state-of-the-art approach to rendering polymers flame retardant is to use additives such as brominated compounds or compounds containing aluminum and/or phosphorus. Use of the additives with polymer can have a deleterious effect on the processing characteristics and/or the mechanical performance of articles produced from them. In addition, some of these compounds are toxic, and can leach into the environment over time making their use less desirable. In some countries, certain brominated additives are being phased-out of use because of environmental concerns.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0037">âMolecular weight,â as used herein, can be determined by relative viscosity (Î·<sub>rel</sub>) and/or gel permeation chromatography (GPC). âRelative viscosityâ of a polymer is measured by dissolving a known quantity of polymer in a solvent and comparing the time it takes for this solution and the neat solvent to travel through a specially designed capillary (viscometer) at a constant temperature. Relative viscosity is a measurement that is indicative of the molecular weight of a polymer. It is also well known that a reduction in relative viscosity is indicative of a reduction in molecular weight, and reduction in molecular weight causes loss of mechanical properties such as strength and toughness. GPC provides information about the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of a polymer. It is known that the molecular weight distribution of a polymer is important to properties such as thermo-oxidative stability (due to different amount of end groups), toughness, melt flow, and fire resistance, for example, low molecular weight polymers drip more when burned.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0038">The term âtoughness,â as used herein, is meant to imply that the material is resistant to breaking or fracturing when stressed or impacted. There are a variety of standardized tests available to determine the toughness of a material. Generally, toughness is determined qualitatively using a film or a molded specimen.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0039">The phrase âlow viscosity when sheared,â âshear thinning,â or similar phrases, as used herein, is meant to imply that when the material is melted and subjected to a shearing force, such as that encountered with certain types of mixers or when the melt is forced with pressure through a die or body having similar orifice, the viscosity is reduced. Shear thinning behavior may be transferred to blends of materials. Thus, the blend of, for example, the hyperbranched oligophosphonates or co-oligo(phosphonate carbonate)s and a thermoplastic, may exhibit shear thinning, while the thermoplastic alone or a blend of a thermoplastic and a linear or lightly branched oligophosphonate or co-oligo(phosphonate carbonate) do not. Shear thinning can be measured using standardized methods such as the Shear Thinning Index (STI). STI represents the ratio of the viscosity at a low rpm shear to the viscosity at a high rpm, generally, about ten times the low rotational speed. For example, low shear may be 1 rpm and high shear can be 10 rpm. The higher the STI value, the more shear thinning the material exhibits.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0040">Some embodiments of the invention are directed to compositions including an epoxy resin; oligomeric phosphonates such as reactive oligophosphonates, random or block co-oligo(phosphonate ester)s, and random or block co-oligo(phosphonate carbonate)s; and one or more carbodiimides. In some embodiments, such compositions may further include additional stabilizers such as one or more phenolic antioxidants, one or more phosphite antioxidants, or a combination of phenolic antioxidants, and one or more phosphite antioxidants. The compositions of such embodiments may further include, for example, catalysts and solvents or other components known in the art. The compositions of such embodiments exhibit improved glass transition temperature, improved heat resistance, and improved flame retardancy over similar compositions lacking oligomeric phosphonates, carbodiimides, carbodiimides and phenolic antioxidants or phosphite antioxidants, oligomeric phosphonates and carbodiimides, or oligomeric phosphonates, carbodiimides, and phenolic antioxidants or phosphite antioxidants. Other embodiments are directed to methods for making such compositions and articles of manufacture composed of or incorporating such compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0041">Other embodiments of the invention are directed to compositions including an epoxy resin; oligomeric phosphonates such as reactive oligophosphonates, random or block co-oligo(phosphonate ester)s, and random or block co-oligo(phosphonate carbonate)s; and one or more phenolic antioxidants, one or more phosphite antioxidants, or a combination of phenolic antioxidants, and one or more phosphite antioxidants. In some embodiments, such compositions may further include one or more carbodiimides. The compositions of such embodiments may further include, for example, catalysts and solvents or other components known in the art. The compositions of such embodiments exhibit improved glass transition temperature, improved heat resistance, and improved flame retardancy over similar compositions lacking oligomeric phosphonates, carbodiimides, carbodiimides and phenolic antioxidants or phosphite antioxidants, oligomeric phosphonates and carbodiimides, or oligomeric phosphonates, carbodiimides, and phenolic antioxidants or phosphite antioxidants. Other embodiments are directed to methods for making such compositions and articles of manufacture composed of or incorporating such compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0042">Antioxidants such as the antioxidants described above are typically incorporated into polymer systems to improve heat stability and/or hydrolytic stability of the final compound without changing, for example, the mechanical properties or glass transition temperature of the base polymer. Surprisingly, the addition of antioxidants in the presence of reactive phosphonate oligomers in thermoset systems like epoxies was found to significantly enhance the glass transition temperature of the resulting cured formulation. Thus, compositions including epoxy resin, oligomeric phosphonates, and one or more phenolic antioxidants, one or more phosphite antioxidants, or a combination thereof may exhibit improved glass transition temperature, i.e., higher Tg, than epoxy resin compositions containing oligomeric phosphonates alone. For example, in some embodiments, epoxy compositions containing oligomeric phosphonates and one or more antioxidant may exhibit a Tg as determined by DSC of greater than 130Â° C., 135Â° C., or 140Â° C., or from about 130Â° C. to about 180Â° C., about 135Â° C. to about 170Â° C., or any range or individual value encompassed by these example ranges.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0043">The oligomeric phosphonates of such embodiments may be linear, branched, or hyperbranched. In general, the concentration of reactive end groups based on the total number of termini for the oligomeric phosphonates may be high. For example, oligomeric phosphonates may have a percentage of the total number of termini having reactive end groups of from about 80% to 100%, about 85% to about 99%, or about 90% to about 98%. In other embodiments, greater than 90% of the total termini of the oligomeric phosphonate may have a reactive end group. For branched or hyperbranched oligomeric phosphonates of other embodiments, the percentage of the total number of termini having reactive end groups may be from about 50% to 100%, about 75% to about 95%, or about 80% to about 90%, and in certain embodiments, greater than 80% of the total termini for a branched or hyperbranched oligomeric phosphonate may have a reactive end group. The term âreactive end groupsâ is used to describe any chemical moiety at a branch termination that is capable of reacting with another chemical moiety. A large number of reactive functional groups are known in the art and encompassed by the invention. In particular embodiments, the reactive end groups may be hydroxyl, epoxy, vinyl, or isocyanate groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0044">For simplicity, throughout this disclosure, the terms, âoligomeric phosphonates,â âphosphonate oligomers,â âoligophosphonates,â and the like are to be construed as referring to any type of oligomer having phosphonate containing repeating units including oligophosphonates, random or block co-oligo(phosphonate ester)s, and random or block co-oligo(phosphonate carbonate)s. Such oligomers encompassed by these terms can be linear, lightly branched, indicating a relatively small number of branches, for example, 1 to about 5 branches per oligomer, or hyperbranched, indicating a relatively high number of branches, for example, greater than 5. While individual types of oligomers may be called out in specific exemplary embodiments, any oligomeric phosphonate described herein can be used in such exemplary embodiments. For example, an exemplary stating that an oligomeric phosphonate is used can be carried out with a linear, lightly branched, or hyperbranched oligomeric phosphonate that can be an oligophosphonate, random or block co-oligo(phosphonate ester), and random or block co-oligo(phosphonate carbonate) type oligomeric phosphonate.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0045">The oligomeric phosphonates of various embodiments may be of low molecular weight. For example, in some embodiments, the molecular weight (weight average molecular weight as determined by gel permeation chromatography based on polystyrene calibration) range of the oligophosphonates may be from about 500 g/mole to about 18,000 g/mole or any value within this range. In other embodiments, the molecular weight range may be from about 1500 g/mole to about 15,000 g/mole, about 3000 g/mole to about 10,000 g/mole, or any value within these ranges. In still other embodiments, the molecular weight range may be from about 700 g/mole to about 9000 g/mole, about 1000 g/mole to about 8000 g/mole, about 3000 g/mole to about 4000 g/mole, or any value within these ranges. Low molecular weight may also be established based on the relative viscosity (Î·<sub>rel</sub>) as be determined by dissolving the sample in dichloromethane at 25Â° C. at a concentration of 0.5 g polymer/liter and measuring the solution with an Ubbelohde viscometer of from about 1.01 to about 1.20, or in some embodiments, the Î·rel can be from about 1.01 to about 1.14, about 1.01 to about 1.10, about 1.02 to about 1.08, or any individual value or range encompassed by these example ranges. In certain embodiments, the oligomeric phosphonates included in the compositions of the invention may exhibit an Î·rel of about 1.03 to about 1.05 or about 1.04 to about 1.07, or about 1.07 to about 1.14.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0046">In various embodiments, the oligomeric phosphonates may react with the epoxy. For example, a chemical reaction may occur between the phosphonate groups of the oligomeric phosphonates and the epoxy ring and secondary hydroxyl groups of the epoxy resin. This reaction occurs during the curing cycle (at temperatures &gt;150Â° C.), producing a crosslinked epoxy system with high glass transition temperature, typically greater than 160Â° C.</p>

For example, in some embodiments, the co-oligo(phosphonate carbonate)s or co-oligo(phosphonate ester)s may have a phosphorus content, of from about 1% to about 12% by weight of the total oligomer, and in other embodiments, the phosphorous content may be from about 2% to about 10% by weight of the total oligomer.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0054">Hyperbranched oligomers of various embodiments have a highly branched structure and a high degree of functionality (i.e., chemical reactivity). The branched structure of such hyperbranched oligomers creates a high concentration of terminal groups, one at the end of nearly every branch that can include a reactive functional group such as hydroxyl end groups, epoxy end groups, vinyl end groups, vinyl ester end groups, isopropenyl end groups, isocyanate end groups, and the like. In some embodiments, the hyperbranched oligomers may have a unique combination of chemical and physical properties when compared to linear oligomeric phosphonates. For example, the high degree of branching can prevent crystallization and can render chain entanglement unlikely, so the hyperbranched oligomers can exhibit solubility in organic solvents and low solution viscosity and melt viscosity especially when sheared.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0055">In some embodiments, the hyperbranched oligomers can contain branches that are not perfectly (i.e., absolutely regular) arranged. For example, various branches on a single hyperbranched oligomer may have different lengths, functional group composition, and the like and combinations thereof. Consequently, in some embodiments, the hyperbranched oligomers of the invention can have a broad molecular weight distribution. In other embodiments, the hyperbranched oligomers of the invention may be perfectly branched, including branches that are nearly identical, and have a monodisperse molecular weight distribution.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0056">The degree of branching for the hyperbranched oligomers of the invention can be defined as the number average fraction of branching groups per molecule, i.e., the ratio of terminal groups plus branch monomer units to the total number of terminal groups, branch monomer units, and linear monomer units. For linear oligomers, the degree of branching as defined by the number average fraction of branching groups per molecule is zero, and for ideal dendrimers, the degree of branching is one. Hyperbranched oligomers can have a degree of branching which is intermediate between that of linear oligomers and ideal dendrimers. For example, a degree of branching for hyperbranched oligomers may be from about 0.05 to about 1, about 0.25 to about 0.75, or about 0.3 to about 0.6, and in certain embodiments, the hyperbranched oligomers may have a number average fraction of branching groups about 0.5.</p>

      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0000">where B is the hyperbranched oligomer and w is the number of branches, v is an integer that is not zero, L is a linking group, and F is a reactive group.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0058">The linking group (L) can be any moiety compatible with the chemistry of the monomers for the oligophosphonate, co-oligo(phosphonate ester), or co-oligo(phosphonate carbonate) described above. For example, in some embodiments, L can be any unit derived from an aryl or heteroaryl group including single aryl groups, biaryl groups, triaryl groups, tetraaryl groups, and so on. In other embodiments, L can be a covalent bond linking a functional group (F) directly to the hyperbranched oligomer, and in still other embodiments, L can be a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkyl, C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkene, or C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkyne that may or may not be branched.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0059">The linking group (L) allows for attachment of one or more functional groups (F) to each branch termination of the hyperbranched oligomer. In some embodiments, each branch termination may have an attached linking group, and in other embodiments, one or more branch terminations of the hyperbranched oligomer (B) may not have an attached linking group. Such branch terminations without an attached linking group may terminate in a hydroxyl group or phenol group associated with the monomeric units of the hyperbranched oligomer. For branch terminations that include a linking group (L), each linking group may have from 0 to 5 or more associated functional groups. Thus, in some embodiments, one or more linking group of the reactive hyperbranched oligomer may have no attached functional groups, such that the branch termination associated with this linking group is substantially unreactive. In other embodiments, one or more linking group of the reactive hyperbranched oligomer may have one or more attached functional groups providing a branch termination that is potentially reactive with other monomers, oligomers, or polymers, and in still other embodiments, one or more linking groups of the reactive hyperbranched oligomer can have multiple attached functional groups. For example, two of the aryl groups associated with a triaryl group may include a functional group (F) with the third aryl group attaching the linking group to the hyperbranched polymer or oligomer. The functional group (F) may vary among embodiments and can be any chemical moiety capable of reacting with another chemical moiety. Non-limiting examples of functional groups (F) include hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, amine, cyanate, isocyanate, epoxy, glycidyl ether, vinyl, and the like and combinations thereof. The reactive hyperbranched oligomers of the present invention are reactive with a variety of functional groups such as epoxies, anhydrides, activated halides, carboxylic acids, carboxylic esters, isocyanates, aldehydes, vinyls, acetylenes, and silanes.

In various embodiments, an individual reactive hyperbranched oligomer may have a structure in which portions of the oligomer can be any of Formula I, and VIII to XIII. Thus, embodiments encompass reactive hyperbranched oligomers in having any combination of the Formulae provided above. In other embodiments, a reactive hyperbranched oligomer may be composed of substantially one or two structures of the Formulae presented above. For example, a hyperbranched oligomer may be composed of two units derived from branching agents (X) linked by a structure of Formula XI with branches of Formula IX, or a hyperbranched oligomer may be composed of three or four branching agents linked by structures of Formulae XI and XIII with branches of structure Formula IX. Of course as discussed above, any combination of Formulae are possible and could be present in a single reactive hyperbranched oligomer.</p>

      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0065">The phosphonate and carbonate content of the hyperbranched oligomeric phosphonates, random or block co-oligo(phosphonate carbonate)s, and co-oligo(phosphonate ester)s may vary among embodiments, and embodiments are not limited by the phosphonate and/or carbonate content or range of phosphonate and/or carbonate content. For example, in some embodiments, the co-oligo(phosphonate carbonate)s or co-oligo(phosphonate ester)s may have a phosphorus content, of from about 2% to about 12% by weight, 2% to about 10% by weight, or less than 10% by weight of the total oligomer.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0066">The reactive hyperbranched oligomers of various embodiments may have greater than about 40% or greater than about 50% reactive end groups based on the total number of branch terminations as determined by known titration methods. In certain embodiments, the reactive hyperbranched oligomers may have greater than about 75% or greater than 90% of the reactive end groups based on the total number of branch terminations as determined by titration methods. In further embodiments, the reactive hyperbranched oligomers may have from about 40% to about 98% reactive end groups, about 50% to about 95% reactive end groups, or from about 60% to about 90% end groups based on the total number of branch terminations. As discussed above individual branch terminations may have more than one reactive end group. Therefore, in some embodiments, the reactive hyperbranched oligomers may have greater than 100% reactive end groups. As discussed above, the term âreactive end groupsâ is used to describe any chemical moiety at a branch termination that is capable of reacting with another chemical moiety. A large number of reactive functional groups are known in the art and encompassed by the invention. In particular embodiments, the reactive end groups may be hydroxyl, epoxy, vinyl, or isocyanate groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0067">Without wishing to be bound by theory, due to their hyperbranched nature, the reactive hyperbranched oligomers of the invention may exhibit low melt viscosities when sheared as compared to linear oligomeric phosphonates. Thus, the reactive hyperbranched oligomers described herein can be blended with monomers, oligomers, and polymers without diminishing melt processability. The hyperbranched oligophosphonates of various embodiments, therefore, can provide better meltability and improved processing. In addition, the reactive hyperbranched oligomers of the invention may be of higher molecular weight and provide greater reactivity increasing the crosslinking and improving the toughness of polymer compositions over similar compositions prepared using linear oligomeric phosphonates. In some embodiments, the reactive hyperbranched oligomers of the invention may be used as reactive or non-reactive additives in thermoplastics to improve shear thinning. For example, hyperbranched oligomers may be prepared that have no or very few reactive end groups that can be used to improve shear thinning without reacting, or crosslinking, the polymer to which the oligomers are added.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0068">The oligomeric phosphonates of various embodiments including linear and hyperbranched oligophosphonates can exhibit a high molecular weight and/or a narrow molecular weight distribution (i.e., low polydispersity). For example, in some embodiments, the oligomeric phosphonates may have a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of about 1,000 g/mole to about 18,000 g/mole as determined by Î·<sub>rel </sub>or GPC, and in other embodiments, the oligomeric phosphonates may have a Mw of from about 1,000 to about 15,000 g/mole as determined by Î·<sub>rel </sub>or GPC. The number average molecular weight (Mn), in such embodiments, may be from about 1,000 g/mole to about 10,000 g/mole, or from about 1,000 g/mole to about 5,000 g/mole, and in certain embodiments the Mn may be greater than about 1,200 g/mole. The narrow molecular weight distribution (i.e., Mw/Mn) of such oligomeric phosphonates may be from about 1 to about 7 in some embodiments and from about 1 to about 5 in other embodiments. In still other embodiments, the co-oligo(phosphonate carbonate)s may have a relative viscosity (Î·<sub>rel</sub>) of from about 1.01 to about 1.20. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the relatively high molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution of the oligomeric phosphonates of the invention may impart a superior combination of properties. For example, the oligomeric phosphonates of embodiments are extremely flame retardant and exhibit superior hydrolytic stability and can impart such characteristics on a polymer combined with the oligomeric phosphonates to produce polymer compositions such as those described below. In addition, the oligomeric phosphonates of embodiments, generally, exhibit an excellent combination of processing characteristics including, for example, good thermal and mechanical properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0069">The concentration of oligomeric phosphonates in the compositions of various embodiments may vary and any concentration that provides a suitable combination of glass transition temperature, heat resistance, and flame retardancy can be used. For example, in some embodiments, the compositions described above may include about 5 percent by weight (wt. %) to about 60 wt. %. In other embodiments, the compositions described above may include about 10 wt. % to about 50 wt. %, about 15 wt. % to about 45 wt. %, about 20 wt. % to about 40 wt. %, or any individual concentration or range of concentrations encompassed by these example ranges.</p>
