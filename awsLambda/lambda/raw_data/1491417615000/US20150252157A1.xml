      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a metal particle dispersion, an article and sintered film using the metal particle dispersion, and a method for producing a sintered film.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Fine metal particles having a particle diameter of several nanometers to several tens of nanometers show various kinds of physical and chemical characteristics that are different from those of conventional metal materials. Accordingly, it is expected that such fine metal particles can be applied in a wide range of areas such as electroconductive paste, transparent electroconductive film, light blocking filter, chemical sensor, catalyst, antimicrobial material, light guiding member, gas barrier material, light scattering/reflecting member, light diffusing member, photosensitive material, photoelectric conversion element, fluorescent material and color material. The metal particles can be formed into a metal particle dispersion in the form of ink or paste by being dispersed in a solvent.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">For example, a metal particle dispersion in which metal particles comprising a metal oxide such as ITO (tin-doped indium oxide) or ATO (antimony-doped tin oxide) are uniformly dispersed in a matrix material, is used for the purpose of forming a transparent electroconductive film or a heat ray shielding film. In this case, when metal particles having a particle diameter of more than several tens of nanometers are used, visible light is scattered and thus the film looks cloudy. By using metal particles having a particle diameter of less than several tens of nanometers, it is expected that a highly transparent optical material can be obtained, which is able to inhibit light scattering.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">For metal particles, it is known that the melting point is dramatically decreased by reducing the size. This is because as the particle diameter decreases, the specific surface area increases and thus the surface energy increases. By using this effect, the sintering of metal particles can be promoted at lower temperature than ever before, in the method of forming a circuit pattern by directly printing a pattern on a base material, using a metal particle dispersion. Accordingly, it is expected that it would be possible to increase productivity dramatically higher than conventional methods such as a photoresist method, and also it would be possible to form circuits on resin base materials with low heat resistance, which have been difficult to use, by printing.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">As just described, fine metal particles are widely used in the form of metal particle dispersions, and fine metal particle dispersions with better dispersibility and dispersion stability have been desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In Patent Literature 1, as a technique to obtain excellent dispersion stability of metal oxide fine particles, a coating composition for an antireflection film is disclosed, which contains a specific type of metal oxide fine particles, a non-ionic organic dispersant, a binder and an organic solvent.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In Patent Literature 2, as an ink composition that is capable of printing an image or a letter having excellent metallic luster by an inkjet printing method, the use of metal colloid particles is disclosed, which are prepared by coating metal nanoparticles with protective colloid containing an organic compound having a carboxyl group and a polymer dispersant.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">However, the methods of Patent Literatures 1 and 2 need a large amount of dispersant to disperse highly concentrated metal particles, and a further increase in dispersibility has been required.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">A metal microparticle dispersion is disclosed in Patent Literature 3, which contains a specific type of metal microparticles, a polymeric dispersant having a specific polyester skeleton, and a dispersion medium.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Patent Literature 3 describes that the specific polymeric dispersant have a high effect on the dispersibility of the metal microparticles and can be easily volatilized at a subsequent burning step. However, as shown in the below-mentioned Comparative Examples, by the method of Patent Literature 3, the storage stability of the metal microparticle dispersion cannot be sufficient; therefore, the metal microparticles sometimes precipitate after a certain period of storage.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">As described above, there is a demand for a metal particle dispersion in which fine metal particles are uniformly dispersed. However, in general, since metal particles have high specific gravity and are likely to precipitate, it is quite difficult to obtain a dispersion with high dispersibility and dispersion stability. Also, as the particle diameter decreases, it is more difficult to prepare a dispersion with excellent dispersibility and dispersion stability.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The present invention was achieved in light of the above circumstances. An object of the present invention is to provide a metal particle dispersion which has excellent dispersibility and dispersion stability and in which the precipitation of the metal particles is inhibited, and an article comprising a coating film, molded product or sintered film of the metal particle dispersion according to the present invention or of a composition containing the metal particle dispersion according to the present invention.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">To achieve the above object, the inventors of the present invention made diligent research and have found that by using specific metal particles in combination with a specific dispersant, it is possible to obtain excellent dispersibility and dispersion stability.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The present invention was completed based on this finding.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The metal particle dispersion of the present invention comprises metal particles, a dispersant and a solvent,</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">wherein the metal particles contain one or more selected from the group consisting of gold, silver, copper, nickel, platinum, palladium, molybdenum, aluminum, antimony, tin, chromium, lanthanum, indium, gallium and germanium, and</p>

      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0054">Due to the use of the above-specified metal particles in combination with the above-specified dispersant, the metal particle dispersion of the present invention is a metal particle dispersion which has excellent dispersibility and dispersion stability and in which the precipitation of the metal particles is inhibited. Also, the metal particle dispersion of the present invention can be a low-viscosity dispersion.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0055">The mechanism that the effect as specified above is exerted by the above-specified combination, is not completely clear. However, it is presumed as follows.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0056">Conventionally, there is such a problem with metal particle dispersions that since metal particles have larger specific gravity than other components in dispersions, they precipitate during storage.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0057">In the metal particle dispersion of the present invention, the metal particles are dispersed by using, as the dispersant, the graft copolymer having at least one constitutional unit represented by the general formula (I) and at least one constitutional unit represented by the general formula (II), in which at least part of nitrogen sites of the constitutional units represented by the general formula (I) each form a salt with at least one selected from the group consisting of a halogenated hydrocarbon, a specific acidic phosphorus compound, and a specific sulfonic acid compound. Accordingly, it is presumed that the salt-forming site in the dispersant becomes insoluble in solvent and firmly adsorbs to the metal particle surface; therefore, the dispersion of the metal particles is stabilized. Also, because the constitutional unit represented by the general formula (II) of the dispersant has the polymer chain, its solubility in solvent is excellent. Because of this, the above-specified dispersant surrounds the metal particles and is stably present in the solvent. Therefore, it is presumed that the aggregation of the metal particles is less likely to occur; excellent dispersibility and dispersion stability are obtained; and the precipitation of the metal particles can be inhibited.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0058">As described above, because the metal particle dispersion of the present invention has excellent metal particle dispersibility and dispersion stability, the content ratio of the dispersant to the metal particles can be decreased lower than ever before. Therefore, the metal particle dispersion of the present invention can be a low-viscosity fine metal particle dispersion. Also, when a metal film is formed by baking the metal particle dispersion, there is such an advantage that less organic components remain in the film after sintering.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0059">In the present invention, a specific indication of low viscosity is that the viscosity of the metal particle dispersion is 10 mPaÂ·s or less, preferably 3 mPaÂ·s or less. The metal particle dispersion with such a low viscosity can be also preferably used as a composition for inkjet.</p>

The sintered film of the metal particles containing the metal compound can be preferably used as a photoelectric conversion semiconductor film, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0080">The metal particles containing one more of the above-mentioned metals, alloys and metal compounds can be used solely or in combination of two or more.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0081">For example, when used to form a sintered film, the dispersion can be a mixture of copper particles and one or more kinds of metal compound particles each containing one or more selected from the group consisting of indium, gallium, zinc, tin and aluminum and one or more selected from the group consisting of sulfur, selenium and tellurium, for example. Or, the dispersion can be a mixture of two or more kinds of metal compound particles each containing one or more selected from the group consisting of copper, indium, gallium, zinc, tin and aluminum and one or more selected from the group consisting of sulfur, selenium and tellurium.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0082">The method for preparing the metal particles can be appropriately selected from conventionally known methods. For example, the metal particles can be obtained by: physical methods of grinding metal powder by mechanochemical treatment, etc.; chemical dry methods such as a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, a vapor deposition method, a sputtering method, a thermal plasma method and a laser method; and chemical wet methods such as a thermal decomposition method, a chemical reduction method, an electrolysis method, a ultrasonication method, a laser ablation method, a supercritical fluid method and a microwave synthesis method.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0083">For example, in the vapor deposition method, fine particles are produced by bringing a thermally evaporated metal vapor into contact with a low vapor pressure liquid containing a dispersant, under high vacuum.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0084">An example of the chemical reduction method is a method of producing fine particles by mixing a metal oxide and a reducing agent in a solvent, in the presence of a complexing agent and a protective colloid.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0085">The complexing agent is such an agent that the donor atom of the ligand of the complexing agent binds to a metal ion or atom to form a metal complex compound. As the donor atom, a nitrogen atom, an oxygen atom and a sulfur atom are preferred. Examples of complexing agents in which the donor atom is a nitrogen atom include, but not limited to, amines and nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring compounds such as imidazole and pyridine.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0086">The protective colloid functions as a dispersion stabilizer for refined metal particles. Concrete examples thereof include: protein-based organic protective agents such as gelatin, arabic gum and casein; natural polymers such as starch and dextrin; cellulose-based organic protective agents such as hydroxyethyl cellulose; and hydrophilic synthetic polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol.

      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0088">The average primary particle diameter of the metal particles can be appropriately determined, depending on the intended use. In general, it is determined in a range of 1 to 500 nm. From the point of view that low viscosity, excellent dispersibility and dispersion stability can be obtained and precipitates are less likely to occur, the average primary particle diameter of the metal particles is preferably 5 to 200 nm.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0089">The average particle diameter of the metal particles can be obtained by the method of directly measuring the size of primary particles shown on an electron microscopy image. More specifically, the short-axis and long-axis diameters of each primary particle are measured, and the average was used as the particle diameter of each particle. Next, for 100 or more particles, the volume (mass) of each particle was obtained by approximating its volume (mass) by the volume (mass) of a cuboid with the above-obtained particle diameter, and the volume average particle diameter was obtained therefrom and used as the average particle diameter. The same result can be obtained by using any of a transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) as the electron microscope.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0090">In the metal particle dispersion of the present invention, the content of the metal particles can be appropriately determined, depending on the intended use. From the viewpoint of dispersibility, the content is preferably in a range of 1 to 70% by mass, more preferably in a range of 5 to 50% by mass, with respect to the total amount of the metal particle dispersion. In the present invention, by using the metal particles in combination with the below-described dispersant, excellent metal particle dispersibility and dispersion stability can be obtained and precipitates are less likely occur, even when the content of the metal particles is higher than ever before.</p>

      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0145">The reason why R<sup>5 </sup>and R<sup>9 </sup>are determined in this way is that particularly excellent metal particle dispersibility and dispersion stability can be obtained when the constitutional unit containing R<sup>5 </sup>or R<sup>9 </sup>has solubility in the solvent and the salt-forming site formed by the basic site of the monomer has high adsorption properties to metal particles.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0146">It is preferable that R<sup>5 </sup>and R<sup>9 </sup>are appropriately selected depending on the intended use of the metal particle dispersion.

For example, when a polymerizable oligomer containing a polymer chain and a group having an ethylenically unsaturated double bond at a terminal of the chain is used for introducing a polymer chain into the graft copolymer, the polymerizable oligomer is needed to have the above solubility. When a copolymer is formed by monomers each containing a group having an ethylenically unsaturated double bond, and then a polymer chain is introduced into the graft copolymer by a polymer chain having a reactive group that is reactive with the reactive group contained in the copolymer, the polymer chain having the reactive group is needed to have the solubility.</p>

The metal particle dispersion of Comparative Example 1, the dispersion comprising the dispersant which has the constitutional unit represented by the general formula (I) and the constitutional unit represented by the general formula (II) and in which no salt is formed, produced precipitates and has poor dispersion stability. The metal particle dispersions of Comparative Examples 2 to 5, the dispersions comprising the commercially-available dispersants, produced precipitates and have poor dispersion stability. It is also clear that Comparative Examples 2 to 5 have high sheet surface resistances and poor low-temperature sintering properties.</p>
