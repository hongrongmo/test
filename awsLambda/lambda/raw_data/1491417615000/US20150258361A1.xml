      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The invention relates to fitness equipment for muscle training, in particular to a pull training device which forms a tension system by combining two kinds of diving forces.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In professional training, muscles should be specifically trained to generate an explosive power and quick reaction. The explosive power depends on muscle strength transmission and muscle contraction speed. The method for increasing strength of the muscles is increasing the quantity of muscle fibers and enlarging the muscles, while the method for speeding up muscle contraction is different from the pure strength training mode and emphasizes on periodic change of the strength.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Two common types of traditional pull training equipment are available. One type is tension springs. The tension spring devices are stretched by pulling. As the devices are stretched, a bigger force is required. For example, the CN2032080 discloses an elastic all-around trainer comprised of a hook and an elastic chest expander as well as a plurality of rubber belts. The muscles are trained through pulling the device with arms. The other is adjustable rated-balance-weight lifting devices. For example, the CN 202136742 U discloses a forearm trainer. This forearm trainer adjusts the muscle training degree and strength through installing balance weights on the lifting device which generates a pull. The inherent weight of the balance weights are transmitted to the pull training handle through a steel cable. The process of applying a force is an anti-gravity working process. The number of balance weights on the lifting device is in proportional to the pull needed.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">It is not hard to see from the pull configuration and output mode that the above two devices provide single pull sources. One is equidifferent weight gaining and the other is linear weight gaining Those two devices can only train the muscle strength in terms of pull, and fails to train the contraction and relaxation speed of the muscles in terms of muscle response.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Aiming at the above-mentioned problems, the invention provides a pull training device capable of changing the pull in an action circle. The device can provide muscle strength training and muscle-contracting and—relaxing type reactive training in a circle.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The technical scheme of a pull training device of the invention is as follows. A pull training device comprises a pull grip, a cable having an end connected with the pull grip and a power module which is connected with the other end of the cable and can pull the cable. The power module includes a power input unit and a power output unit. The power input unit includes a motor and a cylinder combined with the motor in a torsional manner. The power output unit includes a rotating wheel and a winding shaft. The motor is connected to the rotating shaft of the rotating wheel. The cylinder is connected to spokes of the rotating wheel. The winding shaft is coaxial with the rotating shaft. The cable is coiled on the winding shaft.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The power input unit can be driven by the motor and the cylinder at the same time. The motor drives the power input unit by a rotating driving force at a constant speed, while the cylinder drives the power input unit by a periodically changing force.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The cylinder has a piston moving up and down. The piston has a rotational rigid link rod; one end of the link rod is rotationally connected to the piston, while the other end is fixed at the spokes of the rotating wheel.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">A pull training device comprises a pull grip, a cable having an end connected to the pull grip and a power module connected to the other end of the cable and can pull the cable. The power module includes a power input unit and a power output unit. The power input unit includes a motor, a cylinder combined with the motor in a torsional manner and a first rotating wheel. The moor is connected to the rotating shaft of the first rotating wheel. The cylinder is connected to the spokes of the first rotating wheel. The power output unit includes a second rotating wheel and a winding shaft. The winding shaft is coaxial with the second rotating shaft. The cable is coiled on the winding shaft. The first rotating wheel and the second rotating wheel transmit rotation there-between through a transmission belt.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The transmission belt is a V-shaped transmission belt. The first rotating wheel and the second rotating wheel both have a V-shape belt trough.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The cylinder has a piston moving up and down. The piston has a rotational rigid link rod; one end of the link rod is rotationally connected to the piston, while the other end is fixed at the spokes of the first rotating wheel.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">A method for generating combined torsion in the pull training device is provided. The power input unit is driven by the motor and the cylinder at the same time. The motor drives the power input unit by a rotating driving force at a constant speed, while the cylinder drives the power input unit by a periodically changing force.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The pull training device comprises a pull grip, a cable having an end connected to the pull grip and a power module. The power module is connected with the other end of the cable and drives the cable. The power module includes a power input unit and a power output unit. The power input unit includes a first rotating wheel, a motor, and a cylinder combined with the motor in a torsional manner. The motor is connected to the rotating shaft of the first rotating wheel. The cylinder is connected to the spokes of the rotating wheel. The power output unit includes a second rotating wheel and a winding shaft. The winding shaft is coaxial with the second rotating shaft. The cable is coiled on the winding shaft. The first rotating wheel and the second rotating wheel transmit rotation there-between through a transmission belt. The motor drives the rotating shaft of the first rotating wheel at a constant rotating speed, while the cylinder drives the spokes of the first rotating wheel by a periodically changing force.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The invention has the following beneficial effects: in a rotation circle of the rotating wheel driven by a pull, the torsion formed by the cylinder and motor together changes periodically, so the pull provided for training muscles is not a single source, but changes regularly. Muscles generate power to resist the periodically changing pull, thus fulfilling the aim of training and exercising the muscles. The device trains muscles in a quick contraction and relaxation mode.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Refer to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, a pull training device comprises a pull grip <b>1</b>, a cable <b>20</b> having an end connected with the pull grip <b>10</b> and a power module connected with the other end of the cable <b>20</b> and can pull the cable. The power module includes a power input unit <b>31</b> and a power output unit <b>32</b>. The power input unit <b>31</b> includes a motor <b>311</b> and a cylinder <b>312</b> combined with the <b>311</b> motor in a torsional manner. The power output unit <b>32</b> includes a rotating wheel <b>321</b> and a winding shaft <b>322</b>. The motor <b>311</b> is connected to the rotating shaft of the rotating wheel <b>321</b>. The cylinder <b>312</b> is connected to spokes of the rotating wheel <b>321</b>. The winding shaft <b>322</b> is coaxial with the rotating shaft <b>321</b>. The cable <b>20</b> is coiled on the winding shaft <b>322</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The power input unit <b>31</b> is driven by the motor <b>311</b> and the cylinder <b>312</b> at the same time. The motor <b>311</b> drives the power input unit by a rotating driving force at a constant speed, meaning that the force input by the motor to the power input unit is constant, single, unchanged force. This driving force is fixed force. The cylinder <b>312</b> drives the power input unit <b>31</b> by a driving force that changes periodically. The cylinder <b>312</b> is provided with a piston <b>3121</b> moving up and down. The piston <b>3121</b> has a rotational rigid link rod <b>3122</b>. One end of the link rod <b>3122</b> is rotationally connected to the piston <b>3121</b>, while the other end is fixed at the spokes of the rotating wheel <b>321</b>. The movable piston in the cylinder is provided with two extreme moving positions, namely a highest position and a lowest position, while the middle position is a balance position. When the piston moves downward from the highest position to the balance position, a directional force promoting the movement is called a first driving force; when the piston moves downward from the balance position to the lowest position, a directional force resisting the movement is called resistance; when the piston moves upward from the lowest position to the balance position, a directional force promoting the movement is called a second driving force; when the piston moves upward from the balance position to the highest position, a second resistance is generated. In such a way, the cylinder periodically provides a driving force that changes periodically to the power input unit <b>31</b>.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Refer to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a pull training device is provided, different from the embodiment <b>1</b> in that: the power input unit <b>31</b>′ includes a motor <b>311</b>′, a cylinder <b>312</b>′ combined with the motor <b>311</b>′ in a torsional manner and a first rotating wheel <b>313</b>′; the motor <b>311</b>′ is connected to the rotating shaft of the first rotating wheel <b>313</b>′; the cylinder <b>312</b>′ is connected to the spokes of the first rotating wheel <b>313</b>′; the power output unit <b>32</b>′ comprises a second rotating shaft <b>321</b>′ and a winding shaft <b>322</b>′; the winding shaft <b>322</b>′ is coaxial with the second rotating wheel <b>321</b>′; the cable <b>20</b>′ is coiled on the winding shaft <b>322</b>′; the pull grip <b>10</b> is connected to the tail end of the cable <b>20</b>; the first rotating wheel <b>313</b>′ and the second rotating wheel <b>321</b>′ transmit rotation there-between through a transmission belt <b>33</b>′.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In this embodiment, an original rotating wheel is divided into two different rotating wheels, a first rotating wheel and a second rotating wheel. The first rotating wheel and the second rotating wheel respectively play the roles of the power input unit and the power output unit, while the two rotating wheels transmit rotation there-between through the transmission belt <b>33</b>′. However, it can be clear that the transmission belt <b>33</b>′ is not the only transmission part that can drive the two rotating wheels. Any transmission part that can transmit rotation between the two rotating wheels can be the substitute scheme.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Furthermore, the transmission belt <b>33</b>′ is a V-shaped transmission belt. The first rotating wheel and the second rotating wheel both have a V-shape belt trough.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">A method for generating combined torsion in the pull training device is provided. The power input unit is driven by the motor and the cylinder at the same time. The motor drives the power input unit by a rotating driving force at a constant speed, while the cylinder drives the power input unit by a periodically changing force.</p>

Muscles generate power to resist the periodically changing pull to fulfill the aim of training and exercising the muscles. The device trains muscles in a quick contracting and relaxation mode.</p>
