      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">A. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention is in the field of animal health and relates to novel porcine parvovirus strains, including attenuated strains for vaccination, methods of manufacture and methods of treatment using vaccines obtained from said novel parvovirus strains.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">B. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Parvoviruses infect a wide variety of animal species, and some of them are responsible for severe clinical diseases, but the majority of these viruses cause only mild or subclinical infections. They belong to the family Parvoviridae and form two subfamilies: Densovirinae, whose members infect insects, and Parvovirinae, whose members infect vertebrates. The latter subfamily currently includes five genera: <i>Dependovirus, Erythrovirus, Amdovirus, Bocavirus </i>and <i>Parvovirus </i>(1).</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Parvovirus virions are non-enveloped and contain single-stranded, linear DNA genomes of approximately 5-6 kilobases (kb). The genome consists of two main open reading frames (ORF) that encode the non-structural and capsid proteins. The newly described bocaviruses carry a third ORF, between the two major ORFs (1).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The classical porcine parvovirus (PPV1) strains of the genus <i>Parvovirus </i>are widely distributed around the world and are responsible for reproductive disorders of pigs, especially in herds where vaccination protocols are not followed correctly or vaccine efficacy is decreased due to immunosuppressive factors. During the last decade, a number of new parvoviruses have been detected in pigs. These include porcine parvovirus 2 (PPV2) (2) and related viruses (3). A new group of porcine and bovine parvoviruses, namely the hokoviruses (PHoV, BHoV), were identified in Hong Kong (4), and these viruses were found to be genetically similar to human PARV4 and 5. Although they were originally named hokoviruses after Hong Kong, a new classification of PHoV as PPV3 was proposed (5). PPV4 shows the highest similarity to bovine parvovirus 2, but the coding capacity and genome organization are similar to those of bocaviruses, as PPV4 encodes an additional ORF3 like bocaviruses, located between ORF1 and ORF2. The PPV4-encoded putative ORF3 protein, however, is quite different from that of bocaviruses (5).</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">There is an ongoing need to monitor swine for the emergence of new viruses, and to develop vaccines, treatments and methods of detection for new viruses.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0056">The invention provides nucleic acids and fragments thereof, polypeptides and immunologically-effective fragments thereof, vaccines, immunologically-effective preparations, antibodies, diagnostic assays and kits, and methods of making and using said compositions and preparations, related to the herein-disclosed novel porcine parvovirus 5A and variants thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0057">The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of molecular biology, microbiology, recombinant DNA technology, protein chemistry and immunology, which are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. See, e.g., Sambrook, Fritsch &amp; Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Vols. I, II and III, Second Edition (1989); DNA Cloning, Vols. I and II (D. N. Glover ed. 1985); Oligonucleotide Synthesis (M. J. Gait ed. 1984); Nucleic Acid Hybridization (B. D. Hames &amp; S. J. Higgins eds. 1984); Animal Cell Culture (R. K. Freshney ed. 1986); Immobilized Cells and Enzymes (IRL press, 1986); Perbal, B., A Practical Guide to Molecular Cloning (1984); the series, Methods In Enzymology (S. Colowick and N. Kaplan eds., Academic Press, Inc.); Protein purification methodsâa practical approach (E. L. V. Harris and S. Angal, eds., IRL Press at Oxford University Press); and Handbook of Experimental Immunology, Vols. I-IV (D. M. Weir and C. C. Blackwell eds., 1986, Blackwell Scientific Publications).</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0058">Before describing the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular DNA, polypeptide sequences or process parameters as such may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments of the invention only, and is not intended to be limiting. It must be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms âaâ, âanâ and âtheâ include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to âan antigenâ includes a mixture of two or more antigens, reference to âan excipientâ includes mixtures of two or more excipients, and the like.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">A. DEFINITIONS</heading>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0059">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this invention belongs at the time of filing. The meaning and scope of terms should be clear; however, in the event of any latent ambiguity, definitions provided herein take precedent over any dictionary or extrinsic definition. Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. Herein, the use of âorâ means âand/orâ unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, the use of the term âincludingâ, as well as other forms such as âincludesâ and âincludedâ is not limiting. All patents and publications referred to herein are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0060">âProtection against disease,â âprotective immunity,â âfunctional immunityâ and similar phrases, means a response against a disease or condition generated by administration of one or more therapeutic compositions of the invention, or a combination thereof, that results in fewer deleterious effects than would be expected in a non-immunized subject that has been exposed to disease or infection. That is, the severity of the deleterious effects of the infection are lessened in a vaccinated subject. Infection may be reduced, slowed, or possibly fully prevented, in a vaccinated subject. Herein, where complete prevention of infection is meant, it is specifically stated. If complete prevention is not stated then the term includes partial prevention.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0061">Herein, âreduction of the incidence and/or severity of clinical signsâ or âreduction of clinical symptomsâ means, but is not limited to, reducing the number of infected subjects in a group, reducing or eliminating the number of subjects exhibiting clinical signs of infection, or reducing the severity of any clinical signs that are present in one or more subjects, in comparison to wild-type infection. For example, it should refer to any reduction of pathogen load, pathogen shedding, reduction in pathogen transmission, or reduction of any clinical sign symptomatic of infection with PPV5A. Preferably these clinical signs are reduced in one or more subjects receiving the therapeutic composition of the present invention by at least 10% in comparison to subjects not receiving the composition and that become infected. More preferably clinical signs are reduced in subjects receiving a composition of the present invention by at least 20%, preferably by at least 30%, more preferably by at least 40%, and even more preferably by at least 50%.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0062">The term âincreased protectionâ herein means, but is not limited to, a significant reduction of one or more clinical symptoms which are associated with infection by an infectious agent, preferably PPV5A, in a vaccinated group of subjects vs. a non-vaccinated control group of subjects. The term âsignificant reduction of clinical symptomsâ means, but is not limited to, the frequency in the incidence of at least one clinical symptom in the vaccinated group of subjects is at least 10%, preferably 20%, more preferably 30%, even more preferably 50%, and even more preferably 70% lower than in the non-vaccinated control group after the challenge the infectious agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0063">âLong-lasting protectionâ shall refer to âimproved efficacyâ that persists for at least 3 weeks, but more preferably at least 3 months, still more preferably at least 6 months. In the case of livestock, it is most preferred that the long lasting protection shall persist until the average age at which animals are marketed for meat.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0064">An âimmunogenic or immunological compositionâ refers to a composition of matter that comprises at least one PPV5A protein or polypeptide, or immunogenic portion thereof, that elicits an immunological response in the host of a cellular or antibody-mediated immune response to the composition. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an immunogenic composition induces an immune response and, more preferably, confers protective immunity against one or more of the clinical signs of a PPV5A infection.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0065">An âimmunogenicâ PPV5A polypeptide, or âantigenâ as used herein refer to a polypeptide or protein that elicits an immunological response as described herein. An âimmunogenicâ PPV5A protein or polypeptide includes the full-length sequence of any of the coding sequences identified herein or analogs or immunogenic fragments thereof. The term âimmunogenic fragmentâ or âimmunogenic portionâ refers to a fragment or truncated and/or substituted form of an amino acid sequence of a PPV5A protein that includes one or more epitopes and thus elicits the immunological response described herein. In general, such truncated and/or substituted forms, or fragments will comprise or encode at least six contiguous amino acids from the full-length protein, e.g., the capsid protein. More preferably, the truncated or substituted forms, or fragments will have at least 10, more preferably at least 15, and still more preferably at least 19, and even more preferably 30 contiguous amino acids from the full-length protein, e.g., the capsid protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0066">The term âepitopeâ means a segment or fragment of a composition of matter, e.g., a protein or polypeptide, which is recognized by the immune system, specifically by antibodies, B cells, or T cells. In the present invention, the epitope is generally a fragment or fragments of a polypeptide sequence of a viral protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0067">Such fragments can be identified using any number of epitope mapping techniques, well known in the art. See, e.g., Epitope Mapping Protocols in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 66 (Glenn E. Morris, Ed., 1996) Humana Press, Totowa, N.J. For example, linear epitopes may be determined by concurrently synthesizing large numbers of peptides on solid supports, the peptides corresponding to portions of the protein molecule, and reacting the peptides with antibodies while the peptides are still attached to the supports. Such techniques are known and described in the art, see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,708,871; Geysen et al. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3998-4002; and Geysen et al. (1986) Molec. Immunol. 23:709-715. Similarly, conformational epitopes are readily identified by determining spatial conformation of amino acids such as by, e.g., x-ray crystallography and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. See Epitope Mapping Protocols, supra. Synthetic antigens are also included within the definition, for example, polyepitopes, flanking epitopes, and other recombinant or synthetically derived antigens. See, e.g., Bergmann et al. (1993) Eur. J. Immunol. 23:2777-2781; Bergmann et al. (1996), J. Immunol. 157:3242-3249; Suhrbier, A.

      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0068">An âimmune responseâ or âimmunological responseâ means, but is not limited to, the development of a cellular and/or antibody-mediated immune response to the composition or vaccine of interest. Usually, an immune or immunological response includes, but is not limited to, one or more of the following effects: the production or activation of antibodies, B cells, helper T cells, suppressor T cells, and/or cytotoxic T cells, directed specifically to an antigen or antigens included in the composition or vaccine of interest. Preferably, the host will display either a therapeutic or a protective immunological (memory) response such that resistance to new infection will be enhanced and/or the clinical severity of the disease reduced. Such protection will be demonstrated by either a reduction in number of symptoms, severity of symptoms, or the lack of one or more of the symptoms associated with the infection of the pathogen, a delay in the of onset of viremia, reduced viral persistence, a reduction in the overall viral load and/or a reduction of viral excretion.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0069">Herein, âspecifically immunoreactiveâ refers to an immunoreactive protein or polypeptide that recognizes an antigen characteristic of PPV5A infection but does not react with an antigen characteristic of a strict challenge control. To determine the specificity of a potential PPV5A immunoreactive protein or other polypeptide, various immunoassays (ELISA, IFA, WesternBlot) would be used to test the protein against animal sera containing genetically similar viruses. The protein would also be tested in various immunoassays against material containing proteins related to the expression method (Baculovirus, Sf9 cells, etc.).</p>

In some preferred embodiments, and especially those that include lyophilized immunogenic compositions, stabilizing agents for use in the present invention include stabilizers for lyophilization or freeze-drying.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0071">In some embodiments, the immunogenic composition of the present invention contains an adjuvant. âAdjuvantsâ as used herein, can include aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate, saponins e.g., Quil A, QS-21 (Cambridge Biotech Inc., Cambridge Mass.), GPI-0100 (Galenica Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Birmingham, Ala.), water-in-oil emulsion, oil-in-water emulsion, water-in-oil-in-water emulsion. The emulsion can be based in particular on light liquid paraffin oil (European Pharmacopea type); isoprenoid oil such as squalane or squalene; oil resulting from the oligomerization of alkenes, in particular of isobutene or decene; esters of acids or of alcohols containing a linear alkyl group, more particularly plant oils, ethyl oleate, propylene glycol di-(caprylate/caprate), glyceryl tri-(caprylate/caprate) or propylene glycol dioleate; esters of branched fatty acids or alcohols, in particular isostearic acid esters. The oil is used in combination with emulsifiers to form the emulsion. The emulsifiers are preferably nonionic surfactants, in particular esters of sorbitan, of mannide (e.g. anhydromannitol oleate), of glycol, of polyglycerol, of propylene glycol and of oleic, isostearic, ricinoleic or hydroxystearic acid, which are optionally ethoxylated, and polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene copolymer blocks, in particular the Pluronic products, especially L121. See Hunter et al., The Theory and Practical Application of Adjuvants (Ed. Stewart-Tull, D. E. S.), JohnWiley and Sons, NY, pp 51-94 (1995) and Todd et al., Vaccine 15:564-570 (1997). Exemplary adjuvants are the SPT emulsion described on page 147 of âVaccine Design, The Subunit and Adjuvant Approachâ edited by M. Powell and M. Newman, Plenum Press, 1995, and the emulsion MF59 described on page 183 of this same book.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0072">A further instance of an adjuvant is a compound chosen from the polymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid and the copolymers of maleic anhydride and alkenyl derivative. Advantageous adjuvant compounds are the polymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid which are cross-linked, especially with polyalkenyl ethers of sugars or polyalcohols. These compounds are known by the term carbomer (Phameuropa Vol. 8, No. 2, June 1996). Persons skilled in the art can also refer to U.S. Pat. No. 2,909,462 which describes such acrylic polymers cross-linked with a polyhydroxylated compound having at least 3 hydroxyl groups, preferably not more than 8, the hydrogen atoms of at least three hydroxyls being replaced by unsaturated aliphatic radicals having at least 2 carbon atoms. The preferred radicals are those containing from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, e.g. vinyls, allyls and other ethylenically unsaturated groups. The unsaturated radicals may themselves contain other substituents, such as methyl. The products sold under the name Carbopol; (BF Goodrich, Ohio, USA) are particularly appropriate. They are cross-linked with an allyl sucrose or with allyl pentaerythritol. Among then, there may be mentioned Carbopol 974P, 934P and 971P. Most preferred is the use of Cabopol 971P. Among the copolymers of maleic anhydride and alkenyl derivative, are the copolymers EMA (Monsanto), which are copolymers of maleic anhydride and ethylene. The dissolution of these polymers in water leads to an acid solution that will be neutralized, preferably to physiological pH, in order to give the adjuvant solution into which the immunogenic, immunological or vaccine composition itself will be incorporated.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0073">Further suitable adjuvants include, but are not limited to, the RIBI adjuvant system (Ribi Inc.), Block co-polymer (CytRx, Atlanta Ga.), SAF-M (Chiron, Emeryville Calif.), monophosphoryl lipid A, Avridine lipid-amine adjuvant, heat-labile enterotoxin from <i>E. coli </i>(recombinant or otherwise), cholera toxin, IMS 1314 or muramyl dipeptide, or naturally occurring or recombinant cytokines or analogs thereof or stimulants of endogenous cytokine release, among many others.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0074">It is expected that an adjuvant can be added in an amount of about 100 Î¼g to about 10 mg per dose, preferably in an amount of about 500 Î¼g to about 5 mg per dose, more preferably in an amount of about 750 Î¼g to about 2.5 mg per dose, and most preferably in an amount of about 1 mg per dose. Alternatively, the adjuvant may be at a concentration of about 0.01 to 50%, preferably at a concentration of about 2% to 30%, more preferably at a concentration of about 5% to 25%, still more preferably at a concentration of about 7% to 22%, and most preferably at a concentration of 10% to 20% by volume of the final product.</p>

      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0076">âIsolatedâ means altered âby the hand of manâ from its natural state, i.e., if it occurs in nature, it has been changed or removed from its original environment, or both. For example, a polynucleotide or polypeptide naturally present in a living organism is not âisolated,â but the same polynucleotide or polypeptide separated from the coexisting materials of its natural state is âisolatedâ, as the term is employed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0077">âSafetyâ refers to the absence of adverse consequences in a vaccinated animal following vaccination, including but not limited to: potential reversion of a live viral-based vaccine to virulence, clinically significant side effects such as persistent, systemic illness or unacceptable inflammation at the site of vaccine administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0078">The terms âvaccinationâ or âvaccinatingâ or variants thereof, as used herein means, but is not limited to, a process which includes the administration of an immunogenic composition of the invention that, when administered to an animal, elicits, or is able to elicitâdirectly or indirectlyâan immune response in the animal against PPV5A.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0079">âMortalityâ, in the context of the present invention, refers to death caused by PPV5A infection, and/or co-infections with other organisms which are potentiated by PPV5A infections, and includes the situation where the infection is so severe that an animal is euthanized to prevent suffering and provide a humane ending to its life.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0080">âAttenuationâ means reducing the virulence of a pathogen. In the present invention âattenuationâ is synonymous with âavirulent.â In the present invention, an attenuated virus is one in which the virulence has been reduced so that it does not cause clinical signs of a PPV5A infection but is capable of inducing an immune response in the target mammal, but may also mean that the clinical signs are reduced in incidence or severity in animals infected with the attenuated PPV5A in comparison with a âcontrol groupâ of animals infected with non-attenuated PPV5A and not receiving the attenuated virus. In this context, the term âreduce/reducedâ means a reduction of at least 10%, preferably 25%, even more preferably 50%, still more preferably 60%, even more preferably 70%, still more preferably 80%, even more preferably 90% and most preferably of 100% as compared to the control group as defined above. Thus, an attenuated, avirulent PPV5A strain is one that suitable for incorporation into an immunogenic composition comprising a modified live PPV5A virus.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0081">âKilledâ or âinactivatedâ means treated with a physical or chemical agent which renders the PPV5A virus dead and/or otherwise incapable of reproduction. PPV5A may be killed by conventional means, such as, for example, heat, radiation or psoralen in the presence of ultraviolet light. PPV5A can be inactivated by conventional means such as, for example, through chemical inactivation using one or more chemical inactivating agents including, but not limited to, one or more of binary ethyleneimine (BEI), beta-propiolactone, formalin, gluteraldehyde, and/or sodium dodecyl sulfate. Methods of attenuating virulent strains of these viruses and methods of making an inactivated viral preparation are known in the art and are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,567,042 and 4,567,043. Antigens from PPV5A for use in the vaccine compositions of the present invention can thus be in the form of a whole virus which is a modified and/or attenuated live viral preparation or a killed or inactivated viral preparation, inter alia.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0082">âAntibodiesâ as used herein includes anti-PPV5A antibodies, e.g., monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, single chain antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanized, human, porcine, and CDR-grafted antibodies, including compounds which include CDR sequences which specifically recognize a PPV5A polypeptide of the invention. The term âspecific forâ indicates that the variable regions of the antibodies of the invention recognize and bind a PPV5A polypeptide exclusively (i.e., are able to distinguish a single PPV5A polypeptide from related polypeptides despite sequence identity, homology, or similarity found in the family of polypeptides), and which are permitted (optionally) to interact with other proteins (for example, <i>S. aureus </i>protein A or other antibodies in ELISA techniques) through interactions with sequences outside the variable region of the antibodies, and in particular, in the constant region of the antibody molecule. Screening assays to determine binding specificity of an antibody of the invention are well known and routinely practiced in the art. For a comprehensive discussion of such assays, see Harlow et al. (Eds), Antibodies A Laboratory Manual: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1988), Chapter 6. Antibodies that recognize and bind fragments of the PPV5A polypeptides of the invention are also contemplated, provided that the antibodies are first and foremost specific for, as defined above, a PPV5A polypeptide of the invention from which the fragment was derived. For the purposes of clarity, âantibodyâ refers to an immunoglobulin molecule that can bind to a specific antigen as the result of an immune response to that antigen. Immunoglobulins are serum proteins composed of âlightâ and âheavyâ polypeptide chains having âconstantâ and âvariableâ regions and are divided into classes (e.g., IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM) based on the composition of the constant regions. Antibodies can exist in a variety of forms including, for example, as, Fv, Fabâ², F(abâ²)2, as well as in single chains, and include synthetic polypeptides that contain all or part of one or more antibody single chain polypeptide sequences.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0083">Herein, âeffective doseâ means, but is not limited to, an amount of antigen that elicits, or is able to elicit, an immune response that yields a reduction of clinical symptoms in an animal to which the antigen is administered.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0084">As used herein, the term âeffective amountâ means, in the context of a composition, an amount of an immunogenic composition capable of inducing an immune response that reduces the incidence of or lessens the severity of infection or incident of disease in an animal. Particularly, an effective amount an attenuated live virus preparation, as measured by the number of plaque forming units (PFU) per dose or equivalent measure, is monitored by the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50), i.e. the amount of a pathogenic agent that will produce pathological change in 50% of inoculated and susceptible cell cultures. For a killed vaccine or antigenic subunit, the effective amount refers to the relative antigen content (RAC), i.e. the inclusion level of antigen per effective dose. Alternatively, in the context of a therapy, the term âeffective amountâ refers to the amount of a therapy which is sufficient to reduce or ameliorate the severity or duration of a disease or disorder, or one or more symptoms thereof, prevent the advancement of a disease or disorder, cause the regression of a disease or disorder, prevent the recurrence, development, onset, or progression of one or more symptoms associated with a disease or disorder, or enhance or improve the prophylaxis or treatment of another therapy or therapeutic agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0085">âSequence identityâ as it is known in the art refers to a relationship between two or more polypeptide sequences or two or more polynucleotide sequences, namely a reference sequence and a given sequence to be compared with the reference sequence. Sequence identity is determined by comparing the given sequence to the reference sequence after the sequences have been optimally aligned to produce the highest degree of sequence similarity, as determined by the match between strings of such sequences, with gaps introduced if necessary. Upon such alignment, sequence identity is ascertained on a position-by-position basis, e.g., the sequences are âidenticalâ at a particular position if at that position, the nucleotides or amino acid residues are identical. The total number of such position identities is then divided by the total number of nucleotides or residues in the reference sequence to give % sequence identity. Sequence identity can be readily calculated by known methods, including but not limited to, those described in Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A. N., ed., Oxford University Press, New York (1988), Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, D. W., ed., Academic Press, New York (1993); Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I, Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds., Humana Press, New Jersey (1994); Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinge, G., Academic Press (1987); Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M. Stockton Press, New York (1991); and Carillo, H., and Lipman, D., SIAM J. Applied Math., 48: 1073 (1988); the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. Preferred methods to determine the sequence identity are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Methods to determine sequence identity are codified in publicly available computer programs which determine sequence identity between given sequences. Examples of such programs include, but are not limited to, the GCG program package (Devereux, J., et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 12(1):387 (1984)), BLASTP, BLASTN and BLASTX (Altschul, S. F. et al., J. Molec. Biol., 215:403-410 (1990). The BLASTX program is publicly available from NCBI and other sources (BLAST Manual, Altschul, S. et al., NCVI NLM NIH Bethesda, Md. 20894, Altschul, S. F. et al., J. Molec. Biol., 215:403-410 (1990), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference). These programs optimally align sequences using default gap weights in order to produce the highest level of sequence identity between the given and reference sequences. As an illustration, by a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence having at least, for example, 85%, preferably 90%, even more preferably 95% âsequence identityâ to a reference nucleotide sequence, it is intended that the nucleotide sequence of the given polynucleotide is identical to the reference sequence except that the given polynucleotide sequence may include up to 15, preferably up to 10, even more preferably up to 5 point mutations per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence. In other words, in a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence having at least 85%, preferably 90%, even more preferably 95% identity relative to the reference nucleotide sequence, up to 15%, preferably 10%, even more preferably 5% of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide, or a number of nucleotides up to 15%, preferably 10%, even more preferably 5% of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These mutations of the reference sequence may occur at the 5â² or 3â² terminal positions of the reference nucleotide sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among nucleotides in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence. Analogously, by a polypeptide having a given amino acid sequence having at least, for example, 85%, preferably 90%, even more preferably 95% sequence identity to a reference amino acid sequence, it is intended that the given amino acid sequence of the polypeptide is identical to the reference sequence except that the given polypeptide sequence may include up to 15, preferably up to 10, even more preferably up to 5 amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the reference amino acid sequence. In other words, to obtain a given polypeptide sequence having at least 85%, preferably 90%, even more preferably 95% sequence identity with a reference amino acid sequence, up to 15%, preferably up to 10%, even more preferably up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another amino acid, or a number of amino acids up to 15%, preferably up to 10%, even more preferably up to 5% of the total number of amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or the carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in the one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence. Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. However, conservative substitutions are not included as a match when determining sequence identity.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0086">âSequence homologyâ as used herein refers to a method of determining the relatedness of two sequences. To determine sequence homology, two or more sequences are optimally aligned, and gaps are introduced if necessary. However, in contrast to âsequence identity,â conservative amino acid substitutions are also counted as a match when determining sequence homology. In other words, to obtain a polypeptide having 95% sequence homology with a reference sequence, 85%, preferably 90%, even more preferably 95% of the amino acid residues in the reference sequence must match or comprise a conservative substitution with another amino acid, or a number of amino acids up to 15%, preferably up to 10%, even more preferably up to 5% of the total amino acid residues, not including conservative substitutions, in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. Preferably the homologous sequence comprises at least a stretch of 50, even more preferred of 100, even more preferred of 250, even more preferred of 500 nucleotides encoding homologous amino acids.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0087">A âconservative substitutionâ refers to the substitution of an amino acid residue with another amino acid residue having similar characteristics or properties including size, hydrophobicity, etc., such that the overall functionality does not change significantly. It can also mean a nucleotide substitution that results in a conservative amino acid substitution.</p>

      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0088">The carrier molecules to which the PPV5A proteins or peptides of the invention can be conjugated or covalently linked are preferably those described above.

      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0089">The PPV5A proteins or peptides of the invention may be covalently coupled to the carrier by any convenient method known to the art. While use of a symmetric linker such as adipic acid dihydrazide, as described by Schneerson et al, J.

Such coupling may be achieved by means of reductive amination as described by Landi et al J. Immunology, 127, 1011-1019 (1981).</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0090">The size of the immunogenic composition, as defined by average molecular weight, is variable and dependent upon the chosen PPV5A protein(s) or peptide(s) and the method of coupling of the PPV5A protein(s) or peptide(s) to the carrier. Therefore, it can be as small as 1,000 daltons (10<sup>3</sup>) or greater than 10<sup>6 </sup>daltons. With the reductive amination coupling method, the molecular weight of the PPV5A protein(s) or peptide(s) is usually within the range of 5,000 to 500,000 or more; e.g., for the capsid protein of SEQ ID NO:4, the molecular weight is predicted to be approximately 80,000 daltons, which is predicted to form virus like particles (VLP) comprised of 60 monomeric proteins.</p>

      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0095">In one aspect, the PPV5A protein or peptide compositions comprise an effective immunizing amount of the immunogenic conjugate, preferably in combination with an immunostimulant; and a physiologically acceptable vehicle. As used in the present context, âimmunostimulantâ is intended to encompass any compound or composition which has the ability to enhance the activity of the immune system, whether it is a specific potentiating effect in combination with a specific antigen, or simply an independent effect upon the activity of one or more elements of the immune response. Immunostimulant compounds include but are not limited to mineral gels, e.g., aluminum hydroxide; surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols; polyanions; peptides; oil emulsions; alum, and MDP. Methods of utilizing these materials are known in the art, and it is well within the ability of the skilled artisan to determine an optimum amount of stimulant for a given vaccine. More than one immunostimulant may be used in a given formulation. The immunogen may also be incorporated into liposomes, or conjugated to polysaccharides and/or other polymers for use in a vaccine formulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0096">The compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack may for example comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration preferably for administration to a mammal, especially a pig.</p>

      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0097">In order to further increase the immunogenicity of the immunogenic compositions provided herewith, and which contain one or more PPV5A proteins or peptides may also comprise one or more adjuvants.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0098">The adjuvant may be purified by any of the techniques described previously or known in the art. The preferred purification technique is silica gel chromatography, in particular the âflashâ (rapid) chromatographic technique, as described by W. Clark Still et al, J. Organic Chemistry, 43, 2923-2925 (1978). However, other chromatographic methods, including HPLC, may be used for purification of the adjuvant. Crystallization may also be used to purify the adjuvant. In some cases, no purification is required as a product of analytical purity is obtained directly from the synthesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0099">The vaccine compositions of the invention are prepared by physically mixing the adjuvant with the PPV5A protein(s) or peptide(s) under appropriate sterile conditions in accordance with known techniques to produce the adjuvanted composition. Complexation of the PPV5A proteins(s) or peptide(s) and the adjuvant is facilitated by the existence of a net negative charge on the conjugate which is electrostatically attracted to the positive charge present on the long chain alkyl compound adjuvant.</p>

      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0100">The vaccine compositions of this invention may be formulated using techniques similar to those used for other pharmaceutical polypeptide compositions. Thus, the adjuvant and PPV5A protein(s) or peptide(s), preferably conjugated to carrier molecule and/or admixed with an adjuvant may be stored in lyophilized form and reconstituted in a physiologically acceptable vehicle to form a suspension prior to administration. Alternatively, the adjuvant and conjugate may be stored in the vehicle. Preferred vehicles are sterile solutions, in particular, sterile buffer solutions, such as phosphate buffered saline. Any method of combining the adjuvant and the conjugate in the vehicle such that improved immunological effectiveness of the immunogenic composition is appropriate.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0101">The volume of a single dose of the vaccine of this invention may vary but will be generally within the ranges commonly employed in conventional vaccines.

The vaccines, comprising the immunogenic conjugate in a physiologically acceptable vehicle, are useful in a method of immunizing animals, preferably swine, for treatment or prevention of infections by PPV5A.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0104">Antibodies generated against immunogenic conjugates of the present invention by immunization with an immunogenic conjugate can be used in passive immunotherapy and generation of antiidiotypic antibodies for treating or preventing infections of PPV5A.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0105">The subject to which the composition is administered is preferably an animal, including but not limited to cows, horses, sheep, pigs, poultry (e.g., chickens), goats, cats, dogs, hamsters, mice and rats; most preferably pigs.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0106">The formulations of the invention comprise an effective immunizing amount of one or more immunogenic compositions or antibodies thereto and a physiologically acceptable vehicle. Vaccines comprise an effective immunizing amount of one or more immunogenic compositions and a physiologically acceptable vehicle. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0107">The immunogenic composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. The immunogenic composition can be a liquid solution, suspension, emulsion, tablet, pill, capsule, sustained release formulation, or powder. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc.</p>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="1">F. EFFECTIVE DOSE</heading>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0108">The compounds described herein can be administered to a subject at therapeutically effective doses to treat PPV5A-associated diseases. The dosage will depend upon the host receiving the vaccine as well as factors such as the size, weight, and age of the host.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0109">The precise amount of immunogenic conjugate or antibody of the invention to be employed in a formulation will depend on the route of administration and the nature of the subject (e.g., species, age, size, stage/level of disease), and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each subject's circumstances according to standard clinical techniques. An effective immunizing amount is that amount sufficient to treat or prevent a PPV5A infectious disease in a subject. Effective doses may also be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from animal model test systems and can vary from 0.1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg, preferably 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0110">Immunogenicity of a composition can be determined by monitoring the immune response of test subjects following immunization with the composition by use of any immunoassay known in the art. Generation of a humoral (antibody) response and/or cell-mediated immunity, may be taken as an indication of an immune response. Test subjects may include animals such as pigs, mice, hamsters, dogs, cats, rabbits, cows, horses, sheep, and poultry (e.g. chickens, ducks, geese, and turkeys).</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0111">The immune response of the test subjects can be analyzed by various approaches such as: the reactivity of the resultant immune serum to the immunogenic conjugate, as assayed by known techniques, e.g., enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblots, immunoprecipitations, etc.; or, by protection of immunized hosts from infection by the pathogen and/or attenuation of symptoms due to infection by the pathogen in immunized hosts as determined by any method known in the art, for assaying the levels of an infectious disease agent, e.g., quantitative PCR, virus isolation or other technique known in the art. The levels of the infectious disease agent may also be determined by measuring the levels of the antigen against which the immunoglobulin was directed. A decrease in the levels of the infectious disease agent or an amelioration of the symptoms of the infectious disease indicates that the composition is effective.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0112">The therapeutics of the invention can be tested in vitro for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to in vivo use in animals. For example, in vitro assays that can be used to determine whether administration of a specific therapeutic is indicated include in vitro cell culture assays in which appropriate cells from a cell line or cells cultured from a subject having a particular disease or disorder are exposed to or otherwise administered a therapeutic, and the effect of the therapeutic on the cells is observed.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0113">Alternatively, the therapeutic may be assayed by contacting the therapeutic to cells (either cultured from a subject or from a cultured cell line) that are susceptible to infection by the infectious disease agent but that are not infected with the infectious disease agent, exposing the cells to the infectious disease agent, and then determining whether the infection rate of cells contacted with the therapeutic was lower than the infection rate of cells not contacted with the therapeutic. Infection of cells with an infectious disease agent may be assayed by any method known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0114">In addition, the therapeutic can be assessed by measuring the level of the molecule against which the antibody is directed in the animal model subject at suitable time intervals before, during, or after therapy. Any change or absence of change in the amount of the molecule can be identified and correlated with the effect of the treatment on the subject. The level of the molecule can be determined by any method known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0115">After vaccination of an animal to a PPV5A using the methods and compositions of the present invention, any binding assay known in the art can be used to assess the binding between the resulting antibody and the particular molecule. These assays may also be performed to select antibodies that exhibit a higher affinity or specificity for the particular antigen.</p>

The clinical history on the farm was of 200 lb pigs with full body muscle tremors which were present upon rest but exaggerated during movement. Following extensive testing at a veterinary diagnostic laboratory which suggested a viral agent (based on microscopic lesions) but only resulted in the identification of Agent X (a non-classical swine fever virus associated pestivirus), samples were provided to the inventors to help determine the underlying cause of the CNS signs in these animals.</p>

      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0132">Resultant sequences were initially characterized by BLASTx analysis as divergent members of the Parvoviridae family. Sequences were assembled using Sequencher software and the results of these DNA analyses coupled with targeted sequencing yielded the DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, which is the putative complete coding sequence of the virus denoted as PPV5A. Further analysis of the DNA sequence using Sequencher software resulted in identification of three putative coding regions corresponding to those found in other parvovirus species, comprising the viral replicase (SEQ ID NO:2), an open reading frame âORF3â (SEQ ID NO:3) and the viral capsid protein (SEQ ID NO:4).</p>

BLASTn and BLASTx analysis revealed the closest identity to porcine parvovirus 4, with a maximum of 67% nucleotide identity in conserved regions of the replicase gene (REP), while the capsid (CAP) coding regions did not exhibit a discernable match at the nucleotide level. At the protein level, the putative replicase protein exhibited Ë60% amino acid identity and Ë50% identity in the capsid protein. The virus was denoted as a new species, porcine parvovirus 5A (PPV5A). Specific primers were developed based on the capsid coding sequence and PCR based screening of homogenates that were similar in tissue and pathological/clinical characteristics revealed presence of the agent in Ë16% of samples.

In this study, there were an unexpected, high number of mortalities (20-22%) in groups inoculated with the tissue homogenate containing the novel parvoviruses and high titers of PPV5A were identified in serum using PPV5A-specific PCR targeting the capsid coding region. Tissues from one animal in this study were then used to challenge CDCD pigs to reproduce clinical signs. In this study, a systemic infection with high titers of viremia was noted in the majority of infected animals.

      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0154">The HIS-tagged bacterially expressed capsid protein prepared in accordance with Example 7 was used to immunize two New Zealand White rabbits at a custom antibody production service (Rockland Antibodies and Assays; Gilbertsville, Pa.). Rabbits were immunized with approximately 100 Î¼g antigen/rabbit at D0, D7, D14 and D28. For D0 and D7 inoculation, animals were inoculated intradermally; inoculations given at D14 and 28 were administered subcutaneously. Complete Freund's adjuvant was used in the first inoculation; incomplete Freud's adjuvant was used in subsequent inoculations. Serum samples from both rabbits were collected before immunization and at 38 and 45 days post immunization.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0155">Polyclonal antibody preparations were screened for anti-PPV5A specificity by Rockland Antibodies and Assays. Antibodies were produced having binding specificity to purified or partially purified PPV5A protein by immunofluorescent assay (IFA), western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Parameters for specificity of each assay were as follows: western blot specificity were measured by detection of the predicted 88.8 kDa sized protein, IFA specificity measured by comparison to uninfected cells, and ELISA specificity by coating plate with non-relevant protein.</p>

      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0157">HIS-tagged baculovirus expressed capsid protein prepared in accordance with Example 7 are used to generate monoclonal antibodies in Balb/c mice at a custom antibody production service (Rockland Antibodies and Assays; Gilbertsville, Pa.). Mice are immunized with various PPV5A antigenic preparations according to standard protocols designed by the custom antibody production facility. The immune response following inoculation is monitored by the custom antibody production facility and antibody candidates are selected for generation of hybridomas. Standard protocols for generation of monoclonal antibodies are well known to those in the art, e.g. as disclosed in Gabriele et al. (9), p. 117-135.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0158">Hybridomas are generated by combining B-cell tumor cells cultivated in hybridoma medium to the proliferation phase with spleen cells harvested from inoculated mice determined to produce antibodies to PPVSA antigens according to standard protocols, as disclosed in Gabriele et al. (9), p. 117-135. After fusion and culturing the hybridomas, the hybridomas are screened for binding to PPVSA antigens, and anti-PPVSA producing hybridomas are selected. Monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridomas are purified using affinity chromatography according to standard protocols, as disclosed in Gabriele et al. (9), p. 209-232.</p>

      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0165">To evaluate the efficacy of the composition of matter that comprises at least one PPV5A protein or polypeptide (prototype PPV5A vaccine) in pigs, a randomized study using five week old colostrum-deprived-cesarean-derived (CDCD) animals randomized into three groups (see Table 2) is performed. Animals are vaccinated with a composition or a placebo (phosphate buffered saline; PBS) at study day 0 (D0) and D14. Animals are challenged on D28 with material known to contain PPV5A. Clinical observations, rectal temperatures, weight measurements and blood collection are monitored. At D56, animals are necropsied to evaluate macroscopic lesions. The efficacy of the PPV5A vaccine is determined by statistically comparing the percent mortality, viremia (titers and duration), seroconversion (titers and duration) and clinical signs between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals.</p>
