      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for suppressing fires. In particular, the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for suppressing fires associated with containers.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Cargo may be transported to its destination using one or more of several different types of vehicles, including, for example, ships, trains, aircraft, and trucks. Such cargo is transported while located in the interior of cargo areas. In some cases, cargo may include hazardous, easily flammable, and/or easily combustible materials that may render transport dangerous to the cargo itself, as well as to the vehicle transporting the cargo and operators of the vehicle.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In many instances, cargo may be carried in an area separated from an operator controlling the vehicle. As a result, an operator may be unaware of a fire or explosion that has occurred within a cargo container or within the cargo area. Moreover, due to the nature of a cargo vehicle, there may be a limited supply of fire suppressant available. For example, aboard a cargo aircraft, the weight of any fire suppressant may limit the amount of fire suppressant that may be carried for suppressing fires. Therefore, it may be desirable to limit the amount of fire suppressant used to extinguish a fire in order to reduce the weight carried by the aircraft by focusing any release of fire suppressant on the particular area in need of fire suppressant, rather than merely releasing a large enough amount of suppressant to flood the entire cargo area. Furthermore, the fire suppressant itself may be harmful to some types of cargo. Therefore, it may be desirable to limit the release of fire suppressant to the location in need of fire suppression, so as to limit the spoilage of cargo not in need of fire suppressant.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Because cargo areas experiencing a fire may be located remotely from cargo vehicle operators (i.e., the cargo may be located in an unoccupied and/or difficult to access portion of the vehicle), it may be more difficult to provide fire suppressant to an area experiencing a fire in a timely manner. Therefore, it may be desirable to provide a system for supplying fire suppressant remotely and in a timely manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">One example of a cargo vehicle having an operator located relatively remotely from the cargo area is an aircraft. The majority of cargo carried by modern aircraft is transported in cargo containers or on cargo pallets. The containers are generally referred to generically as Unit Load Devices (“ULDs”). For safety considerations, ULDs must often be configured to engage an aircraft cargo locking system in order to restrain the cargo containers under various flight, ground load, and/or emergency conditions. Under federal air regulations, ULDs are considered aircraft appliances, are Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-certified for a specific type of aircraft, and are typically manufactured to specifications contained in National Aerospace Standard (NAS) 3610.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In the cargo aircraft example, while some cargo areas may be conventionally equipped with fire extinguishing bottles intended for manual operation, few cargo containers may be accessible to flight crews during a flight, thereby possibly rendering it difficult to manually extinguish a fire located in an aircraft cargo area using fire extinguishing bottles. In addition, fires may occur inside cargo containers, and if those fires are not suppressed or extinguished, they may breach the walls of the container and spread throughout the cargo area. However, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to suppress or extinguish a fire inside a container without discharging fire suppressant into the interior of the container.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Thus, it may be desirable to provide a system for suppressing a fire associated with a container for which a fire has been detected. In addition, it may be desirable to provide a system for supplying fire suppressant inside the container. Further, it may be desirable to provide a system for supplying a fire suppressant inside the container for an extended period of time or duration of time, for example, so that a cargo aircraft may safely land before a fire spreads throughout the cargo area.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Such a fire suppression system or plurality of systems may be located either in one area of a cargo area, such as a “high risk” area containing particularly hazardous materials, or throughout the cargo area.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Problems associated with detecting and/or suppressing fires are not limited to the cargo transportation industry. Similar problems may arise, for example, wherever cargo and/or other articles are stored in a location that is remote from a person supervising the cargo or other articles, such as in a storage facility. Thus, in a broad variety of situations, it may be desirable to remotely detect and/or remotely suppress a fire.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In many applications, it may be impractical or inefficient to store a fire suppression system directly in a container such as a ULD. For instance, containers may be subjected to harsh environments, including extreme cold and heat, shock, vibration, and general abuse. As a result, providing a fire suppression system in each individual container may be impractical due, for example, to accelerated degradation or failure of such systems over time. Moreover, a given company in the cargo freight industry may use thousands of containers, and the cost of equipping each container with a fire suppression system may be prohibitive. Installing, maintaining, and removing the fire suppression system of each container could also be impractical and uneconomical. As a result, there are many possible drawbacks to providing fire suppressing systems in a large number of containers.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In addition, existing technologies and techniques may only provide a limited fire suppressing window. For example, some methods may be a one-time solution, such as devices that supply a fire suppressing agent into a container during a single application. When a fire suppressing agent leaks out of or disperses from a ULD after introduction into the ULD, the fire may grow again and breach the ULD, potentially spreading to surrounding cargo. This may severely limit the time available for a flight crew to safely land a cargo aircraft, for example. Some tests have shown that a single application of fire suppressing agent into a container may be effective for twenty minutes or less. This may be inadequate, for example, for a cargo aircraft during a transoceanic flight, where it may take several hours to fly to the closest airport suitable for landing. Therefore, it may be desirable to provide a consistent or repeated supply of fire suppressing agent to a container over an extended duration.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In the following description, certain aspects and embodiments of a device for supplying fire suppressing agent to the interior of a container for an extended duration will become evident. It should be understood that the aspects and embodiments, in their broadest sense, could be practiced without having one or more features of these aspects and embodiments. It should be understood that these aspects and embodiments are merely exemplary.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">One aspect of the disclosure relates to a device for supplying fire suppressing agent to the interior of a container for an extended duration. The device may include a plurality of chambers configured to contain and selectively expel fire suppressing agent, a puncture mechanism configured to puncture a container, and a manifold in flow communication with the plurality of chambers and the puncture mechanism. The device may further include a controller configured to initiate expulsion of the fire suppressing agent from the chambers in a controlled manner. The device may be configured such that the fire suppressing agent may be first expelled from a first one of the plurality of chambers at a first time, and the fire suppressing agent may be expelled from a second one of the plurality of chambers at a second time that is later than the first time.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">As used herein, the term “fire” is not necessarily limited to a fire having visible flames. Rather, the term “fire” is used in a broad sense and may be used to describe situations in which an object and/or surface is exhibiting a higher temperature than desired or considered to be unsafe to a person having skill in the art, such as, for example, a situation in which an object and/or surface is smoldering, smoking, and/or is hot to the touch.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">According to another aspect, a system for supplying fire suppressing agent to the interior of a container for an extended duration may include a plurality of chambers configured to contain and selectively expel fire suppressing agent, a puncture mechanism configured to puncture a container, and a manifold in flow communication with the plurality of chambers and the puncture mechanism. The system may further include a sensor configured to provide signals indicative of a temperature associated with a container to a controller configured to initiate expulsion of fire suppressing agent from the chambers in a controlled manner. The system may be configured such that the fire suppressing agent may be first expelled from a first one of the plurality of chambers at a first time, and the fire suppressing agent may be expelled from a second one of the plurality of chambers at a second time that is later than the first time. The puncture mechanism may be configured to extend and puncture a container after expulsion of the fire suppressing agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">According to a further aspect, a method for supplying fire suppressing agent to the interior of a container for an extended duration may include detecting sensor signals indicative of a temperature associated with a container, determining via a controller that the fire suppressing agent should be supplied to the interior of the container based at least in part on the sensor signals, and initiating via the controller expulsion of fire suppressing agent from a chamber containing fire suppressing agent. The method may further include puncturing a surface of the container with a puncture mechanism to provide flow communication between the chamber and the interior of the container to permit supply of fire suppressing agent into the interior of the container at a first time. The method may further include initiating, via the controller, expulsion of fire suppressing agent from a second chamber containing fire suppressing agent at a second time after the first time. The method may further include supplying fire suppressing agent from the second chamber into the interior of the container.</p>

      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments, which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows an exemplary vehicle <b>10</b> for transporting containers. The vehicle <b>10</b> may include a body <b>12</b> defining an interior <b>14</b> of the vehicle, a deck <b>16</b> within the body <b>14</b>, the deck <b>16</b> being configured to support a plurality of containers <b>18</b>, and a ceiling <b>20</b> spaced above the deck <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the exemplary vehicle <b>10</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The vehicle <b>10</b> may include a system <b>22</b> for supplying fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> (see <figref>FIG. 3</figref>) to the interior of a container <b>18</b> supported by the deck <b>16</b>. The system <b>22</b> may be attached, for example, to the ceiling <b>20</b> above at least one location configured to receive a container <b>18</b>. The system <b>22</b> may include a sensor <b>24</b> and a controller <b>26</b>. The system <b>22</b> may further include at least two chambers <b>30</b> containing a fire suppressing agent <b>32</b>, a puncture mechanism <b>34</b> with a conveyance tube <b>36</b> and a puncture tip <b>38</b> (see <figref>FIG. 5</figref>), and a manifold <b>40</b> connecting the chambers <b>30</b> to the puncture mechanism <b>34</b> that allows for flow of the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> from a chamber <b>30</b> to the puncture mechanism <b>34</b> during operation of the system <b>22</b>. In the exemplary embodiment shown, each chamber <b>30</b> is coupled to the manifold <b>40</b>, for example, via a threaded screw connection <b>42</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> may include any suitable substance or combination of substances. For example, the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> may include, for example, a pyro-propellant configured to both generate driving pressure and provide a fire extinguishing or fire suppressing gas or aerosol. For example, the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> may include one or more of sodium azide, 5-amino tetrazole, potassium 5-amino tetrazole, guanidine nitrate, potassium chlorate, potassium nitrate, potassium perchlorate, strontium nitrate, copper nitrate (basic), copper oxide (black), ammonium perchlorate, or a LOVA propellant. Other substances having similar characteristics are contemplated for use as the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b>. Additionally, the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> may employ byproducts of chemical reactions, such as, for example, producing potassium carbonate through a combustion reaction in the form of a finely-dispersed, micro-pulverized aerosol.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the chambers <b>30</b> are arranged about the manifold <b>40</b> in a circumferential manner. The system <b>22</b> may be configured such that only a single chamber <b>30</b> discharges a fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> into the manifold <b>40</b> at a given time. The controller <b>26</b> may be configured to control ignition of the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> within each chamber <b>30</b> according to an ignition schedule, such that fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> may be supplied to a container <b>18</b> over an extended duration by releasing the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> from a plurality of the chambers <b>30</b> at spaced time intervals. The activation rate of each chamber <b>30</b> and/or the discharge rate of fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> from each chamber <b>30</b> may be controlled by the controller <b>26</b>. For example, the controller <b>26</b> may include a timer using fixed time intervals, a sensory input-based program, or any other suitable time-regulating mechanism.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The sensor <b>24</b> may be configured to detect undesirably high temperatures, such as from a fire within a container <b>18</b>. The sensor <b>24</b> may be any suitable fire-detection mechanism, such as a thermal sensor, a smoke detector, or thermally sensitive materials. In some embodiments, the sensor <b>24</b> is in communication with the controller <b>26</b>, for example, via hard-wiring and/or a wireless communication link. In the event that the sensor <b>24</b> detects a fire, such as through an elevated temperature reading or by detecting smoke, the sensor <b>24</b> is configured to send a signal detectable by the controller <b>26</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The controller <b>26</b> may include one or more processors, microprocessors, central processing units, on-board computers, electronic control modules, and/or any other computing and control devices known to those skilled in the art. The controller <b>26</b> may be configured to run one or more software programs or applications stored in a memory location, read from a computer-readable medium, and/or accessed from an external device operatively coupled to the controller <b>26</b> by any suitable communications network.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">After receiving the signal from the sensor <b>24</b>, the controller <b>26</b> may use any suitable means, such as software programming, mechanical components, or chemical reactions, to initiate operation of the system <b>22</b>. Initiating operation may be accomplished, for example, via sending an activation signal to an igniter <b>44</b> located within a chamber <b>30</b> containing the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b>, for example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. When exposed to heat from the igniter <b>44</b>, the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> may undergo a chemical reaction, rapidly expanding and increasing pressure within the chamber <b>30</b>. According to some embodiments, following activation of the igniter <b>44</b>, the controller <b>26</b> sends a signal to a reporting unit (not shown) notifying a user that the system is operating, such as to a remote flight crew within an aircraft cockpit. It is contemplated that other mechanisms and methods may be used to trigger release of fire suppressing agent <b>32</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> shows an exemplary system <b>22</b> immediately following activation. Following activation of the igniter <b>44</b>, which may provide, for example, an igniter flame <b>45</b> in the chamber, the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> heats and expands within the chamber <b>30</b>. One or more pressure control plugs <b>46</b> located in a passage <b>48</b> between the chamber <b>30</b> and the manifold <b>40</b> may be displaced, dislodged, or otherwise removed by pressure from the expanding fire suppressing agent <b>32</b>. (To illustrate the presence and flow of the expanding fire suppressing agent <b>32</b>, a darker shade is used in <figref>FIGS. 5-7</figref> for the activated fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> than for unactivated fire suppressing agent <b>33</b> in an unactivated chamber <b>30</b>). The pressure control plug <b>46</b> may be formed from any suitable material as long as it prevents external pressure and heat from affecting an inactive chamber <b>30</b> (i.e., while the system is not activated). As shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, once a pressure control plug <b>46</b> is dislodged, the chamber <b>30</b> may be placed in flow communication with the manifold <b>40</b>, and the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> may flow out of the chamber <b>30</b> and into the manifold <b>40</b>. The fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> may continue to expand while pressurizing the interior space of the manifold <b>40</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> shows the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> as it expands within the manifold <b>40</b>, further exerting force upon a pressure disk <b>50</b> located at the interface between the manifold <b>40</b> and the puncture mechanism <b>34</b>. (Arrows are used in <figref>FIGS. 6-8</figref> to schematically indicate the flow of the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b>.) The force exerted upon the pressure disk <b>50</b> may cause the puncture tip <b>38</b>, initially located in a retracted position within a conveyance tube <b>36</b> of the puncture mechanism <b>34</b>, to extend along the conveyance tube <b>36</b>. The puncture tip <b>38</b> may include an angled piercing edge <b>39</b>, a puncture tip opening <b>41</b>, and a puncture tip side port <b>71</b>. The puncture tip <b>38</b> may extend to a certain point, such as until the puncture tip <b>38</b> reaches one or more guide stops (not shown) on the conveyance tube <b>36</b>. When the puncture tip <b>38</b> strikes the container <b>18</b>, pressure may continue to build up on the pressure disk <b>50</b> as a result of the expanding fire suppressing agent <b>32</b>, which may increase the force upon the puncture tip <b>38</b> through the pressure disk <b>50</b>, thereby causing the puncture tip <b>38</b> to penetrate an exterior wall of a container <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In some embodiments, the conveyance tube <b>36</b> further includes a locking mechanism (not shown) that locks the puncture tip <b>38</b> at its furthest-traveled position, thereby preventing the puncture tip <b>38</b> from contacting an object and bouncing back into the conveyance tube <b>36</b>. The locking mechanism maximizes the likelihood of successful container <b>18</b> penetration, minimizing the possible waste of fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> during operation of the system <b>22</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, as the puncture tip <b>38</b> translates along the extent of the conveyance tube <b>36</b>, but before the puncture tip <b>38</b> reaches its maximum extension, a pressure plug <b>52</b> located on the pressure disk <b>50</b> may be displaced by a pressure plug cable <b>54</b> fastened to the interior of the manifold <b>40</b>. Displacement of the pressure plug <b>52</b> exposes an orifice <b>56</b> within the pressure disk <b>50</b> that allows the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> to flow from the manifold <b>40</b> to the conveyance tube <b>36</b> through the orifice <b>56</b>. The puncture tip <b>38</b> penetrates the skin of a container <b>18</b> before the pressure plug <b>52</b> is displaced from the pressure disk <b>50</b>, thereby allowing the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> to flow through the conveyance tube <b>36</b> and into the interior of the container <b>18</b> through the puncture tip opening <b>41</b> and/or the puncture tip side port <b>71</b>. (The flow of fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> through the conveyance tube <b>36</b> is shown with schematic arrows in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, the pressure plug cable <b>54</b> may be initially coiled within a pressure plug cable sleeve <b>58</b> located within the manifold <b>40</b>. The pressure plug cable sleeve <b>58</b> protects the pressure plug cable <b>54</b> from damage or deformation during the initial expansion of the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> within the manifold <b>40</b>. The pressure plug <b>52</b> is displaced by the pressure plug cable <b>54</b> when the pressure plug cable <b>54</b> reaches its full extension, such as when the puncture tip <b>38</b> translates within the conveyance tube <b>36</b> away from the manifold <b>40</b> to a certain distance from the manifold <b>40</b>. An exemplary embodiment of a fully-extended pressure plug cable <b>54</b> attached to a pressure plug <b>52</b> is shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>. The pressure plug cable <b>54</b> may be made of any suitable material, such as stainless steel or other materials having similar characteristics. Collectively, the pressure plug <b>52</b>, pressure plug cable <b>54</b>, and pressure plug cable sleeve <b>58</b> form a pressure plug assembly <b>59</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Pressure may mount within the manifold <b>40</b> and/or chamber <b>30</b> if the puncture tip <b>38</b> does not translate far enough within the conveyance tube <b>36</b> to displace the pressure plug <b>52</b> from the pressure disk <b>50</b> via the pressure plug cable <b>54</b>. To alleviate such pressure before it causes damage to the manifold <b>40</b> and/or chamber <b>30</b>, the pressure disk <b>50</b> may further include an emergency pressure release valve <b>60</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In the exemplary embodiments shown in <figref>FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, the emergency pressure release valve <b>60</b> on the pressure disk <b>50</b> may include a pressure plate <b>62</b>, springs <b>64</b>, and ports <b>66</b>. The ports <b>66</b> of the emergency pressure valve <b>60</b> may allow the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> to bypass the orifice <b>56</b> that would otherwise be exposed by displacement of the pressure plug <b>52</b>, and the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b>, through the ports <b>66</b>, may then exert pressure upon the pressure plate <b>62</b>. In the exemplary embodiments shown, the pressure plate <b>62</b> is connected to the pressure disk <b>50</b> by springs <b>64</b>, and includes a pressure plate orifice <b>68</b> in the center of the pressure plate <b>62</b> configured to allow the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> to flow through the pressure plate <b>62</b> without impediment upon removal of the pressure plug <b>52</b> by the pressure plug cable <b>54</b>. The pressure plate <b>62</b> may block the flow of any fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> traveling through the ports <b>66</b> if the pressure plug <b>52</b> remains in place, however, until the pressure from the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> in the ports <b>66</b> directed against the pressure plate <b>62</b> exerts sufficient force to displace the pressure plate <b>52</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The strength of the springs <b>64</b>, which dictates the force required for displacement of the pressure plate <b>62</b>, may be determined, for example, by considering the critical system pressure and a factor of safety, and may be selected to permit the pressure plate <b>62</b> to separate from the pressure disk <b>50</b> prior to any pressure damage occurring to the manifold <b>40</b> or chambers <b>30</b>. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, when the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> within the manifold <b>40</b> exerts sufficient pressure against the pressure plate <b>62</b> and stretches the springs <b>64</b>, thereby displacing the pressure plate <b>62</b>, the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> enters the conveyance tube <b>36</b> through the pressure plate orifice <b>68</b>, even if the puncture tip <b>38</b> is not fully extended. (The flow of the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> is schematically shown with arrows). The use of springs <b>64</b> is exemplary, and the pressure plate <b>62</b> may be displaced by alternative mechanisms, such as valves or electrical pressure transducers (not shown).</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In the exemplary embodiments shown in <figref>FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, the puncture mechanism <b>34</b> may further include a puncture tip disconnect <b>70</b> that allows for easy removal of the puncture tip <b>38</b> from the conveyance tube <b>36</b> after operation of the system <b>22</b>. The puncture tip disconnect <b>70</b> may allow the puncture tip <b>38</b>, for example, to remain in the container <b>18</b> following penetration of the container <b>18</b> until the puncture tip <b>38</b> can be safely removed during inspection.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The system <b>22</b> may further include a heat sink <b>72</b> configured to cool the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> after ignition and before the fire suppressing agent <b>32</b> enters one or more of the manifold <b>40</b>, puncture mechanism <b>34</b>, and container <b>18</b>. The heat sink <b>72</b> may be formed from any suitable material in an arrangement with high surface area and high thermal conductivity, such as, for example, a series of baffles or an array of fins. The heat sink <b>72</b> may be provided in one or more of the chamber <b>30</b>, manifold <b>40</b>, or conveyance tube <b>36</b>.</p>
