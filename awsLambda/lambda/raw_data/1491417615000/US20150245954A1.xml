      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to methods and apparatuses for making absorbent articles with absorbent structures, and more particularly, sensing distortions in patterns of reflected light to create profiles representing surface topographies of absorbent structures during the manufacture of absorbent articles.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Along an assembly line, various types of articles, such as for example, diapers and other absorbent articles, may be assembled by adding components to and/or otherwise modifying an advancing, continuous web of material. For example, in some processes, advancing webs of material are combined with other advancing webs of material. In other examples, individual components created from advancing webs of material are combined with advancing webs of material, which in turn, are then combined with other advancing webs of material. In some cases, individual components created from advancing web or webs are combined with other individual components created from other advancing web or webs. Webs of material and component parts used to manufacture diapers may include: backsheets, topsheets, leg cuffs, waist bands, acquisition layers, absorbent core components, front and/or back ears, fastening components, and various types of elastic webs and components such as leg elastics, barrier leg cuff elastics, stretch side panels, and waist elastics. Once the desired component parts are assembled, the advancing web(s) and component parts are subjected to a final knife cut to separate the web(s) into discrete diapers or other absorbent articles.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In some configurations, absorbent articles may include absorbent structures positioned between the topsheets and backsheets. In addition, absorbent structures may include acquisition layers and absorbent cores, wherein the acquisition layers may be positioned between the absorbent cores and topsheets. As such, the topsheets, backsheets, and absorbent structures of such absorbent articles may function to absorb and/or contain the discharged materials and also to isolate bodily exudates from the wearer's skin and from the wearer's garments and bed clothing. For quality control purposes, absorbent article manufacturing lines may utilize various types of sensor technology to detect various types of characteristics of webs and discrete components added to the webs along the converting line as absorbent articles are constructed. Example sensor technology may include vision systems, photoelectric sensors, proximity sensors, laser or sonic distance detectors, and the like. In turn, sensor data may be communicated to a controller in various ways. In some configurations, the controller may be programmed to utilize sensor data to make operational adjustments; communicate converting line operating information; and/or reject defective diapers.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Although the previously mentioned sensor technology may be configured to provide information about the presence or absence of various components as well as relative positions and/or perimeter shapes of such components, such sensor technology may not be configured to provide desired information about absorbent structures. Absorbent structures may be constructed in various ways in an attempt to improve wearer fit and comfort and/or the manner in which absorbent structures absorb and/or transport liquid discharged onto and through a topsheet. For example, the absorbent structures may be constructed in various shapes and/or with varying amounts of absorbent material arranged along a width and/or length. In some instances, absorbent cores may be constructed with regions having no absorbent material or relatively small amounts of absorbent material. Such regions may provide improved core bending flexibility in use. In addition, some acquisition layers may be constructed with varying thicknesses along the length and/or width. For example, some absorbent structures may be configured with acquisition layers having relatively thicker regions located within absorbent articles in positions relatively near where discharges of liquid from a wearer is relatively more likely to occur. In efforts to improve and control quality of manufactured absorbent articles, it may be desirable to obtain additional detailed information about the construction of such absorbent cores and/or acquisition layers during the assembly process. Consequently, it would be beneficial to obtain information about the surface topography and/or thicknesses of absorbent cores and/or acquisition layers during the assembly process.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The present disclosure relates to methods and apparatuses for sensing distortions in patterns of reflected light to create profiles representing surface topographies of absorbent structures during the manufacture of absorbent articles. Aspects of the present disclosure relate to the fabrication of absorbent articles wherein an inspection system may be configured to interact with, monitor, and/or control a converting line. The inspection system may include sensors arranged adjacent an advancing absorbent structure on a converting line and may communicate with a controller.

      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The present disclosure relates to methods and apparatuses for making absorbent articles with absorbent structures, and in particular, sensing distortions in patterns of reflected light to create profiles representing surface topographies of absorbent structures during the manufacture of absorbent articles. As discussed in more detail below, absorbent articles, such as diapers may have absorbent structures that include a liquid acquisition layer and a substantially cellulose free absorbent core disposed between a topsheet and a backsheet. Aspects of the methods according to the present disclosure relate to the fabrication of absorbent articles wherein an inspection system may be configured to interact with, monitor, and/or control the converting line. The inspection system may include sensors arranged adjacent an advancing absorbent structure on a converting line and may communicate with the controller. Based on such communications, the controller may monitor and affect various operations on the converting line. The inspection systems herein may also include a radiation source that illuminates a surface of an absorbent structure with a predetermined pattern of light extending in the cross direction CD. The sensor may include a lens adapted to receive light reflected from the absorbent structure. In turn, the sensor senses distortions in patterns of light reflected from the illuminated surface of the absorbent structure and triangulates changes in elevation of the illuminated surface of the absorbent structure relative to the sensor. Based on the triangulated changes in elevation, the sensor creates a profile representing a surface topography of the illuminated surface of the absorbent structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The following provides a general description of various types of absorbent articles that may be produced with the methods and apparatuses disclosed herein to help provide additional context to the subsequent discussion of the process embodiments.</p>

The respective grid patterns <b>92</b> may be offset such that the absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b> is substantially continuously distributed across the absorbent particulate polymer area <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b> may be substantially continuously distributed across the absorbent particulate polymer material area <b>114</b> despite the individual grid patterns <b>92</b> comprising absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b> discontinuously distributed across the first and second substrates <b>64</b> and <b>72</b> in clusters <b>90</b>.

      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">In some embodiments, such as shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, the amount of absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b> may vary along the length <b>116</b> of the grid pattern <b>92</b>. The grid pattern may be divided into absorbent zones <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>, in which the amount of absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b> varies from zone to zone. As used herein, âabsorbent zoneâ refers to a region of the absorbent particulate polymer material area having boundaries that are perpendicular to the longitudinal axis shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>. The amount of absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b> may, in a certain embodiment, gradually transition from one of the plurality of absorbent zones <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> to another.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The amount of absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b> present in the absorbent core <b>14</b> may vary, but in certain embodiments, is present in the absorbent core in an amount greater than about 80% by weight of the absorbent core, or greater than about 85% by weight of the absorbent core, or greater than about 90% by weight of the absorbent core, or greater than about 95% by weight of the core. In some embodiments, the absorbent core <b>14</b> consists essentially of the first and second substrates <b>64</b> and <b>72</b>, the absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b>, and the thermoplastic adhesive composition <b>68</b> and <b>76</b>. In some embodiments, the absorbent core <b>14</b> may be substantially cellulose free.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The absorbent particulate polymer material area may have a relatively narrow width in the crotch area of the absorbent article for increased wearing comfort.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">It some absorbent articles, such as diapers, liquid discharge from the wearer may occur predominately in the front half of the diaper. The front half of the absorbent core <b>14</b> may therefore comprise most of the absorbent capacity of the core. Thus, according to certain embodiments, the front half of said absorbent core <b>14</b> may comprise more than about 60% of the superabsorbent material, or more than about 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, or 90% of the superabsorbent material.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">In certain embodiments, the absorbent core <b>14</b> may further comprise any absorbent material that is generally compressible, conformable, non-irritating to the wearer's skin, and capable of absorbing and retaining liquids such as urine and other certain body exudates. In such embodiments, the absorbent core <b>14</b> may comprise a wide variety of liquid-absorbent materials commonly used in disposable diapers and other absorbent articles such as comminuted wood pulp, which is generally referred to as airfelt, creped cellulose wadding, melt blown polymers, including co-form, chemically stiffened, modified or cross-linked cellulosic fibers, tissue, including tissue wraps and tissue laminates, absorbent foams, absorbent sponges, or any other known absorbent material or combinations of materials. The absorbent core <b>14</b> may further comprise minor amounts (typically less than about 10%) of materials, such as adhesives, waxes, oils and the like. Exemplary absorbent structures for use as the absorbent assemblies are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,610,678; 4,834,735; 4,888,231; 5,260,345; 5,387,207; and 5,397,316.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">The thermoplastic adhesive material <b>68</b> and <b>76</b> may cover and at least partially immobilize the absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b>. In some embodiments, the thermoplastic adhesive material <b>68</b> and <b>76</b> can be disposed essentially uniformly within the absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b>, between the polymers. In some embodiments, the thermoplastic adhesive material <b>68</b> and <b>76</b> may be provided as a fibrous layer which is at least partially in contact with the absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b> and partially in contact with the substrate layers <b>64</b> and <b>72</b> of the first and second absorbent layers <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>. <figref>FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>7</b> show such a structure wherein the absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b> is provided as a discontinuous layer, and a layer of fibrous thermoplastic adhesive material <b>68</b> and <b>76</b> is laid down onto the layer of absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b>, such that the thermoplastic adhesive material <b>68</b> and <b>76</b> is in direct contact with the absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b>, but also in direct contact with the second surfaces <b>80</b> and <b>84</b> of the substrates <b>64</b> and <b>72</b>, where the substrates are not covered by the absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b>. This imparts an essentially three-dimensional structure to the fibrous layer of thermoplastic adhesive material <b>68</b> and <b>76</b>, which in itself is essentially a two-dimensional structure of relatively small thickness, as compared to the dimension in length and width directions. In other words, the thermoplastic adhesive material <b>68</b> and <b>76</b> undulates between the absorbent particulate polymer material <b>68</b> and <b>76</b> and the second surfaces of the substrates <b>64</b> and <b>72</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">Thereby, the thermoplastic adhesive material <b>68</b> and <b>76</b> may provide cavities to cover the absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b>, and thereby immobilizes this material. In a further aspect, the thermoplastic adhesive material <b>68</b> and <b>76</b> bonds to the substrates <b>64</b> and <b>72</b> and thus affixes the absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b> to the substrates <b>64</b> and <b>72</b>. Thus, in accordance with certain embodiments, the thermoplastic adhesive material <b>68</b> and <b>76</b> immobilizes the absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b> when wet. Some thermoplastic adhesive materials will also penetrate into both the absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b> and the substrates <b>64</b> and <b>72</b>, thus providing for further immobilization and affixation. Of course, while the thermoplastic adhesive materials disclosed herein provide a much improved wet immobilization (i.e., immobilization of absorbent material when the article is wet or at least partially loaded), these thermoplastic adhesive materials may also provide a very good immobilization of absorbent material when the absorbent core <b>14</b> is dry. The thermoplastic adhesive material <b>68</b> and <b>76</b> may also be referred to as a hot melt adhesive.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">The absorbent core <b>14</b> may also include an auxiliary adhesive <b>137</b> which is discussed in more detail below with reference to <figref>FIG. 11</figref>.

The auxiliary adhesive <b>137</b> may also aid in immobilizing the absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b> and <b>74</b> and may comprise the same thermoplastic adhesive material as described hereinabove or may also comprise other adhesives including but not limited to sprayable hot melt adhesives, such as H.B. Fuller Co. (St. Paul, Minn.) Product No. HL-1620-B. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, the absorbent core <b>14</b> may also be configured with one or more channel regions <b>115</b>. In some embodiments, the channel regions <b>115</b> may be regions of the absorbent core <b>14</b> that are substantially free of absorbent particulate polymer material <b>66</b>, <b>74</b> surround by absorbent particulate polymer material areas <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, the substrates <b>64</b>, <b>72</b> may be bonded with directly each other in the channel regions <b>115</b>. In some embodiments, the channel regions <b>115</b> may have a first thickness T<b>1</b> surrounded by absorbent particulate polymer material areas <b>114</b> having a second thickness T<b>2</b>, wherein first thickness T<b>1</b> is less than the second thickness T<b>2</b>. It is to be appreciated that the absorbent core <b>14</b> may include various quantities of channel regions <b>115</b> having various shapes, widths, and/or lengths. It is to be appreciated that the acquisition system <b>50</b> may also include channels that may or not correspond with the channels <b>115</b> in the absorbent core <b>14</b>.

As such, the method of operation of the converting apparatus <b>300</b> may described with reference to the various components of diapers <b>10</b> described above and shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-10</figref>. As described in more detail below, the converting apparatus <b>300</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref> operates to advance a continuous topsheet web <b>18</b> in a machine direction. A liquid acquisition layer <b>50</b> and an absorbent core <b>14</b> are combined with the advancing topsheet web <b>18</b>. The combined continuous topsheet web <b>18</b>, liquid acquisition layer <b>50</b>, and absorbent core <b>14</b> are then advanced to subsequent converting operations to complete assembly of absorbent articles <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, a continuous topsheet web <b>18</b> having a first surface <b>302</b> and an opposing second surface <b>304</b> is combined with a liquid acquisition system or layer <b>50</b>.

For example, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>14</b>, and <b>17</b>-<b>20</b>, the inspection system <b>600</b> may include a radiation source <b>606</b> that illuminates a surface of an absorbent structure with a predetermined pattern of light <b>608</b> extending in the cross direction CD. Example radiation sources <b>606</b> may include a laser line generator, such as for example a Coherent model SNF-501L-660-35-30-K, 660 nm/35 mW. It is to be appreciated that the radiation source <b>606</b> and the sensor <b>602</b> may be separate stand-alone units or may be incorporated together into another unit, such as for example, a Keyence LJ-V7000 series including a LJ-V7080 head with a LJ-V7001 controller. Such radiation sources may illuminate absorbent structures with light having various wavelengths wherein the light is detectable by the sensor. For example, in some embodiments, a radiation source <b>606</b> may illuminate with blue light that can be defined as light having wavelengths from about 370 nm to about 500 nm inclusive. In some embodiments, a radiation source <b>606</b> may illuminate with red light that can be defined as light having wavelengths from about 632 nm to about 780 nm inclusive. Example radiation sources <b>606</b> may also include a digital light projector or DLP, such as for example, a Light Commander available from Texas Instruments, which may illuminate with white light. In turn, the sensor <b>602</b> senses distortions in patterns of light <b>610</b> reflected from the illuminated surface of the absorbent structure and triangulates changes in elevation of the illuminated surface of the absorbent structure relative to the sensor <b>602</b>. In some instances, the sensor <b>602</b> may read the position and deformation of a laser line and computes three-dimensional profile at speeds up to 4,000 images per second or 4 KHz. In some embodiments, the sensor <b>602</b> may read the position and deformation of a laser line and computes three-dimensional profile at speeds up to 64,000 images per second or 64 KHz. Based on the triangulated changes in elevation, the sensors <b>602</b> create a profile representing a surface topography of the illuminated surface of the absorbent structure. It is to be appreciated that various types of sensors <b>602</b> may be used, such as for example, structured light sensors. Examples of such sensors may include a Keyence LJ-V7300; Cognex DS1000; SICK Ranger C; and Automation Technology C2-2040HS-GigE.
