      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to methods for producing silicic dense film, which can be used for manufacturing semiconductor devices.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Silicic films, which are relatively hard and dense, are used in various applications, specifically a hard-coat film, a gas barrier film and a reinforcement film for substrates and circuits and the like in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Various silicic films for such applications have been investigated. Non-Patent Document 1 discloses a method for forming a SiON layer by coating polysilazane on a substrate, drying, and then irradiating with excimer laser (wavelength 172 nm) in an inert gas atmosphere. Patent Document 1 also discloses a method for forming a high-performance gas barrier film using a similar method. Thus, methods for high-performance silicic films have been investigated by using a composition having SiâN, SiâH and NâH bonds.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In particular, Patent Document 1 discloses a method of repeating manufacturing steps for forming film to obtain more stable film. However, the present inventors have found that density of the film may be insufficient when irradiation light is limited to 172 nm wavelength. Patent Document 2 also discloses a method for forming a siliceous film by coating polysilazane containing a catalyst on a substrate, drying, and then irradiating with vacuum ultraviolet (wavelength under 230 nm) and ultraviolet (wavelength 230-300 nm) simultaneously, tandemly or alternately in a water vapor atmosphere. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of density of the siliceous film.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Patent Document 3 also discloses that gas barrier performance is degraded in consequence of increased concentration of SiâO bonds in a formed film, which is irradiated with vacuum ultraviolet light in a high-oxygen atmosphere. According to this disclosure, a film having many SiâN bonds, not SiâO bonds, is considered to be preferred to achieve a high-performance gas barrier film.</p>

Examples of the optional additives include crosslinking accelerators and viscosity modifiers. Further, the composition can contain a phosphorus compound, for example tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphate, for the sake of Na-gettering effect in the semiconductor manufacturing process.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0033">The above polymer and, if necessary, other additives are dissolved or dispersed in the above solvent to prepare the composition for a coating film in the present invention. In this preparation, there are no particular restrictions on the order of dissolving the components in the solvent. Further, the solvent can be replaced after the components are made to react.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0034">Further, the contained amount of each component depends on the application of the composition. To achieve adequate film thickness, the content of the polymer is preferably 0.1 to 40 wt %, more preferably 0.1 to 20 wt %, and further preferably 0.1 to 10 wt %. When the composition comprises the amine compound, the content of the amine compound is preferably more than a certain amount to accelerate curing reaction and less than a certain amount to maintain preservation stability of the composition. Thus, the content of the amine compound is preferably 0.005 to 0.50 mmol per 1 g polymer, more preferably 0.01 to 0.30 mmol. When the composition comprises the metal complex compound, the content of the metal complex compound is preferably more than a certain amount to accelerate adequate curing reaction and less than a certain amount to maintain preservation stability of the composition.

When the composition comprises the metal complex compound, it is also possible to use a cosolvent such as anisole to promote the solubility.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0035">A coating method to apply above composition on a substrate can be adopted from known methods, such as spin coating, dip coating, spray coating, roll coating, print-transfer coating and the like. Among them, spin coating is preferred. Thickness of a coated film is preferred to be set in order to cure efficiently when irradiated with UV light in the manner described later. When dense silicic films are formed on both sides of a substrate, it can be coated sequentially one side by one, or simultaneously on both sides.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0036">The coated film formed on a substrate surface is then optionally dried to remove excess solvent. In this step, if the coated film is dried at relatively high temperature, the solvent can be efficiently removed. However, that is not preferred because such external thermal energy leads to increase the thermal energy cost. Consequently, the coated film is preferably dried without applying thermal energy. When the coated film is dried nevertheless at high temperature, the drying temperature is preferably 150Â° C. or below, more preferably 100Â° C. or below.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0037">The coated film can also be dried under reduced pressure. Specifically, negative pressure can be applied to the coated substrate by means of for example a vacuum pump, a rotary pump, so as to accelerate evaporation of the solvent in the coated film and thereby to promote the drying.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0038">The coated film, from which is removed excess solvent by drying, may be optionally blown by an inert gas such as nitrogen. This process can remove attached-matter on the surface of the coated film and enhance efficiency of light irradiation. Furthermore, it is possible to remove, for example, solvent on the surface by infrared-ray irradiation.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0039">Subsequently, the coated film is irradiated with light. The conditions of the UV irradiation in the first irradiation step or the second irradiation step are properly selected according to the thickness, constituent hardness, and the like of the aimed gas barrier film.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0040">First, irradiation light used in the first irradiation step has a maximal peak in the range of 160-179 nm wavelength, preferably 165-175 nm wavelength. This first irradiation step is supposed to accelerate curing near-surface of the coated film (described later in detail).</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0041">As light sources for the irradiation, any light sources, typically Xenon excimer laser, can be used as long as it emits light of said specific wavelength. A lamp which emits light having wide-range wavelength also can be used by selecting said specific wavelength with a filter or a spectrometer.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0042">Then, at the second irradiating step, the coated film is irradiated with light, which has a longer maximal peak wavelength than the light used in the first irradiating step and the peak wavelength is equal to or less than 230 nm, preferably in the range of 180-230 nm. This second irradiation step is supposed to accelerate curing deep part of the coated film (described later in detail). The light used in the second irradiation step may be any light that the maximal peak wavelength is longer than that used in the first irradiation step, but it should be noted that too small difference of the maximal peaks may result in the insufficient curing reaction because different part is not irradiated by the first and second irradiations. Thus, the difference of the maximal peaks of the light in the first and second irradiation steps preferably equal to or more than 10 nm wavelength, more preferably equal to or more 15 nm wavelength.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0043">Additionally, the coated film can be irradiated with light. The wavelength of the light is not limited. As the curing accelerated part of the film in depth direction is varied depending on wavelength of the irradiation light, it can be selected depending on objectives. In specific, longer wavelength of the irradiation light can accelerate curing of deeper part of the film and shorter wavelength of the irradiation light can accelerate curing of shallower part of the film, which has already cured. Thus, the coated film can be irradiated by any wavelength at any times after the second irradiation step.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0044">However, the third irradiation step, wherein the coated film after the second irradiation step is irradiated with light having longer maximal peak wavelength than the light used in the second irradiating step, is preferred to be after the second irradiation step. This third irradiation step enables to accelerate curing of the coated film in any depth and to improve density of the whole film. Here in, the light used in the third irradiation step, which has longer maximal peak wavelength than the light used in the second irradiation step, enables to accelerate curing the deeper part of the coated film. In the meanwhile, too long irradiation wavelength may not accelerate curing any more. Thus, the light used in the third irradiation step is preferred to have 10-60 nm wavelength longer maximal peak than the light used in the second irradiating step.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0045">Any light sources can be used as long as it emits light of said specific wavelength at each irradiation step. A lamp which emits light having relatively wide-range wavelength such as an ultraviolet lamp and a mercury lamp can be used by selecting said specific wavelength with a filer or a spectrometer.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0046">The mechanism that this two-step irradiation enables to obtain a dense silicic film is not fully understood, but estimated as follows. At first, the coated film, the surface of the film is cured, is formed by light having the relatively shorter wavelength in the first irradiation step. This curing film contains a high content of SiâN bonds and has excellent gas barrier performance. Thus, it reduces penetration of oxygen gas into the deep part of coated film. Additionally, when the coated film is irradiated with the light having longer wavelength, the deeper part of it is cured. As penetration of oxygen is reduced in this situation, the amount of absorbed oxygen of the curing film is reduced. Consequently, the dense coated film containing a high content of SiâN bonds is formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0047">In fact, for example, when light of 230 nm wavelength is irradiated and then light of 172 nm wavelength is irradiated, the formed film results in containing a high content of SiâO bonds and a low content of SiâN bonds.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0048">An atmosphere, wherein the coated film is irradiated, can be freely selected based on the aimed constituent of the film, but an atmosphere which prevents oxygen from penetrating into the coated film, specifically an atmosphere containing less oxygen, is preferred for irradiation. In particular, the oxygen concentration in an atmosphere is preferably equal to or less than 1000 ppm, more preferably equal to or less than 100 ppm. To meet this condition, irradiation can be done under vacuum, reduced pressure or inert gas atmosphere. Further, irradiation in the atmosphere, wherein inert gas is introduced after decompression, is also effective. Here in, inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, helium and mixture thereof can be used. Specifically, nitrogen is preferred from the point view of handling property and the like. In this case, nitrogen gas is inert and neither absorbed nor associated with increased concentration of nitrogen in the coated film. The irradiation is not necessarily carried out in an airtight chamber, and can be performed in a flow of inert gas. Further, the irradiation can be carried out in a mixture of inert gas with, for example, ammonia or nitrous oxide. In this case, as ammonia or nitrous oxide serves as a nitrogen source of SiâN bonds of the coated film, the content of SiâN bonds can be increased.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0049">The coated film can be heated at the same time as the irradiation in the first irradiation step and second irradiation step. This heating can accelerate curing reaction. The ways of heating is freely-selected such as heating atmosphere gas.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0050">This irradiation cures polymers including a silazane-bond in the coated film. This conversion can be monitored by means of FT-IR. Specifically, with the conversion proceeds, the absorption peaks at 3350 cm<sup>â1 </sup>and 1200 cm<sup>â1</sup>, which are attributed to NâH bonds, and the peak at 2200 cm<sup>â1</sup>, which is attributed to SiâH bonds, become weak. Consequently, the curing reaction can be confirmed by observing decrease in intensity of those peaks.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0051">Thus formed gas barrier film is excellent in stability, in density and in transparency, and hence can be used as a gas barrier film in a semiconductor device, a protective film or an insulating film. Further, the film can be also used as a top or bottom antireflective film in a process of producing a semiconductor device. Specifically, in a pattern formation process in which a resist pattern is formed by photolithography, it can be used as an antireflective film on the upper- or substrate-side surface of the resist layer in order to prevent reflection or interference in the resist layer. The coated film according to the present invention is advantageously used as an antireflective film, in particular, as a bottom antireflective film formed on a substrate-side surface of the resist layer.</p>

      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0060">Subsequently, the coated wafer was placed into an exposure apparatus, wherein nitrogen was introduced and oxygen concentration was equal to or less than 100 ppm, and irradiated with light having maximal peak 172 nm, 190 nm, 230 nm, or 365 nm wavelength. Each irradiance was 5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, 16 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, 3.5 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>or 3.7 W/cm<sup>2</sup>.

      <heading id="h-00015-en" level="2">Evaluation</heading>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0061">After irradiation, IR spectra of the coated film were measured by the FT-IR measurement. The thickness of coated films was measured by an ellipsometer. Thickness of all films was about 100 nm.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0062">Then, the film was oxidation-treated in 250Â° C. superheated steam condition for 15 minutes. After the treatment, FT-IR was measured again.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0063">A density and stability of formed gas barrier film was evaluated by comparing the IR spectrum after irradiation with the IR spectrum after curing in the heated steam. Specifically, each formed film was classified into the following grades:</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0000">A: IR spectra, which were before-and-after superheated steam treatment, showed little change of peak intensity at about 1000-1200 cm<sup>â1 </sup>attributed to SiâO bonds, <br /> B: IR spectra showed a little change of peak intensity corn in comparison with A, <br /> C: IR spectra showed a big change of peak intensity in a clearly recognizable way. <br /> In specific, <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, <figref>FIG. 2</figref> and <figref>FIG. 3</figref> are results of Example 5, Example 1, and Example 37 respectively and each evaluated as A, B and C. Thus, when a dense silicic film is formed by ultraviolet irradiation, superheated steam treatment accelerates little reaction and there is little amount of peak change. On the other hand, if ultraviolet irradiation is insufficient, superheated steam treatment accelerates the reaction and there is a big change on peak intensity corresponding to a formation of SiâO bonds. The results were shown in Table 1. </p>
