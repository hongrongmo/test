    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">A composition useful for cell capture, the composition comprising a solid substrate on which is affixed a patterned polymer, and a cell-targeting agent attached to said patterned polymer, wherein said cell-targeting agent is exposed. Also described is a method for the preparation of the cell capturing composition, as well as flow through devices in which the cell capturing composition is incorporated. Further described is a method of capturing cells by contacting the cell-capturing composition with a liquid or gaseous sample containing cells. The method for capturing cells may also be a method for testing for the presence of one or more classes or species of cells or cellular organisms in a liquid or gaseous sample.</p>

      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to compositions and methods for cell capture, and more particularly, the use of cell-targeting agents on a solid support for this purpose.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The capture and study of microbes, either in liquid or air, remains an important field of study. Such methods permit a better understanding of the classes and phenotypes of microbes inhabiting a medium and further elucidation of mechanisms involved in their growth and proliferation. Unfortunately, a cost-effective method for cell capture and identification of specific types of microbes has remained elusive.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Cell surface carbohydrates, in particular, play an important role in a variety of processes related to cell growth and proliferation. In microbial systems, extracellular carbohydrates are critical in biofouling, host-microbe interactions, cell motility, and immune recognition processes. Due to the highly dynamic nature of extracellular glycan expression, an understanding of the role of exopolysaccharides (EPS) in many microbial systems is generally lacking. Currently, chromatography, mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are among the techniques employed to analyze extracellular glycans, but these typically require additional processing steps that are likely to change the extracellular glycan concentration. This, in turn, generally make these analytical methods inaccurate, slow, low throughput, and expensive. Thus, there would be a significant benefit in a method of capture that could also be used to further elucidate the compositional and/or functional characteristics of cell surface carbohydrates without the significant drawbacks involved in conventional methods of the art. Such knowledge could eventually prove useful for favorably promoting or inhibiting the growth of select microbes in a microbial population.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In one aspect, the invention is directed to a patterned polymer composition useful in cell capture. In the composition, the patterned polymer is affixed to a solid substrate, and a cell-targeting agent is attached to the patterned polymer. In order to permit effective cell capture, the cell-targeting agent is exposed (i.e., accessible) to the microbe-containing environment. In particular embodiments, the cell-targeting agent is a lectin. A particular advantage of lectins is that they are capable of specifically recognizing (and hence, selectively targeting) extracellular oligosaccharide moieties, thereby offering a nondestructive method for compositional and/or functional characterization of microbial exopolysaccharides. In some embodiments, the lectins are attached to the solid substrate by a block-copolymer. The block-copolymer may be, for example, poly(glycidyl methacrylate)-block-4,4-dimethyl-2-vinylazlactone (âPGMA-b-PVDMAâ), which can be employed as a surface scaffold for lectin-specific microbial capture. In some embodiments, the patterned polymer has a three-dimensional topography, which can improve cell capture by providing a higher contact area. In some embodiments, the three-dimensional topography suitably modifies the confinement of the cells and/or promotes microbe-microbe interactions.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In another aspect, the invention is directed to a liquid or gas testing device in which the above-described cell-targeting composition is incorporated. The device can be, for example, any of the flow through devices known in the art useful in conducting assays on a liquid or gas sample.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In another aspect, the invention is directed to a method of capturing cells by contacting the cell-capturing composition or device described above with cells that may be in a liquid or gaseous medium. In particular embodiments, the cell-containing (or more particularly, microbial-containing) medium is passed through a flow-through device containing the above-described capturing composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In yet other aspects, the invention is directed to methods for preparing the capturing composition and/or device into which the composition is incorporated. The method typically includes lithographic patterning of a polymer having a cell-capturing agent attached thereto. In particular embodiments, the method includes lithographic patterning of a polymer on a substrate, wherein the polymer is covalently bound to the substrate and contains functional groups for binding to a cell-capturing agent, followed by covalently binding the cell-capturing agent to the polymer.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In the cell-capturing composition, a patterned polymer is affixed (i.e., attached, generally by covalent means) to a solid substrate. The term âpatternedâ, as used herein, generally refers to the presence of topographical features having a height or depth of at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, or 500 nm, or within a range therein, as could be provided by a lithographic method. The topographical features can be of any shape, and may be outward-facing (i.e., above the base polymer surface) or inward-facing (i.e., below the base polymer surface, as an indent or trench). The outward- or inward-facing features may be, for example, linear segments, pillars, cones, posts, or a circular or polygonal shape (e.g., triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, or octagon) having a height or depth in the nanometer range, as well as regular or random arrays of such shapes. Some exemplary shapes include lines and square grids. In some embodiments, the patterned polymer can have a three-dimensional structure. The term âthree dimensional structure,â as used herein, generally refers to a polymeric material having a structure beyond that of a monolayer of a polymer brush (i.e., a multilayer structure), generally with protruding features having heights (i.e., from the polymer base) beyond that of a monolayer of a polymer brush, i.e., generally at least or greater than 500 nm, 600 nm, 700 nm, 800 nm, 900 nm, 1 Î¼m, 1.5 Î¼m, 2 Î¼M, 2.5 Î¼M, 3 Î¼m, 3.5 Î¼m, 4 Î¼m, 4.5 Î¼m, or 5 Î¼m, or a value within a range bounded by any two of these values. The length and/or diameter of the features (i.e., along the plane of the substrate surface) may be any of the values provided above for the height or depth, and may or may not also extend into higher values of the micron scale, e.g., at least, greater than, up to, or less than 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, or 500 Î¼m. In some embodiments, the polymer possesses a three-dimensional structure on a relatively flat substrate surface. In other embodiments, the polymer possesses a three-dimensional structure by being affixed to a substrate with a defined three-dimensional structure. In yet other embodiments, the polymer possesses a three-dimensional structure distinct from a separate three-dimensional structure possessed by the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The patterned polymer may be varied in terms of its pitch. The term âpitchâ, as used herein, is an indication of the frequency of features (e.g., protrusions or indentations) per unit length or area. The frequency of features can be expressed as a distance between features (e.g., line center to line center distance), or may be expressed as a frequency of features per unit length or area. The term âpitchâ may herein be understood to be equivalent to the term âpattern densityâ, which may more generally refer to the number of features per area. In some embodiments, the term âpitchâ refers to the line spacing between features, whereas the term âpattern densityâ refers to the number of features per unit length or area, in which case a decrease in pitch corresponds to an increase in pattern density, and vice-versa. Generally, when the term âpitchâ or âpattern densityâ is applied, the features are regularly spaced. The variation of pitch may be applied to any shape of the patterned polymer, including line and square shapes. In some embodiments, the patterned polymer possesses a pitch of about, at least, above, up to, or less than, for example, 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 85, 90, or 100 Î¼m, or a value within a range bounded by any two of the foregoing values. Any of foregoing pitch values may be taken as or correspond to (i.e., by appropriate calculation) a pattern density. One advantage of tuning the pitch of the patterned polymer is that it results in a change in the aggregation of the microbes that interact with the cell-targeting agent. <figref>FIGS. 8-10</figref> provide an illustration of tuning the pitch of the patterned polymer that can result in a dramatic effect on the aggregation of microbes.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The patterned polymer can have any composition and structure, provided that it is stable under the conditions used, e.g., insoluble and non-degradable in an aqueous medium if used in such a medium. A variety of commercial substrates are available that contain surface polymers that can be modified with secondary molecules in an aqueous medium. For example, NETERIONÂ® Slide H covalently immobilizes peptides and proteins, such as antibodies, antibody fragments, enzymes or receptors, on a dedicated slide surface. The polymer can be a homopolymer or copolymer (which may be a bipolymer, terpolymer, tetrapolymer, or higher functional polymer), either of which may be linear or branched, wherein the branched polymer may also be a star, brush, or comb type of branched polymer. In the case of a copolymer, the copolymer can be, for example, a block, alternating, periodic, random, or graft copolymer. The polymer can have any suitable number of units, such as at least, above, up to, or less than, for example, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 5000, 10,000, or more units.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The polymer is typically one that can either be grown on or facilely coated onto the surface of a solid substrate. The polymer can be, for example, a vinyl addition polymer (e.g., a polyacrylate, polymethacrylate, poly(methyl acrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, and the like), polyester, polyurethane, polyamide, epoxide (as derived from an epoxy resin), or polyimide. Before attachment to the solid substrate, the polymer preferably contains functional groups that can react with and form permanent bonds (e.g., covalent bonds) with groups found on the substrate surface. For example, in the case where the substrate surface contains hydroxy groups, the polymer may contain suitable hydroxy-reactive groups, such as epoxy or isocyanate groups, or the substrate surface may be functionalized with epoxy, carboxy, or isocyanate groups in the event the polymer contains hydroxy or amino groups. Moreover, the polymer may be a single polymer or a combination of polymers, wherein a combination of polymers may be within a single layer as a mixture, or may be constructed of two or more layers of different types of polymers. In the case of multiple layers, the polymer layers should be attached to each other without release during cell capture.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The patterned polymer may have any suitable thickness, which is herein defined as the distance from the substrate surface (in contact with the polymer) to polymeric features of maximum height. In different embodiments, the patterned polymer possesses a thickness of about, at least, above, up to, or less than, for example, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, or 10,000 nm, or a value within a range bounded by any two of the foregoing values. In one embodiment, the thickness of the patterned polymer is from 75 nm to 10 Î¼m. In another embodiment, the thickness of the patterned polymer is from 115 nm to 2 Î¼m. In another embodiment, the thickness of the patterned polymer is from 250 nm to 10 Î¼m. In yet another embodiment, the thickness of the patterned polymer is from 500 nm to 2 Î¼m.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">A particular advantage of the patterned polymer described herein is its high level of polyvalency, i.e., large number of reactive groups per unit area, which results in an enhanced performance of the cell-targeting agent. Further improvements are herein made possible by use of the specially crafted surface topography described above, along with the patterned polymer thickness, the choice of patterning, and the pitch of the patterned polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The cell-targeting agent is attached to the patterned polymer. The cell-targeting agent can be attached by any bonding mode that retains the cell-targeting agent on the patterned polymer at least up to cell capture. The cell-targeting agent may be bound to the patterned polymer by, for example, covalent bonding, ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding, or affinity bonding. The cell-targeting agent is any substance capable of binding to a cell. Since exopolysaccharides (i.e., âEPSâ) are found on the surfaces of most cells, the instant disclosure particularly considers cell-targeting agents that target EPS, such as carbohydrate-binding proteins. Some particular carbohydrate-binding proteins considered herein are the lectins. The lectin can be any of the lectins known in the art, including lectins that have been modified to selectively bind to specific types of EPS or cells, or a lectin fragment. The lectin or lectin fragment can be, for example, a mannose-binding, galactose-binding, N-acetylgalactosamine-binding, N-acetylglucosamine-binding, N-acetylneuraminic acid-binding, or fucose-binding type of lectin. The lectin may also be derived from a specific source, such as wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), concanavalin A, lentil lectin, peanut agglutinin, or elderberry lectin. Other cell-targeting agents may or may not include antibodies or antibody fragments. Yet other cell-targeting agents may or may not include RNA and DNA aptamers, as described in <i>J. Sep. Sci., </i>32(10):1523-30, 2009, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. Further examples of cell-targeting agents may or may not include extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen, laminin and fibronection, as well as carbohydrates, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides, as described in <i>J Am. Chem. Soc., </i>133:13957-13966, 2011, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. In the case where the cell is a microbe, or more particularly, a bacteria, the cell-targeting agent can be considered to be a microbe-targeting or bacteria-targeting agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The cell-targeting agent needs to be exposed so that it is accessible to the cell. The term âexposedâ, as used herein, generally means that the cell-targeting agent resides on the surface of the patterned polymer and is not covered by or embedded within the polymer or other solid substance.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The solid substrate on which the patterned polymer is coated can be made of any material on which a polymer can be attached and patterned, and which is amenable and non-reactive with substances in which it comes into contact during the cell capture process. The substrate can be, for example, metallic (e.g., metal or metal alloy, generally corrosion resistant and non-reactive), semiconductor, metal oxide, or plastic. The term âmetallicâ, as used herein, is also meant to encompass those compositions that may include one or more non-metal elements (e.g., carbon, silicon, nitrogen, or boron), but which maintain substantial metallic character, e.g., metal carbides, silicides, nitrides, and borides. The term âsemiconductorâ is meant to encompass all of those materials known in the art to have semiconducting properties, including, for example, silicon and germanium, and their nitride, phosphide, sulfide, selenide, and telluride compositions, as well as related compositions based on boron, aluminum, gallium, indium, arsenic, and antimony (e.g., aluminum, gallium, and indium nitrides, phosphides, arsenides, sulfides, selenides, and tellurides). The term âmetal oxideâ, as used herein, is also meant to encompass ceramic and hybrid organic-inorganic materials. In particular embodiments, the metal oxide is or includes silicon oxide (silica), cerium oxide (ceria), yttrium oxide (yttria), titanium oxide (titania), zirconium oxide (zirconia), indium oxide, tin oxide, indium tin oxide, hafnium oxide, spinel oxide, or a perovskite oxide, or a combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In another aspect, the invention is directed to methods for producing the cell-capture composition described above. In the method, a polymer is first coated onto a solid substrate by any of the means known in the art. For example, the substrate surface can be spin coated, spray coated, or dip coated by means well known in the art. The method for coating the polymer should include means for the polymer to become permanently bound to the solid substrate, typically by covalent bonding. Other bonding modes, such as ionic, hydrogen bonding, or affinity bonding (e.g., by biotin-avidin coupling) may also be possible, provided the polymer does not detach from the solid substrate during use. In particular embodiments, the surface of the solid substrate possesses, or is made to possess, functional groups that can be reacted with and form covalent bonds with the polymer. For example, the solid substrate may be made to possess oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., hydroxy and/or carboxylic acid) by treatment in an oxygen plasma. Such surface functional groups can be reacted with suitably reactive groups (e.g., epoxy, activated ester, anhydride, isocyanate, or amino groups) on the polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Various methodologies can be used to introduce nanoscale, microscale, or three-dimensional features into the polymer to result in a patterned polymer. The patterning method is typically based on photolithography, but may be another method known in the art capable of producing such features, such as self-assembly or scribing methods. In a first embodiment, the substrate surface is patterned with reactive functional groups, such as by pattern masking followed by oxygen plasma, and the patterned surface reacted with the polymer to provide a patterned polymer. In a second embodiment, the polymer is coated onto an unpatterned substrate, and the polymer, as coated, is patterned by means known in the art, e.g., the polymer may include positive or negative resist groups that can be activated during a photolithographic, ultraviolet, or electron beam exposure process, and then developed. In a third embodiment, a mask, which is a removable material that selectively protects the underlying substrate, is coated and patterned onto a substrate. The polymer is then coated onto the patterned mask and substrate. Upon removal of the mask, the polymer is selectively left behind on the substrate in the regions unprotected by the mask. The foregoing process can be referred to as a âlift-off processâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The cell-targeting agent can be attached to the patterned polymer by means well known in the art. In one embodiment, functional groups reactive with the cell-targeting agent are in the polymer when the polymer is coated onto the substrate; after coating the polymer, the cell-targeting agent is reacted with the patterned polymer to form covalent or other permanent bonds therewith. For example, in the case of a lectin or antibody cell-targeting agent, the polymer may contain protein-binding groups therein, such as lactone groups (or more specifically, azlactone groups), activated ester groups, maleimide, or phenyl azide groups for covalent binding to the lectin or antibody. In another embodiment, the polymer is coated onto the substrate and then functionalized with functional groups reactive with the cell-targeting agent, before or after patterning, and the cell-targeting agent reacted with the patterned polymer to form covalent or other permanent bonds therewith. The functionalization of such polymers is well known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The patterned polymer can be modified to maximize the concentration of cell-targeting agent that is attached to the patterned polymer. This can be realized by, for example, optimizing block length, composition, and/or film thickness of the patterned polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">In another aspect, the invention is directed to a cell capture device into which the above-described cell capture composition is incorporated. The cell capture composition is incorporated in the device in such a manner that a liquid or gas being tested makes contact with the cell capture composition. The cell capture device can have, for example, any of the flow through designs and components known in the art for testing of fluid or gaseous samples. In some embodiments, the capture device operates by any of the gravity-assisted vertical flow or lateral flow designs known in the art, such as those used in Coulter counters.

      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In another aspect, the invention is directed to a method of cell capture by use of the cell-capturing composition or device described above. In the method, the cell capture composition is contacted with a liquid or gaseous medium to be analyzed. If the cell capture composition is incorporated into a device, the device includes the necessary and/or optional components, as well known in the art (e.g., filters, channels, wells, micropumps, valves, and the like) for directing or channeling the fluid or gas to the cell capture composition. In some embodiments, the liquid or gaseous medium to be analyzed is known to contain cellular material, whereas, in other embodiments, the liquid or gaseous medium may not be known to contain cellular material or a particular cellular material being sought, but is being tested to determine if such cellular material is present. In the case of a liquid sample, the liquid may be from any source in which cellular material may reside. The liquid may be, for example, a biological fluid (e.g., saliva, blood, urine, mucus, or ocular fluid) from an organism, such as a mammal, and more particularly, a human. The liquid may alternatively be from a non-living source, such as an industrial or sewage waste stream, or a natural source, such as a water spring, aquifer, lake, pond, or the deep sea. A gaseous sample may also be from any of the sources mentioned above, or may be air sampled from within a manmade structure (e.g., a home or industry) or from the outdoors.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The term âcellâ, as used herein, refers to the basic structural building block of living organisms having at least a cell membrane (which may be a cell wall, in the case of a plant) that encloses a protoplasm and organelles. For purposes of the instant invention, the cell particularly considered herein is one that contains exopolysaccharides on its surface. The cell may have a cell nucleus (i.e., a eukaryotic cell) or lack a cell nucleus (i.e., a prokaryotic cell). Moreover, the term âcellâ, as used herein, may refer to a single cell (i.e., monocellular) or a multiplicity of cells that may be agglomerated or that may form a microscale multicellular organism, wherein the unicellular or multicellular organism under consideration is typically no more than about 100 microns in size. In one embodiment, the cell is a mammalian cell, which may be from any bodily tissue or fluid, including cancerous or pre-cancerous tissue. In another embodiment, the cell is a living organism, i.e., a microbe, which may be, for example, a bacterium, fungus (e.g., mold spore), protist, or plant cell. In some embodiments, the cell being captured may not be living, such as in a dormant or dead state. In particular embodiments, the cells being targeted are pathogenic and possibly infectious microbes, such as those belonging to <i>Streptococcus, Staphylococcus</i>, E. Coll, mycobacteria, <i>Helicobacter pylori, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella</i>, and <i>Chlamydia. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The term âcell captureâ, as used herein, refers to a binding interaction between the immobilized cell-capturing agent and the cell. The binding interaction may occur by any of the known binding modes, e.g., covalent, ionic, hydrogen bonding, or affinity bonds. In some embodiments, the binding interaction is temporary (i.e., is followed by release), while in other embodiments, the binding interaction is permanent. In the case of a temporary interaction, in a first embodiment, the temporary interaction is of sufficient time to permit study of the captured cells in the captured state (followed by subsequent release), while in a second embodiment, the temporary interaction is of sufficient time only for the cell to deposit a substance or react with the capture agent or other aspect of the polymer, with subsequent study of the deposited or reacted cellular substance and not the captured cell itself. In some embodiments, the interaction may function to modify aspects of the cell, e.g., to activate or deactivate cell growth, promote or reduce cell adhesion, modify mammalian cell chemotaxis, alter cell population distributions, or promote cell death, any of which may or may not be selective to particular cell types within a distribution of cell types.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In some embodiments, the polymer is functionalized with additional functional groups, in addition to the cell capture agent, that augment or suitably modify the efficacy, selectivity, or function of the cell capture agent. The additional functional groups may be, for example, another (different) cell capture agent (e.g., a combination of specific and non-specific cell capture agents, or two different specific capture agents), or a group that does not function as a cell capture agent but has a desired effect on the cell capture agent. For example, the polymer may include protein-coupling groups that are made to couple to more than one cell-targeting protein, or couple to a combination of a specific cell-targeting protein and a non-specific protein, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA). These embodiments may be particularly advantageous in that the additional functional groups can be included in amounts that manipulate the lectin surface concentration to result in tunable or selective cell capture. In some embodiments, the additional functional groups can be anti-microbial (e.g., anti-bacterial) agents, such as any of the small peptides and other molecules (e.g., quaternary ammonium salts) known for this purpose, e.g., Yu et al., âNanopatterned smart polymer surfaces for controlled attachment, killing, and release of bacteriaâ, <i>ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, </i>5(19):9295-304 (2013), the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. By including anti-microbial agents, the resulting cell-capture composition can function as a biocidal surface (and in particular embodiments, a selective biocidal surface) that can kill microbes captured from a community of microbes. In other embodiments, the additional functional groups may be fluorophores or chromogenic in nature, in which case the presence of a particular type or species of cell or microbe may be detected by a change in the fluorophore or color intensity or wavelength upon capture of the cell or microbe. In yet other embodiments, the additional functional groups may be enzymatic groups that elicit an observable change in color or other spectroscopic signature upon cell capture, or that desirably alter cell growth.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In one embodiment, the cell-targeting agent can be selected to target a broad range of cells. In another embodiment, the cell-targeting agent can be selected to target specific types of cells, or a particular genus or species of bacteria or other microbe.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The patterned or three-dimensional structure of the polymer endows the polymer with a significantly greater ability to capture and retain cells as compared to an unpatterned version of the polymer. Without being bound by any theory, it is believed that cells are significantly more inclined to bind to sharp vertices or edges of the patterned features as compared to smooth parts of the polymer. Thus, by inclusion of such features, a significantly greater cell capture density has been realized.</p>

In the scheme shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the azlactone protein-coupling group may be replaced with any other suitable protein-coupling group, and the epoxy group may be replaced with any other suitable reactive group capable of bonding with the solid substrate.

Four-inch silicon (Si) wafers were used. Poly(glycidyl methacrylate)-block-poly(vinyldimethyl azlactone) (PGMA-b-PVDMA) of block lengths of 56 and 175, respectively, were synthesized as previously described (Lokitz, B.

Wafers were then exposed for 6 s with a contact mask aligner and developed in CD-26 for 2 min., rinsed with DI H<sub>2</sub>O, and dried with nitrogen. Wafers were then treated with oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) plasma using a Tepla Ion Wave 10 plasma processing system to remove residual resist and diced into 10Ã10 mm substrates. Wafers contained arrays of spots 10 or 50 Î¼m in diameter with a pitch of 20 or 100 Î¼m, respectively. Prior to spin coating, substrates were again treated with 3 min. of oxygen plasma to provide surface hydroxyl groups for reaction with epoxy groups present on the PGMA block. 100 Î¼L of a 1 wt % solution of PGMA56-b-PVDMA175 in anhydrous CHCl<sub>3 </sub>was then spin-coated over the substrate (Laurell WS-400B-6NPP/LITE) at 1500 rpm for 15 s and baked at 110Â° C. under vacuum for 18 hrs to allow for microphase segregation and surface attachment.

        <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens </i>GM30 was used in this study. Microbes were cultured on tryptone yeast (TY) agar plates (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 15 g agar per liter) for 24-48 hours at 28Â° C. and then maintained at ambient conditions for up to one week. For growth in liquid, a single colony was used to inoculate liquid TY media in sterile 20 mL glass tubes. The microbes were grown to logarithmic phase in a shaking incubator set at 28Â° C. and 200 rpm, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 1ÃPBS at an OD<sub>600 </sub>of 0.1.

To remove unattached microbes, substrates were washed for 5 min. with a 0.05% solution of Tween 20 in 1ÃPBS. The remaining adherent microbes were then chemically fixed to the surface by incubating the substrate in a 2.5% solution of glutaraldehyde in H<sub>2</sub>O.

      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">Analysis</heading>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Brightfield and Fluorescence Microscopy. All images of silicon substrates containing arrays of PGMA-b-PVDMA or Si supports were taken in brightfield or fluorescence (20Ã, NA 0.40/50Ã, NA 0.85/100Ã, NA 0.95) with an upright microscope (BX51, Olympus). For characterizations of microbial adhesion levels on the substrates, 20 to 30 representative images of each substrate were taken near the center of the 10Ã10 mm arrays.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Atomic Force Microscopy. An atomic force microscope (Park Systems) was used to image the PGMA-b-PVDMA patterns. NanoWorldÂ® PNP-TR B cantilevers with a resonance frequency of 17 kHz and a force constant of 0.08 N m<sup>â1 </sup>were used in contact mode. Scan areas were varied between 4 and 1600 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>. Images were captured at a scan rate of 0.2-0.6 Hz. Support heights and surface roughness were analyzed using Park software.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Polymer films were characterized using a Harrick Scientific VariGATR instrument with a germanium crystal and a MCT detector. Spectra were analyzed using OPUS software. The crystal was cleaned with methanol prior to each sample. A background spectrum was collected using 128 scans, and samples were collected as the average of 512 scans. All spectra were baseline corrected.</p>

Microbial adhesion levels on PGMA-b-PVDMA or Si supports were analyzed using image thresholding by the triangle method. To quantify the microbial growth from the support exterior, the increase in support area with microbial deposition was measured. 200 representative surface supports were measured under each condition investigated.</p>

      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Results and Discussion</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The lithographic patterning of PGMA-b-PVDMA onto oxidized silicon surfaces resulted in well defined, three dimensional co-polymer surface structures of 10 Î¼m diameter, as shown in the 50ÃSEM images in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>. A smooth PGMA-b-PVDMA exists in the interior of the scaffold, while the outer edge regions exhibit higher surface roughness, as apparent in the insert in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>. The microphase segregation of the PGMA and PVDMA blocks during the annealing step advantageously resulted in a PGMA-rich interior at the substrate interface for covalent surface attachment and a PVDMA-rich exterior region for secondary functionalization. After fabrication, all PGMA-b-PVDMA supports remained on the silicon substrate through washing steps in organic or aqueous solvents. The AFM image in <figref>FIG. 2B</figref> and the cross-sectional height profile in <figref>FIG. 2C</figref> (across the center of a scaffold corresponding to the dashed line in <figref>FIG. 2B</figref>) show varied internal film thickness with respect to radial direction resulting from patterning using the liftoff process. At the support center, film thickness is minimal, with an average thickness of 115Â±32 nm. This value approaches the expected thickness for a single layer of PGMA-b-PVDMA films (Lokitz et al., 2012, Ibid.). Moving from the center towards the exterior of the support, the film thickness increases non-linearly and is maximum at the edges where the polymer thickness ranges between 500 nm to 2 Î¼m. The formation of stable polymer structures at higher film thicknesses (greater than 90 nm) is influenced by the height of the templating photoresist, and is likely due to the crosslinking of GMA blocks away from the substrate interface, which is favored using an annealing temperature of 110Â° C. Annealing at temperatures &lt;80Â° C. has been shown to eliminate GMA crosslinking while still promoting surface attachment (Lokitz et al., 2012, Ibid.). Thus, it is likely that lower annealing temperature combined with higher diameter posts would favor a single PGMA-b-PVDMA layer of minimal surface height variation.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="1">Lectin Coupling to PGMA-b-PVDMA Surface Supports</heading>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">To investigate the covalent coupling of lectin proteins, WGA-A488 lectin was incubated onto patterned surfaces containing 10 Î¼m diameter PGMA-b-PVDMA surface supports and then imaged using fluorescence microscopy. <figref>FIG. 3A</figref> displays the fluorescence intensities achieved from WGA-A488 lectin coupling to the PGMA-b-PVDMA surface supports under different incubation times. <figref>FIG. 3B</figref> shows the corresponding fluorescence intensity values for the different incubation times. As shown by <figref>FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, after 30 min of coupling, the supports appear brightly fluorescent, with a 10-fold increase in fluorescence signal intensity relative to unmodified PGMA-b-PVDMA supports. Further incubation times did not increase the fluorescent signal, suggesting that the supports are saturated with protein between 15 and 30 min. The high fluorescence signal of the PGMA-b-PVDMA supports relative to the silicon background apparent in the fluorescence images in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref> is likely due to the high concentration of pendant VDMA groups in the support, which results in higher levels of WGA-A488 lectin immobilized over the supports.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The covalent immobilization of WGA-A488 lectin onto the VDMA groups was also verified. Prior to WGA-A488 lectin functionalization, a PGMA-b-PVDMA array was submerged into an aqueous solution of 50 mM ethanol amine at pH 8.5 for 18 hrs. These conditions should allow for sufficient aminolysis of accessible azlactone groups. After 30 min. of WGA-A488 lectin functionalization, an 87Â±1% decrease in fluorescence signal was noted when comparing supports with aminolysed VDMA groups to supports with functional VDMA groups, as shown in the fluorescent intensity profiles in <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>. This demonstrates the key role of the azlactone functionality for immobilization. GATR-FTIR was used to further characterize the functional groups present on PGMA-b-PVDMA surfaces before and after 30 min WGA-A488 functionalization. <figref>FIG. 4B</figref> shows the partial GATR-FTIR spectra of PGMA-b-PVDMA patterned polymers with and without WGA-A488 lectin functionalization. The absorbance at 1820 cm<sup>â1</sup>, which is a measure of azlactone functionality, was specifically monitored. <figref>FIG. 4B</figref> shows a 16% decrease in 1820 cm<sup>â1 </sup>peak height after WGA-A488 functionalization, suggesting that only a fraction of pendant azlactone groups are accessible for protein coupling. This is likely due to a collapsed structure of the VDMA blocks in aqueous buffer, limiting the diffusion of WGA-A488 proteins to internal coupling sites.</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="1">Microbial Adhesion on Lectin Functionalized PGMA-b-PVDMA Supports</heading>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The following study demonstrates that lectin-functionalized PGMA-b-PVDMA supports can be used to capture microbes based on EPS content. <i>P. fluorescens </i>GM30 was chosen as a model microbe in this study because of the high levels of visible cell clumping that were observed during later stages of liquid culture, suggesting high levels of EPS expression. WGA-A488 and LcH-TRITC were used as model capture lectins because they bound specifically to <i>P. fluorescens </i>GM30 in a solution phase lectin-binding assay, indicating the presence of extracellular GlcNAc, GalNAc, or sialic acid residues (WGA specific) as well as extracellular Mannose/GlcNAc/Fucose complex (LcH specific) in the EPS content (Hsu, K.-L., et al., <i>Nat. Protoc., </i>2006, 1, 543-549). BSA-functionalized PGMA-b-PVDMA supports were used as a control to measure non-specific interactions.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">
        <figref>FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> confirm lectin-specific microbial adhesion and flocculation around PGMA-b-PVDMA patterned polymers after capture protein functionalization, microbe incubation, and washing. <figref>FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> show 100Ã brightfield images of posts after incubation with microbes (top row) and corresponding histogram plots of microbial growth area from post exterior from 200 representative patterned polymers (bottom row). <figref>FIG. 5A</figref> shows the results for PGMA-b-PVDMA patterned polymers with WGA-A488 lectin; <figref>FIG. 5B</figref> shows the results for PGMA-b-PVDMA with LcH-TRITC lectin; and <figref>FIG. 5C</figref> shows the results PGMA-b-PVDMA patterned polymers with BSA. The histogram plots in <figref>FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> reflect the distribution in microbe area data generated from 200 representative supports. A statistical comparison of microbe area data between WGA-A488 lectin and BSA proteins (<figref>FIGS. 5A and 5C</figref>) indicates a significant increase due to WGA-A488 lectin functionalization (p&lt;0.01), which evidences WGA-specific microbial capture on the supports. The aggregation of microbes beyond the initial microbe-WGA adhesion layer in <figref>FIG. 5A</figref> is consistent with recent reports of surface-bound <i>Pseudomonas </i>species promoting the recruitment of additional microbes into microcolonies (Zhao, K., et al., <i>Nature</i>, 2014, 497, pp. 388-391). Microbes showed significantly less adhesion onto LcH-TRITC lectin functionalized PGMA-b-PVDMA supports (<figref>FIG. 5B</figref>), although an increase in adhered microbes relative to the BSA control supports was observed.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">
        <i>P. fluorescens </i>GM30 was observed to preferentially adhere to edges of the patterned features. The preferential adhesion onto the PGMA-PVDMA support edges is likely due to the enhanced topographical surface features associated with the edge regions of the spots. In contrast, minimal adhesion is observed in the center of the supports, where the surface appears relatively smooth. A similar trend was noted on two-dimensional substrates containing micropatterned areas of covalently immobilized WGA-A488 lectin on surfaces of low roughness (R<sub>a</sub>=0.23Â±0.03 nm), which also failed to engage <i>P. fluorescens </i>GM30 microbes under the same conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">To further decipher the effect of surface topography for promoting microbial adhesion, the PGMA-b-PVDMA supports were mimicked using 10 Î¼m diameter Si posts etched to a depth of 1.3 Î¼m. In contrast to the PVDMA-b-PVDMA supports, although these surfaces possess comparable surface topologies, they only immobilized captured protein by passive adsorption. WGA-A488 lectin, LcH-TRITC lectin, and BSA were physisorbed onto the silicon structures, followed by microbe incubation and washing under identical conditions as with the PGMA-b-PVDMA supports. <figref>FIGS. 6A-6C</figref> show lectin-specific microbial adhesion and flocculation around Si supports. <figref>FIGS. 6A-6C</figref> show 100Ã brightfield images of posts after incubation with microbes (top row) and corresponding histogram plots of microbial growth area from post exterior from 200 representative supports (bottom row). <figref>FIG. 6A</figref> shows the results for Si support with WGA-A488 lectin; <figref>FIG. 6B</figref> shows the results for Si support with LcH-TRITC lectin; and <figref>FIG. 6C</figref> shows the results for Si support with BSA. Arrows denote attached microbes. Preferential adhesion to the support edges was also noted here, with significantly higher levels of microbes present on WGA-A488 lectin supports compared to LcH-TRITC lectin or BSA supports (p&lt;0.01). However, when comparing the adhered microbe area on WGA-A488 lectin functionalized PGMA-PVDMA supports to WGA-A488 lectin functionalized Si supports (<figref>FIGS. 5A and 6A</figref>), a statistically significant decrease in microbe area in the Si supports is identified (p&lt;0.01).</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">The data from <figref>FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> and <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C is further summarized in Table 1, shown below, which quantifies the increase in support area due to microbial adhesion for each capture protein on both PGMA-PVDMA and Si supports. The enhanced levels of lectin-specific microbial adhesion measured when using PGMA-PVDMA as a support give this material promise for further use in lectin-based cellular screening assays.</p>

      <heading id="h-00015-en" level="1">Conclusions</heading>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0065">There is an unmet need in cell-based assays for creating surfaces that promote the selective and efficient capture of target cells. Platforms based on lectin-carbohydrate recognition can be used to selectively probe the carbohydrate-rich surface of active microbial cells, but generally lack the high affinities necessary for efficient capture. In this disclosure, the design and fabrication of high-avidity surface supports that combine high concentrations of covalently immobilized lectins with micron-scale surface topography are described for overcoming this challenge. The PGMA-b-PVDMA polymers previously reported for tailoring surface functionality (Lokitz et al., 2012, Ibid.) have herein been modified into patterned and three-dimensional surface supports for lectin modification and subsequent microbe capture. Increased levels of microbe adhesion and colony formation measured on different lectin-functionalized PGMA-b-PVDMA, as compared with silicon supports, demonstrate the positive combined impact of high-lectin concentration and physical structure on microbe capture. Continued refinements of this approach, aimed at understanding the impact of specific three-dimensional geometries on capture efficiency and increasing the variety of lectins used in screening promises, will lead to further enhancements, ultimately leading to an experimental platform that will characterize the dynamics of microbial EPS expression with environmental cues, while also enabling âcatch and releaseâ applications aimed at providing enrichment of microbial sub-populations for sequencing.</p>

      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0067">Each wafer consisted of nine replicate pattern sets. The layout of a pattern set is described in <figref>FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>. Each pattern set consisted of six line arrays and five square grids. Within each line array were 5 Î¼m-wide parallel rectangular strips with constant pitch (line center to line center distance). The six line arrays contained a pitch of 7, 10, 15, 25, 45 and 85 Î¼m. Square grid patterns consisted of 5 Î¼m-wide parallel rectangular strips running perpendicular to a second set of 5 Î¼m-wide parallel rectangular strips. The five square grid patterns had a varied pitch of 10, 15, 25, 45, and 85 Î¼m. The overall area of each line array was 1.6 mm<sup>2 </sup>and the overall area of each grid was 1.0 mm<sup>2 </sup>Conventional photolithographic methods were used to first modify the silicon wafers with patterned photoresist, as detailed above. After photoresist patterning, substrates were treated with O<sub>2 </sub>plasma for 3 minutes, and then replicate pattern sets were diced into 20Ã20 mm substrates. Each substrate was spin-coated (1500 rpm, 15 s) with 100 Î¼l quantities of a 1 wt % solution of PGMA-b-PVDMA in anhydrous chloroform and annealed for 18 hours at 110Â° C. Substrates were then sonicated in acetone for 5 minutes to remove the photoresist, leaving behind the patterned PGMA-b-PVDMA films. Substrates were finally rinsed in isopropyl alcohol, dried in N<sub>2</sub>, and stored in a vacuum desiccator until use.</p>

As a negative control to test for nonspecific interactions between microbes and the patterned substrate, surfaces were also functionalized with BSA at the same conditions. <i>P. fluorescens </i>was cultured on LB Agar plates at 29Â° C. for 24-48 hrs and stored at 4Â° C. for up to one week. Liquid cultures were grown by inoculating 5 mL of LB media with a single colony and growing at 29Â° C. with shaking to the logarithmic phase.

      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0069">Brightfield and fluorescence microscopy. All brightfield and fluorescence images (20Ã, NA 0.4/100Ã, NA 0.95) were taken with an upright microscope (BX51, Olympus) using a 16-bit CCD camera (Luminera Corporation, Ottowa, ON) and Infinity Capture software. All fluorescence images (green filter set) were taken either at 20Ã magnification (4Ã4 binning, 0.5 s exposure time, 1.5 gain) or at 100Ã magnification (4Ã4 binning, 0.5 s exposure time, 1.0 gain). Fluorescent images showing the captured microbes were used for quantitative image analysis. Brightfield images of the microbes and PGMA-b-PVDMA films were for visualization only and not used in image analysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0070">Atomic force microscopy (AFM). All AFM images were taken using a Park Systems AFM operating in contact mode with NanoWorld PNP-TR B cantilevers (17 kHz, 0.08 Nm<sup>â1</sup>). Patterned regions were imaged at 90Ã90 Î¼m, 20Ã20 Î¼m and 10Ã10 Î¼m areas. PGMA-b-PVDMA film thickness, maximum edge height, and average roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) were analyzed using XEI Park System software. R<sub>a </sub>measurements were measured from a 2Ã2 Î¼m region of interest centered directly over the edge region or over the internal PGMA-b-PVDMA pattern regions (regions of maximum distance from the edges). Three replicate substrates were analyzed in all measurements.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0071">Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A Carl Zeiss Merlin SEM was used to image patterned PGMA-b-PVDMA films. Charge compensation was used during sample imaging and no sample pretreatment was required. The SEM was operated at 1.7 kV and all images were taken at 5-6.5 KX magnification.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0072">Image processing and data analysis. Two-dimensional measurements of microbe aggregate area were determined using image thresholding and particle analysis with the Triangle method (ImageJ 1.47v). An example of the image processing method is shown in <figref>FIGS. 13A-13H</figref>. <figref>FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref> display two example composite brightfield-fluorescence images at 20Ã and 100Ã magnification, respectively, which show the position of the fluorescent microbes in relation to the non-fluorescence polymer pattern. These images were used only to visualize the placement of microbes relative to the polymer pattern. <figref>FIGS. 13C and 13D</figref> show the raw fluorescence images from <figref>FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>, respectively. The raw fluorescent images were processed with ImageJ image thresholding into binary images such as those shown in <figref>FIGS. 13E and 13F</figref>. Finally, ImageJ particle analysis was performed on the binary images to provide outlines of the microbe aggregates, such as those shown in <figref>FIGS. 13G and 13H</figref>, and to generate the aggregate area data in <figref>FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>10</b>, and <b>11</b>. Three representative 20Ã fluorescent images per pattern were analyzed on each substrate. Three replicate substrates were measured. Microbes both attached to the PGMA-b-PVDMA films and attached onto the silicon regions were included in the measurement. Histogram plots with a bin size of 10 Î¼m<sup>2 </sup>were generated from this data, and all aggregates with areas &gt;300 Î¼m<sup>2 </sup>were combined into one bin.</p>

      <heading id="h-00022-en" level="1">Characterization of PGMA-b-PVDMA Films of Varied Shapes and Dimensions</heading>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0073">The formation of patterned PGMA-b-PVDMA films was achieved through lithographic patterning followed by spin-coating, annealing at 110Â° C., and wet liftoff to remove photoresist. The annealing step permitted surface attachment to occur between GMA epoxy groups and surface hydroxyl groups and also for the crosslinking of GMA groups throughout the polymer, resulting in mechanically stable films. <figref>FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> show SEM and AFM images, respectively, of films patterned as 5 Î¼m wide line arrays with a 7 Î¼m pitch. As shown in the height profiles of <figref>FIG. 8C</figref>, these films have a non-uniform cross-sectional thickness with a maximum thickness of 930Â±32 nm occurring at the film edges. This is due to the fact that the polymer covers the Ë1 Î¼m high photoresist edges during the spin coating step. A minimal film thickness of 110Â±20 nm occurs near the center of the film cross section. This thickness approaches the brush length for this copolymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0074">The SEM image, AFM image, and height profile of films patterned as square grids with a 10 Î¼m pitch are shown in <figref>FIGS. 8D-8F</figref>, respectively. As shown, the square grid arrays exhibit a similar surface topology compared to the line arrays. A maximum thickness of 860Â±80 nm was found at the film edges, and a minimal film thickness of 360Â±73 nm was measured. For line array and grid films, the average surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) from the interior PGMA-b-PVDMA pattern region was 12Â±2 nm and 9Â±4 nm, respectively. In contrast, the outer edge regions of the films contain pronounced surface topography and higher average surface roughness (R<sub>a </sub>Ë180 nm for both patterns). These outer-edge features have been shown to be most favorable for the capture of microbes after lectin functionalization. The thick, pronounced edge features also serve as physical barriers that separate PGMA-b-PVDMA regions from flat silicon regions to form a spatially confined surface environment at the length scale of a microbe (Ë1-5 Î¼m).</p>
      <heading id="h-00023-en" level="1">Microbial Adhesion on WGA-Functionalized PGMA-b-PVDMA Line Arrays</heading>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0075">To investigate the capture of <i>P. fluorescens </i>microbes over the linear PGMA-b-PVDMA patterned films, substrates were first functionalized with WGA capture lectins. WGA covalently couples to the films through addition of lysine residues onto pendant VDMA groups and also adsorbs onto silicon regions of the surface. After incubation with <i>P. fluorescens</i>, the microbes were captured in each of the patterned regions as shown in the 100Ã brightfield fluorescence images in <figref>FIGS. 9A-9E</figref>, which correspond to line arrays with a pitch of 7 Î¼m, 10 Î¼M, 15 Î¼M, 25 Î¼m, and 45 Î¼m, respectively. In contrast, control substrates containing identical patterns but that were functionalized with BSA showed no significant levels of microbe adhesion, which is consistent with previous reports and verifies affinity-based capture using WGA as opposed to non-specific surface adhesion and colonization.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0076">A comparison of the corresponding histogram plots in FIGS. <b>9</b>Aâ²-<b>9</b>Eâ² shows that there is a difference in the microbial aggregate size distribution, which depends on the degree of spatial confinement present within the line patterns. Microbes present over the lines with the smallest pitch in <figref>FIG. 9A</figref> exist predominantly as single or paired cells. This is reflected by the histogram data in FIG. <b>9</b>Aâ², showing that 79% of microbes analyzed during image analysis had less than a 20 Î¼m<sup>2 </sup>particle area while only 1% existed as large aggregates with areas greater than 100 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>. Here, microbes appear bound across the tops and on the sides of the films. However, capture is limited by restricted access to the outer-edge regions of the films, where the pronounced microscale surface topography and high surface roughness are most favorable for capture. Additionally, the topology depicted in <figref>FIG. 8A</figref> causes micron-scale surface confinement that restricts the interactions between surface-associated microbes, which limits the formation of aggregates. As the line pitch increases to 10, 15, and 25 Î¼m, incrementally larger aggregates appear on the surface, which causes incremental increases in size distribution, as shown in FIGS. <b>9</b>Bâ²-9Dâ². The increase is due to less confined access to the outer edges of the films as well as to the flat silicon-WGA regions of the surface that promote interaction between surface-associated microbes. A minor effect is noted over the last spacing step (25 to 45 Î¼m line pitch, <figref>FIGS. 9D and 9E</figref>), where microbe capture is dominated by the flat silicon-WGA surfaces with little influence from the PGMA-b-PVDMA line patterns.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0077">These results suggest that the size of captured aggregates can be tuned based on the surface topological features and underscore the importance of highly confined features (&lt;10 Î¼m) for limiting microbial aggregation during capture. Similar trends with <i>P. fluorescens </i>have been reported from Diaz, et. al. (Diaz, C., et. al., <i>Langmuir</i>, 2007, 23, pp. 11206-11210; and Diaz, C., et. al., <i>ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, </i>2009, 1, pp. 136-143.), where sub-micron lines were etched into silicon surfaces and found to restrict adhesion, aggregation, and cell motility on the surface. The ability to inhibit aggregation during microbe capture is particularly useful for assays that implement affinity-based catch-and-release of microbes for secondary genomic or proteomic analysis, which may require individual cellular isolates. For example, single cell isolation would be important to avoid changes in gene or protein expression arising from the presence of extracellular quorum sensing molecules, such as acyl-homoserine lactone, which are produced at dramatically higher levels in dense populations of Gram-negative bacteria.</p>
      <heading id="h-00024-en" level="1">Microbial Adhesion onto WGA-Functionalized PGMA-b-PVDMA Grids</heading>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0078">In an effort to further control the size distribution of captured microbes, a second dimension of spatial confinement was introduced to the patterns by formation of square grids. Similar to the line arrays, the grid pitch was systematically varied at 10, 15, 25, 45, and 85 Î¼m. Upon WGA functionalization and incubation of <i>P. fluorescens</i>, surface-associated microbes became bound to the grids, as shown in the brightfield fluorescence images of <figref>FIGS. 10A-10E</figref>, which display representative 100Ã images of grid patterns having a pitch of 10, 15, 25, 45, and 85 Î¼m, respectively. The respective aggregate size distributions are provided in FIGS. <b>10</b>Aâ²-<b>10</b>Eâ². As with the line arrays, aggregate size distribution was dependent on pitch, as patterns with smaller pitch, and thus, higher levels of confinement, reduced the formation of larger aggregates. In the case of the square grids with a 10 Î¼m pitch, 80% of microbes appear as individual or pair-wise aggregates, while only 0.45% of particles had areas greater than 100 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0079">
        <figref>FIG. 11</figref> presents a direct comparison of aggregate size distributions measured between line and grid patterns. Here, captured microbes were binned into three size categories: i) individual or paired cells (&lt;20 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>); ii) small aggregates (20-100 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>); and iii) large aggregates (&gt;100 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>), and the percentage of microbes falling within each size category is displayed. For the line arrays (<figref>FIG. 11</figref>, left), it is apparent that the fraction of large aggregates increases while the fraction of individual or paired cells decreases with increased pitch up to 45 Î¼m. Grid patterns (<figref>FIG. 11</figref>, right) show similar trends; however, the percentage of large aggregates formed over the grids is smaller compared to line arrays of the same pitch. Additionally, the influence of the PGMA-b-PVDMA film on aggregate size distribution is apparent within grids with a pitch up to 85 Î¼m. These differences are likely due to the additional dimension of spatial confinement introduced by the grids, and suggest that grid geometries are preferable for the lectin-based capture of individual microbes.</p>
      <heading id="h-00025-en" level="1">Conclusions</heading>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0080">Surfaces have herein been developed that contain microstructured, bioactive surface polymers with varied degrees of spatial confinement to control the size of microbial aggregates captured through a functional binding event. While other approaches have emphasized control of microbial surface colonization by physical structures, described in this disclosure is the novel combination of physical confinement and affinity-based capture. These substrates can be used for flow-based catch-and-release assays that functionally isolate microbe sub-populations based on EPS content while avoiding biofilm or aggregate formation on the capture surface. As a secondary utility, these surfaces should also provide a useful platform for investigating symbiotic or pathogenic relationships between isolated microbe populations of controlled sizes, ranging from pair-wise interactions to interactions within large populations, which can improve current knowledge pertaining to cell signaling and its relation to population size.</p>
