    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">An actively heated mug, travel mug, baby bottle, water bottle or liquid container is provided. The mug, travel mug, baby bottle, water bottle or liquid container can include a body that receives a liquid therein and a heating or cooling system at least partially disposed in the body. The heating or cooling system can include one or more heating or cooling elements that heat a surface of the receiving portion of the body and one or more energy storage devices. The mug, travel mug, baby bottle, water bottle or liquid container can include a wireless power receiver that wirelessly receives power from a power source and control circuitry configured to charge one or more power storage elements and to control the delivery of electricity from the one or more power storage elements to the one or more heating or cooling elements. The mug, travel mug, baby bottle, water bottle or liquid container also can have one or more sensors that sense a parameter of the liquid or sense a parameter of the heating or cooling system and communicates the sensed information to the control circuitry. The control circuitry can turn on, turn off, and/or operate the heating or cooling element to actively heat or cool at least a portion of the body to maintain the liquid in a heated or cooled state generally at a user selected temperature setting based at least in part on the sensed parameter information. The mug, travel mug, baby bottle, water bottle or liquid container can also be paired with a remote device or mobile electronic device to send or receive communications or commands.</p>

      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The invention is directed to dishware and drinkware, such as plates and mugs, and more particularly to actively heated or cooled dishware and drinkware.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Dishware (e.g., plates, bowls), serverware (e.g., platters, serving dishes, hot plates) and drinkware (e.g., cups, mugs, travel mugs, liquid containers, baby bottles, drinking bottles) are sometimes made of ceramic materials. Plates are sometimes heated by placing into an oven, so that the food on the plate can be maintained warm for a longer time than if the plate was not heated. For example, in some restaurants, plates will be heated prior to food being placed thereon, or simultaneously with the food (e.g., a steak) thereon. For example, a plate holding a steak can be placed into an oven to cook the steak, and once removed the plate maintains the food warm for a while. In some instances, a plate or bowl might also be chilled to maintain food thereon cold for a longer period of time (e.g., salad, gazpacho) than if the plate was not chilled. However, such heating and cooling mechanisms are passive mechanisms that rely on the release of heat, in the case of a heated plate, or the absorption of heat, in the case of a chilled plate, by the plate based on the heat transfer properties of the ceramic material.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">However, technology for actively heating, or cooling, dishwasher safe dishware or drinkware is not readily available. Accordingly, there is a need for dishwasher safe dishware (e.g., plates, bowls), serverware (e.g., platters, serving dishes, hot plates) and drinkware (e.g., cups, mugs, travel mugs, liquid containers, baby bottles, drinking bottles) that can be actively heated or cooled during use.</p>

Thus, the reference numerals used to designate the various components of the heated or cooled travel mug <b>600</b>â³, cup, water bottle or liquid container are identical to those used for identifying the corresponding components of the heated or cooled travel mug <b>600</b>, cup, water bottle or liquid container in <figref>FIGS. 10-12</figref>, except that a ââ³â has been added to the reference numerals.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0176">In the illustrated embodiment, the cavity <b>630</b>â³ in the heated or cooled travel mug <b>600</b>â³, cup, water bottle or liquid container can be subdivided by a base <b>614</b>â³ of the outer cylindrical wall <b>610</b>â³ and an adjacent top wall <b>616</b>â³ into a first cavity <b>630</b><i>a</i>â³ between the bottom portion <b>640</b>â³ and the top wall <b>616</b>â³ and a second cavity <b>630</b><i>b</i>â³ between the base <b>614</b>â³ of the outer cylindrical wall <b>610</b>â³ and the annular gap <b>628</b>â³. The energy storage devices <b>680</b> and electronic module <b>690</b> are disposed in the first cavity <b>630</b><i>a</i>â³. In the illustrated embodiment, the second cavity <b>630</b><i>b</i>â³ is under a vacuum, which advantageously further thermally insulates the energy storage devices <b>680</b> and electronic module <b>690</b> from the heating or cooling element <b>660</b>. Additionally, having the second cavity <b>630</b><i>b</i>â³ under a vacuum advantageously allows the inner surface <b>620</b><i>b </i>of the inner circumferential wall <b>620</b> to maintain its temperature for a longer period of time, and therefore maintain the temperature of the liquid in the chamber C for a longer period of time, as the vacuum in the second cavity <b>630</b><i>b</i>â³ inhibits heat transfer through the outer cylindrical wall <b>610</b>â³ and base <b>614</b>â³. In the illustrated embodiment, the heating or cooling element <b>660</b> can be electrically connected to the one or more energy storage devices <b>680</b> and the electronic module <b>690</b> with a connector (e.g., one or more wires, or a trace line printed on the side wall <b>620</b><i>a</i>â³, <b>610</b><i>a</i>â³ of the inner and outer circumferential walls <b>610</b>â³, <b>620</b>) (not shown) that extends between the first and second cavities <b>630</b><i>a</i>â³, <b>630</b><i>b</i>â³. This vacuum arrangement can also be incorporated into any other drinkware, dishware or serverware devices, such as the plate <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>â², <b>800</b>, <b>800</b>â², <b>1100</b>, <b>1300</b>, <b>1400</b>, mug <b>400</b>, cup, baby bottle <b>1500</b>, water bottle or liquid container discussed below.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0177">In one embodiment, the heating or cooling system <b>55</b>, <b>455</b>, <b>655</b> is embedded or housed in the body of the dishware device (e.g., plate <b>100</b>, mug <b>400</b>, travel mug <b>600</b>, etc.). In another embodiment, the heating or cooling system <b>55</b>, <b>455</b>, <b>655</b> can be housed in a closed water-resistant or water-proof compartment, such as the cavity <b>50</b>, <b>450</b>, <b>630</b> disposed in a recess of the dishware device. For example, in one embodiment the compartment can be disposed in said recess such that a surface of the compartment is flush with the surrounding surface of the dishware device. In another embodiment, the compartment can protrude from a surface of the dishware device. In one embodiment, the water resistant or water-proof compartment can be removably disposed in said recess of the dishware device (e.g., the compartment can be removably attachable to the dishware, drinkware or serverware device). In another embodiment, the water resistant or water-proof compartment can be fixed within said recess (e.g., attached to the dishware device within the recess via an adhesive, screws, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0178">As discussed above, in one embodiment power can be transmitted wirelessly from a wireless power transmitter, such as the power transmitter <b>240</b>, <b>540</b>, to a wireless power receiver, such as the power receiver <b>92</b>, <b>492</b>, <b>692</b>, via short-distance wireless energy transfer, such as inductive coupling. In another embodiment, the wireless power receiver <b>92</b>, <b>492</b>, <b>692</b> of the heated or cooled dishware and drinkware, such as the mug <b>400</b>, plate <b>100</b>, bowl or serving dish and travel mug <b>600</b>, can receive power from a remote transmitter via long-distance wireless energy transmission, so that a charging base need not be used to transmit power to the heated or cooled dishware and drinkware.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0179">In one embodiment, the remote transmitter can be disposed on a wall or ceiling of a home or restaurant, or can be disposed outside the home or restaurant. The transmitter can wirelessly transmit power over a distance of a few to several meters to the wireless power receiver <b>92</b>, <b>492</b>, <b>692</b> using resonant inductive coupling. In one embodiment, an inductive coil in the remote transmitter can have a capacitance plate attached to each end of the coil wire. As electricity travels through the coil, the coil can resonate with a resonant frequency that is a product of the inductance of the coil and the capacitance of the plates. The wireless power receiver, such as the wireless power receiver <b>92</b>, <b>492</b>, <b>692</b>, can have a similar inductive coil with the same resonant frequency as the inductive coil in the remote transmitter, so that energy can be transmitted from the transmitter to the wireless power receiver <b>92</b>, <b>492</b>, <b>692</b>. Accordingly, the heated or cooled dishware or drinkware, such as the mug <b>400</b>, plate <b>100</b>, bowl or serving dish and travel mug <b>600</b>, cup, water bottle or liquid container can be powered wirelessly without the use of a charging base. [0143] In use, a user can charge the one or more energy storage devices, such as the energy storage devices <b>80</b>, <b>480</b>, <b>680</b>, via the charging base and/or the remote transmitter. Once charged, the dishware or drinkware can be heated or cooled via the heating or cooling element <b>60</b>, <b>460</b>, <b>660</b> thereof to maintain food or liquids therein warm or chilled, as the case may be, for a prolonged period of time. Additionally, since the heating or cooling system <b>55</b>, <b>455</b>, <b>655</b> is disposed (e.g., embedded) in the body of the dishware or drinkware, such as the mug <b>400</b>, plate <b>100</b>, bowl or serving dish or travel mug <b>600</b>, the dishware and drinkware can be exposed to water (e.g., in a sink or dishwasher) while inhibiting damage to the heating or cooling system <b>55</b>, <b>455</b>, <b>655</b>. In another embodiment, as discussed above, the heating or cooling system <b>55</b>, <b>455</b>, <b>655</b> can be housed in a closed water resistant or water-proof compartment, where said compartment is fixed or removably attachable to the dishware device (e.g., mug <b>400</b>, plate <b>100</b>, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0180">In one embodiment, the dishware or drinkware device (e.g., plate <b>100</b>, bowl, serving dish, mug <b>400</b>, travel mug <b>600</b>, cup, water bottle or liquid container) can include an orientation sensor (e.g., gyro) that senses the orientation of the dishware or drinkware device, and communicates with the electronic module <b>90</b>, <b>490</b>, <b>690</b> to control the operation of the dishware or drinkware device. For example, the gyro can sense when the plate <b>100</b>, bowl or serving dish has been turned on its side or when the mug <b>400</b>, cup, water bottle, liquid container or travel mug <b>600</b> have been turned upside down (e.g., when loading into a dishwasher) and communicates a signal to the electronic module <b>90</b>, <b>490</b>, <b>690</b> to discontinue power to the heating or cooling element <b>60</b>, <b>460</b>, <b>660</b>, thereby turning the heating or cooling element off. However, other suitable devices (e.g., sensors) other than a gyro can be used to sense the orientation of the dishware, drinkware or serverware device, such as the plate <b>100</b>, mug <b>400</b>, cup, water bottle, liquid container or travel mug <b>600</b>. In another embodiment, the dishware or drinkware device (e.g. plate <b>100</b>, bowl, serving dish, mug <b>400</b>, travel mug <b>600</b>, cup, water bottle or liquid container) can have one or more accelerometer sensors which can sense changes in velocity or changes in motion or in orientation of the dishware or drinkware.</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0181">In one embodiment, the orientation (or tilt) sensor can sense when the plate <b>100</b>, bowl or serving dish is tilted more than a certain predetermined amount (e.g., more than) 45Â° from the horizontal axis, and the electronic module <b>90</b> turns off power to the heating or cooling system <b>55</b> (e.g., to the heating or cooling element <b>60</b>) and disables user interface buttons (discussed further below) on the plate <b>100</b>, bowl or serving dish. The plate <b>100</b>, bowl or serving dish can then be inserted into a dishwasher for cleaning. The user interface buttons can be enabled once the plate <b>100</b>, bowl or serving dish is placed back on the charging station, such as the charging stand <b>300</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0182">In another embodiment, the orientation (or tilt) sensor can sense when the mug <b>400</b>, cup, water bottle, liquid container or travel mug <b>600</b> is tilted by more than a certain predetermined amount (e.g., more than 135Â°) from the upright vertical axis, and the electronic module <b>490</b>, <b>690</b> turns off power to the heating or cooling system <b>455</b>, <b>655</b> (e.g., to the heating or cooling element <b>460</b>, <b>660</b>) and disables user interface buttons and sensors (such as liquid sensors or liquid level sensors, discussed further below) on the mug <b>400</b>, cup, water bottle, liquid container or travel mug <b>600</b>. The mug <b>400</b>, cup, water bottle, liquid container or travel mug <b>600</b> can then be inserted into a dishwasher for cleaning. The user interface buttons can be enabled once the mug <b>400</b>, cup, water bottle, liquid container or travel mug <b>600</b> is returned to a right side up orientation, and the mug <b>400</b>, cup, water bottle, liquid container or travel mug <b>600</b> can again be operated by selecting the âonâ button thereon, or by placing the mug <b>400</b>, cup, water bottle, liquid container or travel mug <b>600</b> back on its associated charging stand <b>500</b>, <b>700</b> and thereafter removing it, which resets the operation of the electronic module <b>490</b>, <b>690</b>.</p>

      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0185">In one embodiment, the electronic module <b>90</b>, <b>490</b>, <b>690</b> of the plate <b>100</b>, mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> (or bowl, serving dish, cup, water bottle or liquid container) can automatically turn off power to the heating or cooling element <b>60</b>, <b>460</b>, <b>660</b> (e.g., via the control circuitry <b>94</b>, <b>494</b>, <b>694</b>), when a predetermined level of the one or more electrical energy storage devices <b>80</b>, <b>480</b>, <b>680</b> (e.g., batteries) is detected. For example, if the charge or electrical energy storage level of the one or more electrical energy storage devices <b>80</b>, <b>480</b>, <b>680</b> is below a predetermined percentage of an amount corresponding to a full charge, the electronic module <b>90</b>, <b>490</b>, <b>690</b> can shut-off power to the heating or cooling element <b>60</b>, <b>460</b>, <b>960</b> to inhibit damage to the electrical energy storage devices <b>80</b>, <b>480</b>, <b>680</b> or other components of the plate <b>100</b>, mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> (or bowl, serving dish, cup, water bottle or liquid container).

      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0190">Operation Based on Food Detection</p>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0191">In one embodiment, the plate <b>100</b>, bowl or serving dish can have a have one or more sensors (such as sensors <b>820</b>A-<b>820</b>D in <figref>FIG. 16</figref>) that sense when food has been placed on the plate, bowl or serving dish and sends a signal to the electronic module <b>90</b> (e.g., sends a signal to the controller circuit <b>94</b>) to control the operation of the heating or cooling element <b>60</b> based at least in part on the signal. For example, the electronic module <b>90</b> can turn on the heating or cooling element <b>60</b> upon receiving the signal that food has been placed on the plate <b>100</b>, bowl or serving dish. In one embodiment, the sensor can be a weight sensor. In one embodiment, the sensor can be a pressure sensor. In one embodiment, the sensor can be a liquid sensor. In one embodiment, the sensor can be a proximity sensor. In one embodiment, the sensor can be an optical sensor. In one embodiment, the sensor can be a near field sensor. In one embodiment, the sensor can sense a change in resonant frequency when food is placed on the plate, bowl or serving dish. For example, a component of the plate <b>100</b>, bowl or serving dish can transmit or broadcast a signal at a standard frequency and the sensor can sense a change or shift in the frequency of the signal (e.g., ultrasound type detection). In one embodiment, the frequency can be above or below an inductive coupling frequency (e.g., above or below about 100-120 kHz). For example, in one embodiment, the broadcast frequency of the signal can be about 40-50 kHz. In an embodiment where the sensor is an optical sensor, the plate <b>100</b>, bowl or serving dish can act as an optical filter and the optical signal can be transmitted through the plate, bowl or serving dish. In such an embodiment, the sensor would sense a modulated signal, relative to the set optical signal, which would indicate the presence of food on the plate <b>100</b>. In another embodiment, the sensor could be a temperature sensor (such as sensors <b>820</b>A-<b>820</b>D in <figref>FIG. 16</figref>), which could detect a change in temperature (due to placement of food on the plate <b>100</b>, bowl or serving dish), to thereby sense the presence of food on the plate <b>100</b>, bowl or serving dish. Any combination of the above sensing techniques can be used to enhance the food detection capabilities of the plate <b>100</b>, bowl or serving dish.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0192">Similarly, the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> (or cup, water bottle or liquid container) can have a sensor, or combination of sensors such as the sensors discussed above, to sense when liquid is present within the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b>, cup, water bottle or liquid container. In one embodiment, when the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> is removed from its associated charging station <b>500</b>, <b>700</b> or inductive coupling power pad, the electronic module <b>490</b>, <b>690</b> can place the mug <b>400</b> and travel mug <b>600</b> in standby mode and activate the liquid sensor. In one embodiment, the liquid sensor can be located at a bottom inner surface of the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b>, or at a distance from the bottom surface of the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> (e.g., at Â½ inch or 1 inch from the bottom along the inner side surface, though other locations are possible). Once liquid is poured into the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b>, the liquid sensor can sense the liquid (e.g., via sensing of a change in temperature, weight, pressure, electrical conductivity, electrical continuity, electrical resistance between two conductors, change in frequency detection, optical sensor, or any combination of sensors above) and turn on the heating or cooling system <b>455</b>, <b>655</b> (e.g., after liquid has been sensed for a predetermined period of time, such as 2 seconds, or substantially instantaneously if desired, such as within less than 0.1 sec or 0.1 msec of sensing. In one embodiment, the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> can have a visual indicator or screen (e.g., digital screen) that can be activated upon turning on of the heating or cooling system <b>455</b>, <b>655</b> (e.g., illustrating an illuminated logo, or temperature mode, or displaying the temperature of the liquid, etc.). In another embodiment, the visual indicator can be an illuminated logo or icon or can be a simple indicator light which tells the user that the heating or cooling system <b>455</b>, <b>655</b> has been activated. Once on, the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> can operate the heating or cooling element <b>460</b>, <b>660</b> at a predetermined user selected temperature (e.g., the temperature selected by the user the last time the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> was used, or a new temperature that the user has selected). The user can change the power level setting or temperature setting via one or more buttons (e.g., soft touch, touch switch, dial, push-button, touch pad, etc.) on a user interface of the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b>, cup, water bottle or liquid container. In another embodiment, the power level or temperature setting can be adjusted using a dial, a switch, a gesture sensor, or any other type of user-interface mechanism in communication with the electronic module <b>490</b>, <b>690</b>. In one embodiment, the user-interface display on the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> can warn a user if the liquid within the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> is too hot to consume or is above or below a predetermined temperature (e.g., the user's preferred or selected temperature).</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0193">The heating or cooling system <b>455</b> or <b>655</b> of the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> can be configured to turn off once the liquid sensor (or combination of sensors) senses that the liquid inside the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> has been depleted to a predetermined level or depleted completely. Once liquid is again poured into the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> so that the sensor (or combination of sensors) senses the poured liquid, the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> can again be operated as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0194">Additionally, the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> can have one or more liquid level sensors for detecting a liquid level in the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b>, cup, water bottle or liquid container. The one or more liquid level sensors can be of the type discussed above (e.g., sensing a change in temperature, weight, pressure, electrical conductivity, electrical continuity, electrical resistance between two conductors, frequency detection such as ultrasound frequency detection, change in frequency, optical sensor, or any combination above) and can communicate sensed information to the electronic module <b>490</b>, <b>690</b>, which can transmit information to one or more indicators (e.g., visual indicators or audible indicator, such as a sound, or a vibration) on the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> to indicate to the user the amount of liquid left in the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b>, cup, water bottle or liquid container (or that the liquid in the cup, mug, or travel mug is at, above, or below, the user preferred drinking temperature). In one embodiment, the liquid level sensor can be used in combination with the orientation sensor (e.g. gyro) so that the liquid level within the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> will only be taken when the mug <b>400</b> or travel mug <b>600</b> is in the upright position. This technique would advantageously avoid the improper reading of the liquid level when the user tilts the mug off of vertical axis to take a drink. In one embodiment, the one or more liquid level sensors can communicate signals to the electronic module <b>490</b>, <b>690</b>, allowing the electronic module <b>490</b>, <b>690</b> to determine if the mug <b>400</b>, travel mug <b>600</b>, cup, water bottle or liquid container has been tilted. Accordingly, the one or more liquid level sensors can operate as orientation sensors to sense an orientation of the mug <b>400</b>, travel mug <b>600</b>, cup, water bottle or liquid container.</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0195">In one embodiment, the cup, mug <b>400</b>, travel mug <b>600</b>, <b>1700</b>A, <b>2000</b>, <b>2100</b>, <b>2400</b>, water bottle or liquid container (such as beer mug <b>1600</b>, baby bottle <b>1500</b>) can have one or more liquid level sensors (e.g. ultrasound sensors, as discussed above). In one embodiment, the cup, mug <b>400</b>, travel mug <b>600</b>, <b>1700</b>A, <b>2000</b>, <b>2100</b>, <b>2400</b>, water bottle or liquid container (such as beer mug <b>1600</b>, baby bottle <b>1500</b>) can have a plurality of liquid level sensors (e.g., disposed at various vertical locations of the sidewall, such as sidewall SW in <figref>FIG. 34A</figref>). In one embodiment, the one or more liquid level sensors can communicate liquid level information to the electronic module (such as electronic module EM, see <figref>FIG. 44</figref>), and the electronic module can operate the one or more heating or cooling elements (e.g., see HC in <figref>FIG. 44</figref>) based at least in part on said sensed level information. For example, in one embodiment the electronic module could turn on, turn off or adjust power to at least one of the one or more heating or cooling elements based at least in part on said sensed level information.</p>

In the illustrated embodiment, the liquid level sensor can optionally be excluded, and the heating and cooling element HC can be operated independent of the liquid level in the chamber. In another embodiment, only a portion of the sidewall SWâ² of the liquid holding chamber H is thermally conductive (e.g. thermally conductive bands or belts can wrap around the outer circumference of the liquid holding chamber H, or in another example, certain areas of the liquid holding chamber H can be thermally conductive and other areas may not be). In one embodiment, a cooling element HC<b>6</b> can be operated to cool at least a portion of the side walls SWâ² around the perimeter of a liquid chamber and can lower the temperature of the liquid nearest to the side walls. In this embodiment the liquid along the side walls becomes colder than that liquid in the remaining body of liquid and will fall in a downwards direction along the sidewall of the liquid holding chamber H. This can advantageously induce a circulation effect, circulating the liquid within the liquid container LC<b>5</b>. This circulation effect can be used to stir or mix the liquid within the liquid container for the sake of discouraging more buoyant particles from separating from less buoyant particles, or the circulation effect can be used to keep the temperature of the liquid within the liquid container LC<b>5</b> substantially uniform. In another embodiment (not shown in the illustration), one or more heating elements can be added to the above embodiment and can be in thermal contact with a base or a bottom of the liquid holding chamber H. In this embodiment, the heating element can be operated to heat at least a portion of the liquid near the center of the liquid chamber, at the base, so that it can further support the rise of hotter liquid up the center of the body of liquid (this would further strengthen the circulation effect).</p>

In this embodiment, when the cup, mug, travel mug, coffee carafe, water bottle or liquid container is placed in the receiving area of the coffee making machine, and the wireless power transmitter of the machine is turned on, the cup, mug, travel mug, coffee carafe, water bottle or liquid container can use its thermostat circuit to control the pre-heating process at a user selected or predetermined temperature or temperature range. This embodiment can have a user interface, or can exclude a user-interface and rely on a factory set temperature or temperature range. In another embodiment, similar to the above embodiment, instead of using a thermostat circuit, said cup, mug, travel mug, coffee carafe, water bottle or liquid container can have a wireless power receiver, a power limiting device (i.e. current limiter, voltage limiter or wattage limiter), and heating or cooling elements (e.g., a heater coil). In this embodiment, when the cup, mug, travel mug, coffee carafe, water bottle or liquid container is placed in the receiving area of the coffee making machine, and the wireless power transmitter of the coffee making machine is turned on, the cup, mug, travel mug, coffee carafe, water bottle or liquid container can use its power limiting device to control the pre-heating temperature at a user selected or predetermined temperature or temperature range. This embodiment can have a user interface, or can exclude a user-interface and rely on a factory predetermined temperature or temperature range. In another embodiment, said cup, mug, travel mug, coffee carafe, water bottle or liquid container can have a wireless power receiver and one or more heating or cooling elements. In this embodiment, the user can select a pre-heat temperature or pre-heat temperature range (e.g. âlowâ or âmediumâ or âhighâ) for said cup, mug, travel mug, coffee carafe, water bottle or liquid container via a user interface located on the coffee making machine. In this embodiment, the coffee making machine can limit or control the power level of its wireless power transmitter (based on the user-selected temperature or temperature range), so as to control the amount of power delivered to the wireless power receiver within the cup, mug, travel mug, coffee carafe, water bottle or liquid container. In this embodiment the coffee making machine can use a voltage limiter or an amperage limiter or a wattage limiter or can slowly modulate or pulse the power or use pulse width modulation (PWM) (e.g., pulsing of power at a high frequency) to adjust the power level provided by the wireless power transmitter in the coffee making machine to the wireless power receive in the cup, mug, travel mug, carafe, water bottle or liquid container, and thereby adjust the power provided to the one or more heating or cooling elements (e.g., heater coil) of the cup, mug, travel mug, carafe, water bottle or liquid container. In this manner, a specific power level can be provided to the one or more heating or cooling elements in order to heat or cool the liquid holding portion of the cup, mug, travel mug, carafe, water bottle or liquid container to a specific temperature or temperature range (e.g., low, medium, high). This embodiment advantageously allows the user to select a pre-heat temperature or pre-heat temperature range for the cup, mug, travel mug, coffee carafe, water bottle or liquid container directly on the coffee maker machine, and the manufacturing costs for the cup, mug, travel mug, coffee carafe, water bottle or liquid container can be reduced due to the reduced number of components within the cup, mug, travel mug, coffee carafe, water bottle or liquid container. This embodiment can have a user interface on the coffee machine (as described above), or can exclude a user-interface and rely on a factory predetermined temperature or temperature range. In another embodiment, the cup, mug, travel mug, coffee carafe, water bottle or liquid container can have a temperature sensor, a wireless transmitter for transmitting data, one or more heating or cooling elements and a wireless power receiver. In this embodiment, the temperature sensor can transmit sensed temperature information to the coffee maker, so that the coffee maker can regulate the power level that is delivered to the cup, mug, travel mug, coffee carafe, water bottle or liquid container, at least in part based on said sensed information received from the temperature sensor. In this embodiment, the coffee maker machine can regulate power to its wireless power transmitter in order to control the temperature of at least a portion of the liquid receiving portion of the cup, mug, travel mug, coffee carafe, water bottle or liquid container. Although the machine described in the above embodiments is a coffee making machine, the above embodiments can work with a tea making machine, or coffee and tea making machine, or other hot or cold liquid dispensing machines.</p>

      <p id="p-00282-en" num="0282">In one embodiment, the information stored on the cloud can be communicated to social networking sites, e.g., by the user, to share information (e.g., progress in reducing coffee intake, or sharing the user's favorite type of coffee or tea drinks, or the user's daily coffee or tea drinking habits, etc.) with the user's social network.</p>
      <p id="p-00283-en" num="0283">RFID Tag</p>
      <p id="p-00284-en" num="0284">In one embodiment, the cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container can have an RFID tag. In this embodiment, user data can be transmitted via the RFID tag to an RFID reader at a coffee shop, tea shop, coffee cafÃ©, cafÃ©, grocery store, food &amp; beverage location, or other retail location. The RFID tag can communicate certain data, such as the user's favorite coffee or tea drink, or the user's drinking habits, or what coffee and/or tea shops the user has visited, or what other retail locations the user has visited, or what temperature the user prefers to keep his or her coffee or tea drink. In another embodiment, the RFID tag can receive information from the retail location (e.g., the RFID tag can receive information on the specific coffee or tea purchased, such as where it was grown, etc.), and such information can be displayed to the user (e.g., via a visual display on the cup, mug, travel mug, carafe, water bottle or liquid container). In another embodiment, the RFID tag within the cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container can be used to pay for the beverage, food or merchandise that the user chooses to purchase. In this embodiment, the RFID tag within the cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container can communicate with an RFID reader of the coffee shop, tea shop, coffee cafÃ©, cafÃ©, grocery store, food &amp; beverage location or other retail location, and can communicate the user's identification information, or account information, or credit card information, or bank account information, or credit account information (e.g. such as a coffee shop credit account or coffee shop pre-paid account, or a credit account or pre-paid account of another suitable type). In this embodiment, the user can use his or her cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container to pay for food, beverage or other merchandise. In another embodiment, the RFID tag within the cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container can be used as part of a customer loyalty rewards program. As an example, the coffee shop, tea shop, coffee cafÃ©, grocery store, food &amp; beverage location or other retail location can reward the user a free cup of coffee or tea for every 10 cups of coffee or tea that the user purchases. Each time the user purchases a cup of coffee or tea, the RFID tag can communicate said information to an RFID reader, or the purchasing data can be stored on the RFID tag, or within other data storage circuitry inside the cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container, or on a cloud based data storage system, or a local or remote data storage system. Although the example given above states one free cup of coffee or tea for every ten cups of coffee or tea purchased, other rewards programs can be used (e.g. food, beverage, merchandise, rewards points, reward dollars, dollars, currency, etc. can be extended to the customer in exchange for total amount of coffee or tea consumed or purchased by the customer, or certain types of coffee or tea purchased by the customer, or a reward points system, or other beverages purchased, or total amount of dollars spent, or number of times per day, month, or year the costumer makes purchases, or any other suitable rewards program can be used). In one embodiment, the reward points, or rewards dollars, or other reward program information can be displayed on the user's cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container via a display screen or can be displayed on the user's mobile electronic device, or cell phone, or tablet or on the cloud, or on the user's dashboard, or on a website or on a mobile phone or tablet application, etc. In another embodiment, the RFID tag within the cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container can communicate information to an RFID reader within a coffee shop, tea shop, coffee cafÃ©, cafÃ©, grocery store, food &amp; beverage location or other retail location for the purposes of accumulating data that can be used to calculate the approximate or exact amount of paper cups or disposable cups not used or number of trees saved, etc. In this embodiment, as an example, when the user uses his or her cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container to consume a purchased beverage, a disposable cup has been saved (i.e. not used). This user data can be collected and can be transmitted via the RFID tag and ultimately can be displayed on the user's cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container via a display screen or can be displayed on the user's mobile electronic device, or cell phone, or tablet, or on the user's internet dashboard, or on a website or on a mobile phone or tablet application, or on a social media website or app, or on a screen inside or outside the coffee shop, tea shop, coffee cafÃ©, cafÃ©, grocery store, food &amp; beverage location or other retail location, etc. (e.g. total number or approximate total number of trees saved, or total number of disposable cups saved or not used, or total carbon footprint offset, or other suitable green or eco initiative information). In this embodiment, the information can be single user information (e.g. how many disposal cups the user has independently saved) or the data collection can be cumulative and can include data from a group of users or all users, etc. (e.g., total number or approximate total number of disposable cups saved, or trees saved, or carbon footprint offset, across all users of said RFID tag enabled cups, mugs, travel mugs, water bottles or liquid containers). In another embodiment, the user's data can be collected and displayed directly on a screen of the user's cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container or can be displayed on a screen of the user's mobile phone or mobile electronic device via Bluetooth pairing (e.g. how many disposal cups the user has independently saved or the number of trees saved, or total carbon footprint offset, etc.) and in this embodiment the use of transmitted user data (e.g. RFID tag) would not be necessary. Although the embodiments described in this paragraph use an RFID tag and RFID reader to communicate data, other suitable methods of wireless communication can be used to transmit said data (e.g. the cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container can communicate said data via a WiFi connection, or via a Bluetooth radio, or via ZigBee radio, or via near field communication (NFC), or any other suitable RF, Infrared or ultrasound transmitter or receiver). In one embodiment, multiple stages of communications can lead to the data arriving in a targeted location (e.g. a Bluetooth radio of the cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container can transmit certain data to a mobile electronic device (via Bluetooth paring) and the mobile electronic device can relay or transmit said data to the internet via its cellular or WiFi connection to the internet).</p>
      <p id="p-00285-en" num="0285">In another embodiment, the data described in this paragraph above can be transmitted to the coffee shop, tea shop, coffee cafÃ©, cafÃ©, grocery store, food &amp; beverage location or other retail location via a QR code that is displayed on a screen of the user's cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container (e.g. the user can pay for beverage, food or merchandise via the use of a QR code that is displayed on a screen of the user's cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container, or a user can transmit reward points information, or identification information, or any other information, as outlined in this paragraph above, via a QR code on a screen of the user's cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container). In another embodiment, said QR code can be displayed on a mobile phone, or mobile electronic device via a wireless transmission of data from the cup, mug, travel mug, water bottle or liquid container to the user's mobile phone or mobile electronic device.

      <p id="p-00319-en" num="0319">The travel mug <b>2100</b> can be a double walled unit with an inner wall <b>2120</b> and an outer wall <b>2110</b>. The base <b>2126</b> of the inner wall <b>2120</b> can have one or more portions <b>2126</b><i>c </i>that can contact one or more portions <b>2110</b><i>c </i>of a base <b>2110</b><i>b </i>of the outer wall <b>2110</b>. A temperature sensor (e.g., thermistor, thermostat) can be connected to the one or more portions <b>2110</b><i>c </i>of the base <b>2110</b><i>b </i>to thereby provide a temperature reading of the temperature in the cavity <b>2118</b>. The temperature sensor can communicate with the electronic module <b>2190</b>, which can communicate the sensed temperature information as discussed herein (e.g., communicate it to a user interface of the travel mug <b>2100</b>, communicate it to an electronic device, such as a mobile electronic device, via the cloud or a Bluetooth connection). This embodiment advantageously allows obtaining of temperature information from the cavity <b>2118</b> in a double walled travel mug <b>2100</b> (e.g., a vacuum sealed mug) without the need to extend wiring through a vacuum chamber in the gap <b>2128</b> and without the use of a spacer between the inner wall <b>2120</b> and the outer wall <b>2110</b><i>a</i>. In one embodiment, the inner wall <b>2120</b> and surface <b>2110</b><i>a </i>are part of a single piece (e.g., monolithic piece) that can be inserted into the body of the travel mug <b>2100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00320-en" num="0320">In another embodiment, the contact between the one or more portions <b>2126</b><i>c </i>of the inner wall <b>2100</b> and one or more portions <b>2110</b><i>c </i>of the outer wall <b>2110</b> can alternatively (or additionally) serve as a sound bridge and allow the sensing of liquid volume or level within the cavity <b>2118</b>. For example, a sound generator (e.g., an ultrasound generator) can be coupled to the outer surface of the outer wall <b>2110</b><i>c </i>adjacent one of said contacting one or more portions <b>2126</b><i>c </i>of the inner wall <b>2126</b> and one or more portions <b>2110</b><i>c </i>of the outer wall <b>2110</b><i>b </i>and generate a signal (e.g., a vibration signal) that can be communicated into the liquid in the cavity <b>2118</b>. A microphone (e.g., an ultrasound microphone) can be coupled to an outer surface of the outer wall <b>2110</b><i>c </i>adjacent another of said contacting one or more portions <b>2126</b><i>c </i>of the inner wall <b>2126</b> and one or more portions <b>2110</b><i>c </i>of the outer wall <b>2110</b><i>b </i>and communicate a signal to the electronic module <b>2190</b>, which could determine a volume (or level) of liquid in the cavity <b>2118</b> based on a comparison of the frequency of the signal generated by the sound generator and the frequency received by the microphone.</p>
      <p id="p-00321-en" num="0321">In still another option, not shown, the one or more portions <b>2126</b><i>c </i>can have an opening defined by an edge that can be coupled (e.g., welded) to the one or more portions <b>2110</b><i>c </i>of the outer wall <b>2110</b><i>b </i>such that the temperature or liquid volume/level sensors can be attached to an outer surface of the outer wall <b>2110</b><i>b </i>and so their signals need only pass through the single wall.</p>
      <p id="p-00322-en" num="0322">Though the temperature and/or liquid sensing disclosed above may be described in connection with a travel mug <b>2000</b>, <b>2100</b>, one of skill in the art will recognize that it can also apply to any liquid container, drinkware, dishware or serverware (e.g., bowl, serving dish, hot plate), including the plate <b>100</b>â², <b>800</b>, <b>800</b>â², <b>900</b>, <b>1100</b>, <b>1300</b>, <b>1400</b>, cup, mug <b>400</b>, travel mug <b>600</b>, <b>1700</b>A, <b>2400</b>, beer mug <b>1600</b>, baby bottle <b>1500</b>, bread basket <b>2200</b>, tortilla warmer <b>2300</b>, etc. and the scope of disclosure and the invention is understood to cover such liquid containers, drinkware, dishware and serverware.</p>

      <p id="p-00327-en" num="0327">Electric Hand Warmer</p>
      <p id="p-00328-en" num="0328">
        <figref>FIG. 43</figref> shows one embodiment of a mug <b>2400</b> with an electric hand warmer <b>2410</b>. The mug <b>2400</b> can have some or all of the same features as discussed above for the mug <b>400</b>, or travel mug <b>600</b>, <b>1700</b>A, <b>2100</b>, <b>2200</b>, including a heating or cooling system with one or more heating or cooling elements, an electronic module (with a wireless power receiver, control circuitry, and optionally charging circuitry), and optionally one or more power storage devices (e.g., batteries, capacitors). In the illustrated embodiment, the hand warmer <b>2410</b> can have one or more heating elements <b>2412</b> on an outer surface <b>2414</b> of the mug <b>2400</b> or a handle (not shown) of the mug <b>2400</b>, where the one or more heating elements <b>2412</b> (e.g., heater wire, thermoelectric elements, resistive heaters, etc.) can be activated (e.g., selectively activated or automatically activated) to warm an outer surface <b>2414</b> of the mug <b>2400</b>, so that the user's hands can be warmed as the user holds the mug <b>2400</b>. The one or more heating elements <b>2412</b> can in one embodiment be distributed around a portion of the outside circumference of the mug <b>2400</b> and attached to, coupled to, embedded in or otherwise incorporated in an outer surface <b>2414</b> of the mug <b>2400</b> (e.g., disposed beneath an outer layer of the mug <b>2400</b>). In another embodiment, the one or more heating elements can be elsewhere within the mug or travel mug and can be in thermal communication with an outer surface <b>2410</b> of the mug or travel mug (e.g. the heat energy can be conducted to the outer surface from a heat source located anywhere within the mug or travel mug).</p>
      <p id="p-00329-en" num="0329">In one embodiment, the heat generated from the heating or cooling system within the mug (i.e. the heating or cooling system that actively heats or cools the liquid within the mug or travel mug) can be used to conduct heat to a hand warmer feature (e.g. the heat energy from the heating or cooling system can be conducted to an outer surface <b>2410</b> of the mug or travel mug and act as a hand warmer feature). The hand warmer <b>2410</b> can in one embodiment be automatically activated (e.g., via the control circuitry of the mug <b>2400</b>) when the mug <b>2400</b> is used, such as when a liquid is poured into the mug <b>2400</b> (e.g., when the presence of liquid is sensed, as discussed in embodiments herein). In another embodiment, the hand warmer <b>2410</b> can be selectively actuated (e.g., turned on, off, or to selected temperature set points such as high, medium, low, or a specific temperature) by the user via a user interface (such as the user interface <b>695</b>, <b>1710</b>A) on the mug <b>2400</b>, which communicates the user's instructions to the control circuitry of the mug <b>2400</b>. In still another embodiment, the hand warmer <b>2410</b> can be selectively actuated (e.g., turned on, off, or to selected temperature set points such as high, medium, low, or a specific temperature) by the user via a user interface on an electronic device (e.g., mobile electronic device such as the mobile phone <b>1750</b>A) that communicates with the mug <b>2400</b> (e.g., communicates with the control circuitry of the mug <b>2400</b>) via the cloud or a Bluetooth connection. In yet another embodiment, a temperature sensor on the mug <b>2400</b> (e.g., on an outer surface of the mug <b>2400</b>) can sense the ambient temperature and actuate (e.g., automatically actuate via the control circuitry) the hand warmer <b>2410</b> if the sensed ambient temperature is below a predetermined set point or range. In one embodiment, operation of the hand warmer <b>2410</b> can be powered by one or more power storage devices (e.g., batteries, capacitors, etc.). In one embodiment, a mug or travel mug can have an electric hand warmer feature, one or more power storage elements (to power the hand warmer) and control circuitry (to turn on or off the hand warmer, or to control certain preset temperature set points, etc.). In this embodiment, a user interface can optionally be included, which can allow the user to select certain hand warmer operation modes, or temperature modes, or other settings that effect the operation of the hand warmer feature.</p>
      <p id="p-00330-en" num="0330">Though the electric hand warmer disclosed above may be described in connection with a mug <b>2400</b>, one of skill in the art will recognize that it can also apply to any liquid container, drinkware, dishware or serverware (e.g., bowl, serving dish, hot plate), including the plate <b>100</b>â², <b>800</b>, <b>800</b>â², <b>900</b>, <b>1100</b>, <b>1300</b>, <b>1400</b>, mug <b>400</b>, travel mug <b>600</b>, <b>1700</b>A, <b>2000</b>, <b>2100</b>, <b>2400</b>, beer mug <b>1600</b>, baby bottle <b>1500</b>, bread basket <b>2200</b>, tortilla warmer <b>2300</b>, and the scope of disclosure and the invention is understood to cover such liquid containers, drinkware, dishware and serverware.</p>

The lid <b>2600</b> can have a magnetic coupling mechanism <b>2610</b> for releasing the cover from the closed position. In one embodiment, the magnetic coupling mechanism <b>2610</b> can be manually actuated by the user (e.g., by pushing a button <b>2620</b>) to release the cover from the closed position by moving (e.g. sliding, rotating, twisting) a magnet <b>2612</b> relative to a magnet <b>2614</b> in the cover to reverse the polarity of the magnets <b>2612</b>, <b>2614</b> from an attractive force to a repelling force. In one embodiment, the cover is spring loaded and can move from a closed position to an open position via the spring force. In this embodiment, when the magnetic coupling is deactivated by the user, the cover will automatically move from a closed position to an open position. In another embodiment this can be reversed, so that the spring force activates the cover from an open position to a closed position. In this embodiment, when the magnetic coupling is deactivated by the user, the cover will automatically close. In other embodiments, the cover can slide open or hinge open or twist open or rotate open, and the cover can have a spring force causing the cover to move from a closed position to an open position. In this embodiment, two or more magnets <b>2612</b>, <b>2614</b> can be used to secure the cover in the closed position (e.g., one or more magnets are located in the cover and one or more magnets are located in the lid or in the body of the travel mug <b>600</b>, <b>1700</b>A, <b>2000</b>, <b>2100</b>, <b>2400</b>, water bottle or liquid container). In this embodiment, one of the one or more magnets can be moved from a first position to a second position, decoupling the one or more magnets in the cover from the one or more magnets in the lid or the body. The movement of the one or more magnets from a first position to a second position can be accomplished using a user-actuated button <b>2620</b>, which can be on the cover or on the lid or on the body or can be actuated using a motor or an electromagnet. In the above embodiments, the âbodyâ can refer to the body of the travel mug, water bottle or liquid container or can refer to the body of a removable cap or removable lid of the travel mug, water bottle or liquid container. All of the embodiments described in the above paragraph require at least one or more magnets within the cover and one or more magnets within the lid or the body. Alternatively, the magnetic coupling can be achieved using a magnet in one portion of the assembly and a magnetically attractive metal in another portion of the assembly. Magnets attract to ferrous metals such as iron, nickel, cobalt, certain steels and other alloys. In one embodiment, one or more magnetics can be in the cover and one or more pieces of magnetically attractive material (e.g. iron, nickel, cobalt, certain steels and other alloys) can be in the lid or the body. In another embodiment, this can be reversed and the one or more magnets can be in the lid or the body and one or more pieces of magnetically attractive material (e.g. iron, nickel, cobalt, certain steels and other alloys) can be in the cover.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="2">Drinkware Container</heading>
      <p id="p-00424-en" num="0424">The various embodiments described below refer to a drinkware container. One of skill in the art will understand that the terms âdrinkware containerâ broadly refer to any portable handheld container that can hold a liquid for consumption, and includes containers such as cups, mugs, travel mugs, beer mugs, baby bottles, carafes and other handheld portable liquid containers.</p>
      <p id="p-00425-en" num="0425">
        <figref>FIG. 50</figref> shows a lengthwise cross-sectional view of an embodiment of a drinkware container <b>5000</b> (hereinafter âcontainer <b>5000</b>â). As only a cross-section is shown, the other half of the drinkware container <b>5000</b> is excluded in <figref>FIG. 50</figref> to illustrate the various components of the container <b>5000</b>. One of skill in the art will understand that the excluded portion of the drinkware container <b>5000</b> in <figref>FIG. 50</figref> is a mirror image of the portion of the drinkware container <b>5000</b> that is shown in <figref>FIG. 50</figref>. In the illustrated embodiment, the container <b>5000</b> is shown as a travel mug. However, as discussed above, the drinkware container <b>5000</b> can be other types of containers, such as a cup, mug, beer mug, baby bottle, carafe or other handheld portable liquid containers.</p>
      <p id="p-00426-en" num="0426">The container <b>5000</b> has an inner sidewall <b>5010</b> (e.g., a circumferential or cylindrical inner sidewall) and inner bottom wall <b>5012</b>, which together define a chamber <b>5015</b> that receives and holds a liquid therein. The container <b>5000</b> also has a second sidewall <b>5020</b> (e.g., a circumferential or cylindrical inner sidewall) that is spaced apart from the inner sidewall <b>5010</b> so as to define a chamber (e.g., an annular chamber) <b>5024</b> between the inner wall <b>5010</b> and the second wall <b>5020</b>. Optionally, the inner sidewall <b>5010</b> can be made of metal (e.g., stainless steel). However, in other embodiments, the inner sidewall <b>5010</b> can be made of other suitable materials. Optionally, the second sidewall <b>5020</b> can be made of the same material as the inner sidewall <b>5010</b> (e.g., both the inner sidewall <b>5010</b> and the second sidewall <b>5020</b> can be made of metal, such as stainless steel). In another embodiment, the second sidewall <b>5020</b> can be made of a different material than the inner sidewall <b>5010</b>; for example, the inner sidewall <b>5010</b> can be made of metal, such as stainless steel, and the second sidewall <b>5020</b> can be made of a plastic material that insulates the outer portion of the container <b>5000</b> from the inner sidewall <b>5010</b> and the liquid contents of the chamber <b>5015</b>. Optionally, the inner sidewall <b>5010</b> and the second sidewall <b>5020</b> are part of a single piece (e.g., monolithic piece), so that the inner and second sidewall <b>5010</b>, <b>5020</b> are fixed (e.g., not removable) relative to each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00427-en" num="0427">The chamber <b>5024</b> can be filled with a phase change material (PCM) <b>5025</b>. The PCM <b>5025</b> can be a solid-solid phase change material, or a solid-liquid phase change material. The PCM <b>5025</b> can be a wax (e.g., Paraffin wax). However, other suitable phase change materials (e.g., a metal) can be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00428-en" num="0428">The PCM <b>5025</b> can be selected to have a predetermined transition (e.g., melting) temperature that generally corresponds to a suitable drinking temperature for a heated liquid. In some embodiments, the predetermined transition temperature can optionally be between 135 degrees F. and 145 degrees F., such as optionally be 140 degrees F. In one embodiment, when the liquid (e.g., hot coffee, hot tea, soup) poured into the chamber <b>5015</b> of the container <b>5000</b> has a temperature above the predetermined transition temperature, the PCM <b>5025</b> can absorb heat from the liquid to cause the PCM <b>5025</b> to transition, for example, from a solid to a liquid, thereby decreasing the temperature of the liquid toward the said predetermined temperature. As the temperature of the liquid drops (e.g., via conduction of heat from the liquid through the inner sidewall <b>5010</b> to the PCM <b>5025</b>), the operation of the container <b>5000</b> approaches a steady state of operation where the temperature of the liquid approaches the predetermined transition temperature, where it can remain for an extended period of time (e.g., for at least 1 hour, for at least 2 hours, for at least 3 hours, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00429-en" num="0429">The container <b>5000</b> can have an outer sidewall <b>5030</b> (e.g., a circumferential or cylindrical inner sidewall) that extends from a rim <b>5031</b> of the container <b>5000</b> to an outer bottom wall <b>5032</b>. The rim <b>5031</b> can optionally partially define a drinking lip <b>5031</b><i>a </i>of the container <b>5000</b>, e.g., along with an opening Lo in a lid L that can removably cover the proximal end of the container <b>5000</b>. Optionally, the outer sidewall <b>5030</b> and outer bottom wall <b>5032</b> can be a single piece (e.g., monolithic with no seams). However, in other embodiments, at least a portion of the outer sidewall <b>5030</b> can be separate from the bottom wall <b>5032</b>, as discussed further below. The outer sidewall <b>5030</b> can be disposed radially outward from the second sidewall <b>5020</b>. Optionally, the outer sidewall <b>5030</b> can be radially spaced apart from the second sidewall <b>5020</b> to define a chamber <b>5034</b> (e.g., an annular chamber) therebetween. In one embodiment, the chamber <b>5034</b> can provide an air gap between the second sidewall <b>5020</b> and outer sidewall <b>5030</b>, where said air gap can insulate the outer sidewall <b>5030</b> from the second sidewall <b>5020</b> and the inner sidewall <b>5010</b>. In other embodiments, the chamber <b>5034</b> can be filled with an insulative material (e.g., foam). In still another embodiment, the chamber <b>5034</b> can optionally be under vacuum. However, in other embodiments, the outer sidewall <b>5030</b> can be adjacent the second sidewall <b>5020</b> so that there is no gap therebetween. Optionally, the outer sidewall <b>5030</b> can be made of an insulative material (e.g., foam, plastic).</p>
      <p id="p-00430-en" num="0430">With continued reference to <figref>FIG. 50</figref>, the container <b>5000</b> can optionally have one or more heating elements <b>5040</b> disposed about (e.g., circumferentially about) at least a portion of the inner wall <b>5010</b> so that it is in direct thermal communication with liquid in the chamber <b>5015</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the one or more heating elements <b>5040</b> are disposed about at least a portion of the inner wall <b>5010</b> at a location below the chamber <b>5024</b>. The one or more heating elements <b>5040</b> are optionally one or more resistive heaters. In one embodiment, the one or more heating elements <b>5040</b> can optionally be defined by a trace pattern screen printed onto the surface of the inner wall <b>5010</b>. A connecting lead line (not shown) can electrically connect the one or more heating elements <b>5040</b> to one or more power storage elements <b>5060</b> disposed in a bottom chamber <b>5050</b> and/or control circuitry <b>5080</b> disposed in the bottom chamber <b>5050</b>. For example, in one embodiment such a lead line can extend from the one or more heating elements <b>5040</b> downward along the inner bottom wall <b>5012</b> to the one or more power storage elements <b>5060</b> and/or control circuitry <b>5080</b>. In one embodiment, the one or more heating elements <b>5040</b> can optionally be a thermoelectric element. Though the discussion in this paragraph refers to one or more heating elements <b>5040</b>, one of skill in the art will recognize that this can also apply to one or more cooling elements or one or more heating and cooling elements (e.g., thermoelectric elements), and that this disclosure is meant to apply to all these options for the container <b>5000</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00431-en" num="0431">In the illustrated embodiment, the outer sidewall <b>5030</b> and outer bottom wall <b>5032</b> are optionally a single piece (e.g. monolithic with no seams), such that the one or more power storage elements <b>5060</b> (e.g., batteries, capacitors) and control circuitry <b>5080</b> are permanently housed in the chamber <b>5050</b>. In another embodiment, the outer bottom wall <b>5032</b> is removable relative to the outer sidewall <b>5030</b> to allow access to the chamber <b>5050</b> (e.g., to replace the power storage elements <b>5060</b>, perform maintenance on the electronics, etc.). In another embodiment, at least a portion of the outer sidewall <b>5030</b> can be separate from the outer bottom wall <b>5032</b> (and/or at least another portion of the outer sidewall <b>5030</b>) so that the one or more power storage elements <b>5060</b> and control circuitry <b>5080</b> are housed in a module that can be removably coupled to the rest of the container <b>5000</b>. For example, said module can be coupled to a bottom plate <b>5036</b> via a threaded connection, key-slot connection, magnetic connection, or other suitable connection. In such an embodiment, the lead line from the heating element <b>5040</b> can terminate at the bottom plate <b>5036</b> and establishes an electrical connection with a separate lead line in said module when the module is coupled to the container <b>5000</b>. In still another embodiment, the outer bottom wall <b>5032</b> can be removably attached to the container <b>5000</b> and can be removed to access the control circuitry <b>5080</b> and/or one or more power storage elements <b>5060</b> for maintenance, testing and/or replacement. In some embodiments, the bottom wall <b>5032</b> can have one or more electrical contacts on an outer surface thereof that contacts a corresponding electrical contact on a charging base (See e.g., charging base <b>7400</b> in <figref>FIG. 73</figref>, described below), through which the one or more power storage elements <b>5060</b> can be charged when the container <b>5000</b> is disposed on the charging base.

The container <b>5000</b> can optionally also include a movable sidewall <b>5031</b> disposed about the lower portion <b>5038</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the movable sidewall <b>5031</b> can rotate relative to the lower portion <b>5038</b> (e.g., about the axis of the container <b>5000</b>), e.g. via a bearing. In one embodiment, the movable sidewall <b>5031</b> can have substantially the same diameter as the outer sidewall <b>5030</b> at a location above the lower portion <b>5038</b>, so that the movable sidewall <b>5031</b> is substantially aligned with the outer sidewall <b>5030</b> at said location above the lower portion <b>5038</b>. In one embodiment, the movable sidewall <b>5031</b> can be in operative communication with one or more sensors that can sense the rotation of the movable sidewall <b>5031</b> with respect to at least a portion of the outer sidewall <b>5030</b> (e.g., with respect to at least a portion of the lower portion <b>5038</b>).

In one embodiment, the control circuitry <b>5080</b> can, via an algorithm stored in a memory of the control circuitry <b>5080</b>, associate an incremental rotation of the movable sidewall <b>5031</b> with an incremental change in a user selected temperature (as discussed above), and can operate the one or more heating elements <b>5040</b> so that the liquid in the chamber <b>5015</b> approaches said user selected temperature.

For example, the plurality of sensors <b>5016</b> can be mounted to a flex strip attached to (e.g., adhered to, such as with a thermally conductive adhesive) the inner sidewall <b>5010</b>. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref>FIG. 50A</figref>, the plurality of sensors <b>5016</b> are on the outer surface of the inner sidewall <b>5010</b> so as not to be within the chamber <b>5015</b>.

In one embodiment, the control circuitry <b>5080</b> can, based on the information sensed by the plurality of sensors <b>5016</b>, determine the differential in temperature between any two adjacent sensors. Where such differential exceeds a certain amount (e.g., 5 degrees F., 10 degrees F., 15 degrees F.) and/or indicates a temperature higher than ambient by a certain amount, the control circuitry <b>5080</b> can determine that the liquid level in the chamber <b>5015</b> is between said two sensors of the plurality of sensors <b>5016</b> that exhibit this temperature differential, and can indicate the location of liquid level (e.g., based on the arrangement of the plurality of sensors <b>5016</b> vertically along the inner sidewall <b>5010</b>), such as by communicating information associated with the determined liquid level (e.g., to a visual indication screen on the container <b>5000</b>, to a mobile electronic device associated with the container <b>5000</b>, etc.).

In the illustrated embodiment, the container <b>5100</b> is shown as a travel mug. However, as discussed above, the drinkware container <b>5100</b> can be other types of containers, such as a cup, mug, beer mug, baby bottle, carafe or other handheld portable liquid containers.</p>
      <p id="p-00445-en" num="0445">The container <b>5100</b> has an inner sidewall <b>5110</b> (e.g., a circumferential or cylindrical inner sidewall) and inner bottom wall <b>5112</b>, which together define a chamber <b>5115</b> that receives and holds a liquid therein. The container <b>5100</b> also has a second sidewall <b>5120</b> (e.g., a circumferential or cylindrical inner sidewall) and second bottom wall <b>5122</b> that are spaced apart from the inner sidewall <b>5110</b> and inner bottom wall <b>5112</b>, respectively, so as to define a chamber (e.g., an annular chamber) <b>5124</b> between the inner walls <b>5110</b>, <b>5112</b> and the second walls <b>5120</b>, <b>5122</b>. Optionally, the inner sidewall <b>5110</b> can be made of metal (e.g., stainless steel). However, in other embodiments, the inner sidewall <b>5110</b> can be made of other suitable materials. Optionally, the second sidewall <b>5120</b> can be made of the same material as the inner sidewall <b>5110</b> (e.g., both the inner sidewall <b>5110</b> and the second sidewall <b>5120</b> can be made of metal, such as stainless steel). In another embodiment, the second sidewall <b>5120</b> can be made of a different material than the inner sidewall <b>5110</b>; for example, the inner sidewall <b>5110</b> can be made of metal, such as stainless steel, and the second sidewall <b>5120</b> can be made of a plastic material that insulates the outer portion of the container <b>5100</b> from the inner sidewall <b>5110</b> and the liquid contents of the chamber <b>5115</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00446-en" num="0446">The chamber <b>5124</b> can be filled with a phase change material (PCM) <b>5125</b>. The PCM <b>5125</b> can be a solid-solid phase change material, or a solid-liquid phase change material. The PCM <b>5125</b> can be a wax (e.g., Paraffin wax). However, other suitable phase change materials (e.g., a metal) can be used).

In one embodiment, when the liquid (e.g., hot coffee, hot tea, soup) poured into the chamber <b>5115</b> of the container <b>5100</b> has a temperature above the predetermined transition temperature, the PCM <b>5125</b> can absorb heat from the liquid to cause the PCM <b>5125</b> to transition, for example, from a solid to a liquid, thereby decreasing the temperature of the liquid toward the said predetermined temperature. As the temperature of the liquid drops (e.g., via conduction of heat from the liquid through the inner sidewall <b>5110</b> to the PCM <b>5125</b>), the operation of the container <b>5100</b> approaches a steady state of operation where the temperature of the liquid approaches the predetermined transition temperature, where it can remain for an extended period of time (e.g., for at least 1 hour, for at least 2 hours, for at least 3 hours, etc.).</p>

      <p id="p-00501-en" num="0501">The one or more gates <b>6195</b> can be actuated mechanically or electrically.

The heating element <b>6240</b> is optionally a resistive heater. In other embodiments, the heating element <b>6240</b> can optionally be a thermoelectric element (e.g., Peltier element).

For example, by sensing how long it takes for the liquid to change temperature upon actuation of the heating element <b>6240</b>, the algorithm can calculate the approximate volume of liquid in the chamber <b>6215</b> (e.g., if the container <b>6200</b> is full of liquid, it may take X seconds for the sensed temperature to change, but if the container <b>6200</b> is half-full of liquid, it may take Y seconds for the sensed temperature to change).

      <p id="p-00567-en" num="0567">With continued reference to <figref>FIG. 73</figref>, a module <b>7390</b> (e.g., a heating module) can optionally include one or more of heating elements <b>7340</b> (similar to heating element <b>6940</b> in <figref>FIG. 69A</figref>), one or more power storage element (not shown, but similar to power storage element <b>6260</b> in <figref>FIG. 62</figref>) and/or control circuitry (not shown, but similar to control circuitry <b>6280</b> in <figref>FIG. 62</figref>). In embodiments where the element <b>7340</b> is a thermoelectric module, the element can function in heating or cooling mode to heat or cool the liquid in the container <b>7300</b>. The module <b>7390</b> can removably couple to the bottom portion of the container <b>7300</b> so that the one or more heating elements <b>7340</b> is in contact with the bottom surface <b>7336</b>. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the electronics are only housed in the module <b>7390</b>, not in the vessel defined by the outer sidewall <b>7330</b> and bottom surface or wall <b>7336</b>. In another embodiment, the one or more heating elements can be incorporated into the container <b>7300</b> (as disclosed in other embodiments herein), and power to the one or more heating elements can be communicated from the module <b>7390</b> via one or more electrical contacts between the container <b>7300</b> and the module <b>7390</b> (such as disclosed above in connection with container <b>7100</b>). Though the discussion in this paragraph refers to one or more heating elements <b>7340</b>, one of skill in the art will recognize that this can also apply to one or more cooling elements or one or more heating or cooling elements (e.g., thermoelectric elements), and that this disclosure is meant to apply to all these options for the container <b>7300</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00568-en" num="0568">The module <b>7390</b> can have one or more magnets <b>7392</b> (see <figref>FIGS. 74A-74B</figref>) configured to magnetically couple to the bottom surface <b>7336</b> where the surface <b>7336</b> is made of metal. In other embodiments, where the bottom surface <b>7336</b> is not made of metal (e.g., it's made of polycarbonate material), the bottom surface <b>7336</b> can have one or more magnets on an outer surface thereof or embedded therein, to which the one or more magnets <b>7392</b> can couple when the module <b>7390</b> couples to the bottom of the container <b>7300</b>. Once the user is done using the module <b>7390</b> (e.g., to heat a liquid in the container <b>7300</b>), the user can decouple the module <b>7390</b> from the container <b>7300</b> (e.g., to allow the container <b>7300</b> to be washed).</p>
      <p id="p-00569-en" num="0569">Advantageously, the magnetic coupling allows a user to couple the container <b>7300</b> to the module <b>7390</b> with one hand (e.g., while holding a baby or infant with their other arm), thereby greatly facilitating the heating of the contents of the container <b>7300</b>. For example, a user can keep one or more containers <b>7300</b> filled with a liquid (e.g., milk) in a refrigerator, travel cooler, etc. Once the baby or infant awakens at night or is otherwise ready for a feeding, the user can take one of the containers <b>7300</b> out of the refrigerator with one hand (e.g., while holding the baby or infant in their other arm), place it over the module <b>7390</b> (which can be docked over a charging base <b>7400</b> at the time), whereby the magnets <b>7392</b> automatically couple the module <b>7390</b> to the container <b>7300</b>. The user can then lift the container <b>7300</b> with the attached module <b>7390</b> and give it to the baby or infant once ready (e.g., walk back to place the baby or infant in bed and provide them with the container <b>7300</b> with the heated liquid). In one embodiment, the module <b>7390</b> can provide an indication (e.g., visual, vibration, auditory) that the liquid has been heated to the preselected or predetermined temperature (as discussed further below). For example, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 75A-75B</figref>, the module <b>7390</b> can have a visual indication screen <b>7395</b> that can indicate to the user the status of the heating process. <figref>FIG. 75A</figref> shows a âHEATINGâ notice, which identifies the user that the liquid in the container <b>7300</b> is not yet at the desired drinking temperature. However, other suitable notices, such as NOT READY, etc. can be used, or the screen can blink. <figref>FIG. 75B</figref> shows a âREADYâ notice, which identifies to the user that the liquid in the container <b>7300</b> has been heated to the desired temperature (or temperature range) and is ready for consumption. However, other suitable notices, such as SAFE or OKAY, etc. can be used, or the screen can remain lit (not blink). The visual indication screen <b>7395</b> can be automatically activated when the module <b>7390</b> couples to the container <b>7300</b>. In one embodiment, the visual indication screen <b>7395</b> can be a hidden till-lit white LED dot matrix display. The visual indication screen <b>7395</b> can also provide other information, such as operating information (e.g., battery life, liquid level, heating or cooling operation).</p>
      <p id="p-00570-en" num="0570">In one embodiment, the user can decouple the module <b>7390</b> from the container <b>7300</b> before handing the container <b>7300</b> to the baby or infant for consumption. In another embodiment, the module <b>7390</b> can remain attached to the container <b>7300</b> while the baby or infant consumes the liquid in the container <b>7300</b>. As noted above, the container <b>7300</b> can advantageously be coupled to the module <b>7390</b> with one hand by the user (e.g., while their other hand is occupied, such as holding the infant) by placing the container <b>7300</b> over the module <b>7390</b>. In one embodiment, the module <b>7390</b> couples to the container <b>7300</b> solely via the magnets <b>7392</b> as discussed above; the magnetic coupling force can be large enough to inhibit the decoupling of the module <b>7390</b> from the container <b>7300</b> by the baby or infant (e.g., while consuming the liquid in the container <b>7300</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00571-en" num="0571">In another embodiment, the module <b>7390</b> couples to the container <b>7300</b> via a combination of mechanisms disclosed herein. For example, the module <b>7390</b> can couple to the container <b>7300</b> via magnets <b>7392</b>, as discussed above, and in addition the bottom of the container <b>7300</b> and top of the module <b>7390</b> can have a pin-notch system (similar to the one described above for container <b>7200</b> in <figref>FIG. 72</figref>) or a ramp and notch mechanism that provides a twist-lock arrangement to the coupling to thereby provide a connection between the container <b>7300</b> and module <b>7390</b> that is more difficult to remove (e.g., more difficult for the baby or infant to decouple, such as while consuming the liquid in the container <b>7300</b>). For example, where the container <b>7300</b> and module <b>7390</b> have a ramp and notch system in addition to magnets <b>7392</b>, when the user places the container <b>7300</b> over the module <b>7390</b> (which may be sitting on the charging base <b>7400</b>), the magnets <b>7392</b> on the module <b>7390</b> start to draw the module <b>7390</b> toward the bottom surface <b>7336</b> of the container <b>7300</b>. As the module <b>7390</b> is drawn toward the bottom surface <b>7336</b>, the ramps (on the module <b>7390</b> or the container <b>7300</b>) can engage the notches or recesses (on the container <b>7300</b> or the module <b>7390</b>) to provide for a locking connection between the module <b>7390</b> and the container <b>7300</b>. In one embodiment, the engagement of the ramps and notches or recesses can cause the module <b>7390</b> to rotate relative to the container <b>7300</b> as the locking connection is achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00572-en" num="0572">In one embodiment, the container <b>7300</b> that is used with the removable module <b>7390</b> can be a conventional plastic or glass baby bottle. In another embodiment, the container <b>7300</b> can be a conventional sippy cup made of plastic. In such embodiments, the container <b>7300</b> includes no electronics therein; all the electronics and heating elements are housed in the removable module <b>7390</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00573-en" num="0573">Advantageously, because the module <b>7300</b> is removable, it can be used with a plurality of separate containers <b>7300</b>. Thus, a user can use one module <b>7390</b> to heat a plurality of separate containers <b>7300</b> and need not purchase a plurality of containers that each includes its separate electronics and heating unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00574-en" num="0574">In one embodiment, actuation of the one or more heating elements <b>7340</b> can begin automatically upon the coupling of the module <b>7390</b> to the container <b>7300</b>. For example, one or more sensors can sense when the module <b>7390</b> couples to the container <b>7300</b> and communicate a signal to control circuitry <b>7380</b> (see <figref>FIGS. 74A-74B</figref>) in the module <b>7390</b> to provide power to the one or more heating elements <b>7340</b> to generate heat. Said heat can be communicated from the one or more heating elements <b>7340</b> to the bottom surface <b>7336</b> of the container <b>7300</b> via conduction heat transfer, and the heat transferred through the bottom surface <b>7336</b> to the contents of the container <b>7300</b>. Conversely, actuation of the one or more heating elements <b>7340</b> can cease automatically upon decoupling of the module <b>7390</b> from the container <b>7300</b> (e.g., based on sensed information from one or more sensors that the module <b>7390</b> is not coupled to the container <b>7300</b>. Such one or more sensors can include a pressure sensor, a contact sensor, a capacitance sensor, an optical sensor, or any other suitable type of sensor for sensing the coupling or decoupling of the module <b>7390</b> with the container <b>7300</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00575-en" num="0575">The control circuitry <b>7380</b> (see <figref>FIGS. 74A-74B</figref>) can control the operation of the one or more heating elements <b>7340</b> to control the amount of energy supplied to the liquid in the chamber of the container <b>7300</b> to maintain or increase the temperature of the liquid. Optionally, the control circuitry <b>7380</b> can control delivery of power to the one or more heating elements <b>7340</b> based at least in part on information from one or more sensors that sense a parameter of quality of the liquid (e.g., temperature, volume, acidity, pH) where said one or more sensors can be on a surface of one or both of the module <b>7390</b> and container <b>7300</b>. For example, such sensors can be on the bottom surface <b>7336</b> and/or the top surface of the module <b>7390</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00576-en" num="0576">The control circuitry <b>7380</b> can include a memory that stores or receives one or more algorithms (e.g., wirelessly via a tablet or smartphone app, via a wired connection or during manufacturing of the module <b>7390</b> at the factory) that can be executed by the control circuitry <b>7380</b> to control the operation of the one or more heating elements <b>7340</b> and/or to determine a parameter of the liquid based on sensed information. In one embodiment, such algorithms can be used to determine one or more parameters of the liquid in the container <b>7300</b> based on sensed information for another parameter of the liquid. In one embodiment, the container <b>7300</b> can include one or more sensors in communication with inner liquid holding chamber <b>7315</b> (e.g., in contact with the sidewall <b>7330</b> or bottom wall <b>7336</b>, whose sensed information can provide an indication of a temperature of the liquid in the container <b>7300</b>, and an algorithm can calculate a volume of the liquid in the chamber based on the sensed information of the same sensor. For example, by sensing how long it takes for the liquid to change temperature upon actuation of the one or more heating elements <b>7340</b>, the algorithm can calculate the approximate volume of liquid in the chamber (e.g., if the container <b>7300</b> is full of liquid, it may take X seconds for the sensed temperature to change, but if the container <b>7300</b> is half-full of liquid, it may take Y seconds for the sensed temperature to change). Though such algorithms are described in connection with the container <b>7300</b>, one of skill in the art will recognize that such algorithms can be implemented or use by the control circuitry of the containers <b>5000</b>-<b>7200</b>, <b>7400</b>-<b>7700</b>, and other containers disclosed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00577-en" num="0577">The sensed temperature can be communicated to the control circuitry <b>7380</b>, which can then adjust the amount of power supplied to the one or more heating elements <b>7340</b> based on the sensed temperature (e.g., the control circuitry can reduce power to the one or more heating elements <b>7340</b> as the desired temperature for the liquid is approached). Additionally, the control circuitry <b>7380</b> can control the operation of the one or more heating elements <b>7340</b> based on preselected temperature (e.g., user selected temperature, such as one provided by the user directly via a user interface (e.g., similar to movable sidewall <b>5031</b> in <figref>FIG. 50</figref>) on the module <b>7390</b>, or wirelessly via a tablet or smartphone app), or based on a predetermined temperature set point (e.g., temperature set point saved into a memory of the control circuitry <b>7380</b>, either by a user, such as via a tablet or smartphone app, or at the factory during manufacture). The control circuitry <b>7380</b> can advantageously control the amount of power supplied to the one or more heating elements <b>7340</b> to prevent the temperature of the liquid from increasing above the predetermined or preselected temperature. For example, in one embodiment, the control circuitry <b>7380</b> can include a temperature sensitive switch, which can open if the sensed temperature of the liquid in the container <b>7300</b> increases above a temperature set point, thereby cutting off power supply to the one or more heating elements <b>7340</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00578-en" num="0578">With continued reference to <figref>FIG. 73</figref>, a charging assembly <b>7400</b> can be provided for charging the module <b>7390</b>. The charging assembly <b>7400</b> can have a charging plate <b>7410</b> with one or more recesses <b>7420</b> into which a bottom portion of the module <b>7390</b> can be placed so that a corresponding electrical contact on a charging base <b>7396</b> of the module <b>7390</b> contacts an electrical contact <b>7430</b> of the charging plate <b>7410</b>. In one embodiment, the electrical contact <b>7430</b> can be circular, though other shapes are possible. In one embodiment, the electrical contact <b>7430</b> is gold plated. The illustrated embodiment shows the charging plate <b>7410</b> with two recesses <b>7420</b> and two electrical contacts <b>7430</b> to charge two separate modules <b>7390</b> at the same time. However, in other embodiments, the charging plate <b>7410</b> can have a single recess <b>7420</b> and single electrical contact <b>7430</b>. The charging plate <b>7410</b> can connect via an electrical cord <b>7440</b> to an electrical connector <b>7450</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the electrical connector <b>7450</b> is a wall connector for connecting to AC power. In other embodiments, the electrical connector <b>7450</b> can be a connector for connecting to DC power, such as to a car charger. In still another embodiment, the electrical connector <b>7450</b> can be a USB connector that allows the electrical cord to be connected to a computer, portable battery, or to a separate wall connector for connecting to a wall outlet.</p>

      <p id="p-00591-en" num="0591">In the illustrated embodiment, the container <b>7700</b> has an outer wall <b>7730</b> and bottom wall <b>7736</b> made of plastic, glass or other conventional material used for, e.g., baby bottles, and define a chamber <b>7715</b> therebetween for holding a liquid (e.g., milk). A cap <b>7720</b> can couple to the top of the container <b>7700</b>, and a connector <b>7797</b> can be held in place on top of the container <b>7700</b> by the cap <b>7720</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the connector <b>7797</b> can be a nipple (e.g., made of rubber, silicone, or other common material used in baby bottle nipples). In another embodiment, the connector <b>7797</b> can be similar to a drinking spout in a sippy cup.</p>
      <p id="p-00592-en" num="0592">A module <b>7790</b> can be inserted into the container <b>7700</b> and held in place by the cap <b>7720</b>. The module <b>7790</b> can have a sensor strip <b>7793</b> that extends along at least a portion of the module <b>7790</b>, and at least one heating element <b>7740</b> that can be disposed within the chamber <b>7715</b> and can heat the liquid in the chamber <b>7715</b>. The at least one heating element <b>7740</b> can be activated as soon as it's inserted into the chamber <b>7715</b> (e.g., by sensing contact with a liquid. Alternatively, the heating element <b>7740</b> can be activated based on user input (e.g., via an interface of the module <b>7790</b> or wirelessly). Though the discussion in this paragraph refers to one or more heating elements <b>7740</b>, one of skill in the art will recognize that this can also apply to one or more cooling elements or one or more heating or cooling elements (e.g., thermoelectric elements), and that this disclosure is meant to apply to all these options for the container <b>7700</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00593-en" num="0593">The module <b>7790</b> can further have one or more power storage elements <b>7760</b> and a control circuitry <b>7780</b>. A rim of the module <b>7790</b> can rest on the rim (not shown) of the container <b>7700</b> when in use. The rim can include charging contacts <b>7798</b> that can contact corresponding electrical contacts on a charging assembly (not shown) when the power storage elements <b>7760</b> are charged. One or more passages between the rim of the module <b>7790</b> and the heating element <b>7740</b> allow for flow of liquid to pass along flow path F and into the connector <b>7797</b> for consumption. Therefore, the module <b>7790</b> can be left in place in the container <b>7700</b> while the infant or baby consumes the contents of the container <b>7700</b>. Alternatively, the module <b>7790</b> can be removed from within the chamber <b>7715</b> and the cap <b>7720</b> and connector <b>7797</b> reattached to the container <b>7700</b> before the liquid is consumed by the infant or baby.</p>
      <p id="p-00594-en" num="0594">Though the features disclosed above may be described in connection with the container <b>7700</b>, one of skill in the art will recognize that any of the features described in this embodiment can also apply to any of the portable liquid containers disclosed herein (e.g., <b>5000</b>-<b>7600</b>), drinkware, dishware or serverware (e.g., bowl, serving dish, hot plate, cup and/or liquid container), including the plate <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>â², <b>800</b>, <b>800</b>â², <b>900</b>, <b>1100</b>, <b>1300</b>, <b>1400</b>, carafe, bread basket <b>2200</b>, tortilla warmer <b>2300</b>, etc. and the scope of disclosure and the invention is understood to cover such liquid containers, drinkware, dishware and serverware.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 44</figref> above shows a block diagram of a communication system for any of the drinkware containers described herein. In the illustrated embodiment, the electronic module EM (such as the electronic module disclosed herein for the drinkware containers) can receive sensed information from one or more sensors S<b>1</b>-Sn (e.g., liquid level sensors, liquid volume sensors, temperature sensors, battery charge sensors, capacitance sensors, tilt sensors or gyroscopes). The electronic module EM can also receive information from and transmit information (e.g., instructions) to one or more heating elements HC (e.g., to operate each of the heating elements in a heating mode, turn off, turn on, vary power output of, etc.) and optionally to one or more power storage devices PS (e.g., batteries, such as to charge the batteries or manage the power provided by the batteries to the one or more heating or cooling elements). The electronic module EM can also communicate with a wireless power transmitter WPT (e.g., an inductive power transmitter) on the drinkware container. The electronic module EM can also communicate with (e.g., transmit information to and receive information, such as user instructions from, a user interface UI<b>1</b> on the unit (e.g., on the body of the drinkware container). The electronic module EM can also communicate with an electronic device ED (e.g., a mobile electronic device such as a mobile phone, PDA, tablet computer, laptop computer, electronic watch; or a desktop computer) via the cloud CL or via a wireless communication system such as Bluetooth BT. The electronic device ED can have a user interface UI<b>2</b>, that can display information associated with the operation of the drinkware container (as disclosed herein), and that can receive information (e.g., instructions) from a user and communicate said information to the drinkware container (as disclosed herein).</p>
      <p id="p-00596-en" num="0596">The term âelectronic moduleâ is meant to refer to electronics generally. Furthermore, the term âelectronic moduleâ should not be interpreted to require that the electronics be all in one physical location or connected to one single printed circuit board (PCB). One of skill in the art will recognize that the electronic module or electronics disclosed herein can be in one or more (e.g., plurality) of separate parts (coupled to one or a plurality of PCBs) and/or located in different physical locations of the body of the drinkware container, as disclosed herein. That is, the electronic module or electronics can have different form factors.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">Sensors</heading>
      <p id="p-00597-en" num="0597">With respect to any of the containers disclosed above, one or more sensors S<b>1</b>-Sn can be provided. In some embodiments, at least one sensor S<b>2</b> of the one or more sensors S<b>1</b>-Sn can sense a liquid level (or information indicative of a liquid level) in a chamber (e.g., such as chamber <b>15</b> in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, etc.) of the container.</p>
      <p id="p-00598-en" num="0598">In one embodiment, the sensor S<b>2</b> can be a load cell that can sense a weight of the container (e.g., container <b>5000</b>-<b>7700</b>). The electronic module EM of the container can receive the sensed weight information and compare it against a reference weight data (e.g., previously sensed when the container was empty and/or that is stored in a memory of the electronic module EM), and calculate a volume or level of the liquid in the container (e.g., using an algorithm to convert the sensed weight information to liquid volume or level measurement).</p>
      <p id="p-00599-en" num="0599">In another embodiment, the sensor S<b>2</b> can be a pressure sensor on a bottom of the chamber (e.g., chamber <b>5015</b>, <b>5115</b>, etc.) of the container (e.g., container <b>5000</b>-<b>7700</b>) and can sense a hydrostatic pressure of the liquid in the chamber. The electronic module EM can calculate a liquid volume or level based at least in part on the sensed pressure information from the sensor S<b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00600-en" num="0600">In another embodiment, the sensor S<b>2</b> can be a capacitance sensor (e.g., capacitance sensing strip) that extends along at least a portion of the length of an inner sidewall (e.g., inner sidewall <b>5010</b>, <b>5110</b>, etc.) that defines the chamber (e.g., chamber <b>5015</b>, <b>5115</b>, etc.) of the container (e.g., container <b>5000</b>-<b>7700</b>). The sensor S<b>2</b> can sense a capacitance of a liquid in the container relative to a capacitance of air above the liquid level and communicate the sensed information to the electronic module EM, which can provide a measurement of liquid volume or liquid level in the container based on the sensed information. In another embodiment, the sensor S<b>2</b> can sense a conductivity of the liquid or air proximate the sensor and the electronic module EM can provide a measurement of liquid level or volume based at least in part on the sensed information.</p>
      <p id="p-00601-en" num="0601">In another embodiment, the sensor S<b>2</b> can be an ultrasonic sensor on an inner sidewall (e.g., inner sidewall <b>5010</b>, <b>5110</b>, etc.) that defines the chamber (e.g., chamber <b>5015</b>, <b>5115</b>, etc.) of the container (e.g., container <b>5000</b>-<b>7700</b>). The sensor S<b>2</b> can use a pulse-echo or wall resonance (e.g. resonance of inner sidewall <b>5010</b>, <b>5110</b>, etc.) to sense information indicative of a liquid level in the container. For example, the sensor S<b>2</b> can sense a time it takes for pulse emitted by the sensor S<b>2</b> into the chamber of the container to return to the sensor (e.g., once it bounces from the liquid level location). The sensor S<b>2</b> can transmit the sensed information to the electronic module EM, which can provide a measurement of liquid volume or liquid level in the container based on the sensed information.</p>
      <p id="p-00602-en" num="0602">In another embodiment, the sensor S<b>2</b> can be an accelerometer or tilt sensor. The sensor S<b>2</b> can sense an orientation (or change in orientation) of the container (e.g., container <b>5000</b>-<b>7700</b>) and communicate the sensed orientation information to the electronic module EM. The electronic module EM can estimate a liquid level in the container based on the sensed orientation information (e.g., using an algorithm that correlates a tilt angle to a liquid level). For example, if the sensor S<b>2</b> senses an orientation of less than a first threshold (e.g., less than 30 degrees from an upright position) when a user has the container against their lips (e.g., sensed via a sensor on the container lip or lid, such as a contact sensor, temperature sensor, etc.) then the electronic module estimates the liquid level to be about full, and if the sensor S<b>2</b> senses an orientation greater than a second threshold (e.g., greater than 90 degrees from an upright position) when a user has the container against their lips (e.g., sensed via a sensor on the container lip or lid, such as a contact sensor, temperature sensor, etc.) then the electronic module estimates the liquid level to be about empty, and the electronic module EM can use an algorithm to interpolate between the two thresholds to infer intermediate liquid levels of the container (e.g., half full, quarter full, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00603-en" num="0603">In another embodiment, the sensor S<b>2</b> can be a light sensor that measures light attenuation through the liquid and provides the sensed information to the electronic module EM, which can provide a measurement of liquid volume or liquid level in the container based on the sensed information (e.g., using an algorithm to correlate light attenuation with liquid volume or level).</p>
      <p id="p-00604-en" num="0604">In another embodiment, the sensor S<b>2</b> can be a float that floats on the liquid level in the chamber (e.g., chamber <b>5015</b>, <b>5115</b>, etc.) of the container (e.g., container <b>5000</b>-<b>7700</b>) and communicates the sensed position information to the electronic module EM, which can provide a measurement of liquid volume or liquid level in the container based on the sensed information.</p>
      <p id="p-00605-en" num="0605">In another embodiment, liquid level in the container (e.g., container <b>5000</b>-<b>7700</b>) is measured based on sensed temperature (or information indicative of temperature) from one or more (e.g., a plurality of) temperature sensors S<b>3</b> (e.g., as discussed above in connection with the operation of the container <b>5000</b>). In one embodiment, the one or more sensors S<b>3</b> can sense how long it takes the temperature to increase a reference number of degrees (e.g., 1 degree F. or 1 degree C.) when the chamber of the container is full of liquid to provide a first reference time, and the first reference time can be stored in a memory (e.g., a memory of the electronic module EM). Optionally, additional reference times can be provided by the one or more sensors S<b>3</b> when the chamber of the container has other volumes of liquid therein (e.g., half full, Â¾full) and the reference times stored in said memory. During operation of the container, the one or more temperature sensors S<b>3</b> can measure how long it takes for the temperature in the chamber to change by said reference number of degrees and communicate the sensed time information to the electronic module EM, which can provide a measurement of liquid volume or liquid level in the container based on the sensed time information, for example, based on an algorithm correlating time versus liquid volume or level. In one embodiment, the sensed time information is compared against one or more of the reference times and the liquid level or volume interpolated between the level or volume values corresponding to the reference times. Optionally, the algorithm can calculate the liquid volume or level based at least in part on sensed ambient temperature (e.g., from a sensor S<b>4</b>), to account for variations in how long it takes the temperature to increases by the reference number of degrees depending on ambient temperature (e.g., at high altitude, low altitude, in winter, in summer, etc.). Use of the one or more temperature sensor S<b>3</b> therefore advantageously allows measurement of temperature and liquid level in the container with one sensor instead of requiring a separate sensor to measure liquid level, which provides for a simpler and less costly system.</p>
