      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a tissue retractor configured for delivery through a narrow tissue port and to methods of delivering same through the port.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is a surgical technique in which a body cavity (e.g. abdominal cavity) is accessed via several small incisions as opposed to the large incision access used in open surgery.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Surgical tools are inserted into the body cavity through ports positioned within the small incisions with the actuating handles of the surgical tools positioned outside the body. The surgeon manipulates the surgical tool via the handle while viewing the operative field on a video feed provided by a camera and a light source mounted on a rod inserted through one of the ports.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">During minimally invasive surgery, the surgeon is required to expose and handle delicate tissues deep within the body cavities. This requires creation and maintenance of a surgical workspace large enough to enable the surgeon to view and work within the treatment area without damaging surrounding tissues.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">To provide the surgeon with a good view of the operative field, the body cavity is usually insufflated with carbon dioxide gas and organs that obstruct the field of view of the camera and block access to the treatment area are retracted using a tissue retractor.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Tissue retractors are generally inserted into the body cavity in a collapsed conformation through an additional port, and are then expanded within the body and either held by an assistant or fixed to an object such as the operating table.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Tissue retractors known in the art typically utilize mechanically deployable arms/fingers (the Endo Retractâ¢ by BioMedicon), baskets (A-Lap by EZSurgical) or hooks (Virtual Ports) which can be used to sweep and/or move tissue organs out of the treatment area. Inflatable retractors are also known in the art (e.g. Extrahandâ¢ Balloon Retractor by BioMedicon), however due to their simple paddle-like configuration such retractors are more suitable for containing tissue than retracting it.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Trocar ports typically used for positioning of surgical tools and tissue retractors within a body cavity range from 5 mm to 12 mm in diameter. In recent years efforts to further minimize the impact of minimally invasive surgery on wall tissue have lead to an increase in use of 5 mm trocar ports. Although such ports substantially minimize surgical trauma to abdominal wall tissue and improve tissue access site closure following surgery, they limit the size of a laparoscopic tool head that can be delivered therethrough into the abdominal cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Several laparoscopic tool configurations have been developed in order to traverse such limitations of 5 mm trocar ports. For example, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20100298774 describes an approach in which the laparoscopic tool shaft is delivered into a body cavity through a narrow working port (e.g. 5 mm) and back out of the body cavity through a wide access port (e.g. 10 mm) The working head is then attached to the distal end of the shaft (positioned outside the body) and is pulled back into the cavity through the wide access port. Although such an approach enables use of a narrow port for surgical access during surgery, it requires a second wide access port for attaching the working head to the shaft and requires a camera port for enabling such attachment.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">While reducing the present invention to practice, the present inventors have devised novel approaches for delivering a tissue retractor having an inflatable working head into a body cavity through a narrow (e.g. 5 mm) trocar port.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">According to an aspect of some embodiments of the invention, there is provided a tissue retractor device comprising: an inflatable tissue retractor head attached to a distal end of a shaft, the inflatable retractor head comprising one or more finger-like extensions shaped and sized to move tissue within a body cavity, and a tensile element coupled to the inflatable tissue retractor head, the tensile element slidably received within one or more recesses configured in the head.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">According to some embodiments of the invention, the tensile element is configured to resist bending of the head relative to the shaft from a set position.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">According to some embodiments of the invention, the set position comprises an angulated position of the head relative to the shaft.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">According to some embodiments of the invention, an angle between the head and the shaft is between 20-180 degrees.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">According to some embodiments of the invention, the tensile element controls angulation of the head relative to the shaft.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">According to some embodiments of the invention, the one or more recesses of the head are located at one or more webbing portions connecting between the finger-like extensions, and the tensile element is threadedly received within the one or more recesses.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">According to some embodiments of the invention, the tensile element extends between the head and the shaft.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">According to some embodiments of the invention, the tensile element is attached to the shaft by a hook like element, the hook like element axially moveable within the shaft.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">According to some embodiments of the invention, each end of the tensile element is attached to a separate hook like element, the elements axially movable with respect to the shaft and with respect to each other to articulate the head.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">According to some embodiments of the invention, the tensile element is configured to slide with respect to an outer surface of the head to a limited extent that reduces a risk of tear to the head when inflated, while still providing for control of angulation using the tensile element.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">According to some embodiments of the invention, pulling on the tensile element reduces the angle between the head and the shaft, and loosening the tensile element allows the angle to increase.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">According to some embodiments of the invention, the tensile element is strong enough to resist a natural urge of the head, when inflated, to extend linearly with respect to the shaft.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">According to some embodiments of the invention, the set position comprises a linear position of the head with respect the shaft, in which the head is positioned substantially at a 180 degree angle relative to the shaft.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">According to some embodiments of the invention, the tensile element is in the form of a strap, string, cable or band.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">According to some embodiments of the invention, the tensile element is wrapped around at least one finger-like extension, forming a lasso-like configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">According to some embodiments of the invention, the head comprises two recesses through which the tensile element extends, the recesses symmetrically arranged with respect to the head.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">According to some embodiments of the invention, the tensile element is external to the inflatable retractor head.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">According to some embodiments of the invention, the device further comprises a sheath shaped and sized to cover the inflatable head in a deflated state, the sheath shaped and sized to slidably fit within a lumen of a trocar.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">According to an aspect of some embodiments of the invention, there is provided a tissue retractor device comprising: an inflatable tissue retractor head attached to a distal end of a shaft, the inflatable retractor head comprising one or more finger-like extensions shaped and sized to move tissue within a body cavity, and a tensile element coupled to the inflatable tissue retractor head, the tensile element resisting bending of the inflatable tissue retractor head relative to the shaft to maintain the head at a substantially linear configuration relative to the shaft.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The present invention is of a tissue retractor which can be delivered through a narrow access port (e.g. 5 mm trocar) and used in a laparoscopic surgical procedure to grasp, move and contain tissue organs.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The principles and operation of the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and accompanying descriptions.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">In a previously filed patent application, the present inventors described a tissue retractor that can be effectively used for grasping and moving tissue as well as containing it while minimizing trauma to the organ and surrounding tissue. The tissue retractor incorporates an inflatable tissue retraction head (e.g. non-compliant balloon) which is configured for selectively engaging, grasping and containing tissue organs. Such selective modes of operation are controlled by the degree of deployment of the tissue retractor head which is in turn controlled by inflation and/or by mechanical elements.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">While delivery of this tissue retractor through a wide trocar port (e.g. 10-12 mm) can be effected with ease, delivery through narrow trocar ports (e.g. 5 mm) can be challenging due to the diameter of the deflated and folded tissue retractor head.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">In order to overcome such limitations, the present inventors devised a tissue retractor configuration that can be easily delivered through narrow ports and yet retains the tissue retraction area of the previously described inflatable retractor head and its functionality.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">Two novel features of the present tissue retractor facilitate delivery of a tissue retractor having an inflatable retractor head through a narrow access port, a detachable handle with a sealable fluid conduit and a sheath for covering the inflatable retractor head when deflated.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">Thus, according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a tissue retractor (also referred to herein as the present device) for use in surgery, preferably minimally invasive surgery.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">As used herein, the phrase âminimally invasive surgeryâ (also âendoscopic surgeryâ) refers to a surgical procedure in which the surgical workspace is not directly viewed or accessed by a surgeon. Laparoscopic surgery includes operations within the abdominal or pelvic cavities, whereas thoracoscopic surgery includes operations within the thoracic or chest cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">As used herein, the phrases âaccess siteâ or âtissue access siteâ refer to the incision in a tissue wall to provide access to a body cavity, while the phrases âaccess portâ or âtissue access portâ refer to a trocar, cannula or any other device which is positioned through a tissue access site to provide access to a body cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The present device includes a shaft which is attached to an inflatable tissue retractor head positioned at a distal end thereof. The proximal end of the shaft is attachable to a handle via a releasable mechanism (e.g. quick snap) and as such, the handle is detachable from the shaft of the present tissue retractor.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The shaft can have any diameter and length suitable for minimally invasive surgery. Depending on the type of surgery, the configuration of the tissue retractor head and the size of access port used (inner diameter of cannula or trocar port), the shaft can be anywhere from 10 cm in length and 5 mm or less in diameter.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">While reducing the present invention to practice, the present inventors fabricated a 5 mm alloy shaft which includes fluid conduits (for inflation of tissue retractor head) and yet maintains at least 80% of the axial rigidity of a normal 10 mm alloy shaft. Since laparoscopic tissue retraction requires a tool shaft that can efficiently transfer operator movements (at the handle) to the tissue retractor head, a shaft design having minimal deflection under side load is an advantage.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">The distal end of the shaft is mechanically connected to the tissue retractor head via an immovable or hinged connection. Since the tissue retractor head is at least partially deployable via inflation, fluid conduits running through the shaft connect the tissue retractor head to a fluid source which can be situated within the handle or external to the device (in which case fluid ports are provided in the proximal end of the handle).</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">In order to enable fluid communication between a fluid source and the inflatable retractor head, the fluid conduit positioned within the shaft is connectable to a fluid conduit positionable within the handle via, for example, male-female plugs which include a seal (e.g. O-ring) or any similar mechanism. When the shaft is mounted on, and connected to, the handle, these plugs mate and form a fluid tight seal between the handle and shaft-positioned conduits.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">The handle provides an interface with the surgeon and includes controls over deployment (e.g. inflation) and positioning of the tissue retractor head.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">The inflatable tissue retractor head positioned at the distal end of the shaft is configured such that when inflated with a fluid (e.g. Air, CO<sub>2 </sub>or Nitrogen gas, water, saline), it includes at least one extension which is sized and configured for enabling the tissue retractor head to hook over a tissue of, for example, an organ such as an intestine, a liver, a spleen, a lung, a uterus, a stomach, a kidney, a blood vessel such as an artery and connective tissue, fascia and the like. As used herein, the phrase âhook overâ refers to the ability of the tissue retractor head to contact more than one side of a tissue when applied from the top thereof (i.e. the surface pointed in the direction of the surgical access incision). For example, in the case of an intestine, the tissue retractor head contacts more than 90 degrees of the organ circumference, preferably more than 180 degrees of the organ circumference, most preferably more than 270 degrees of the organ circumference when hooked over the organ.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">The tissue retractor head can be configured as one or more interconnected extensions, or as one or more extensions projecting from a retractor head body. The extension or extensions typically angle away from the longitudinal plane of the handle by 20-60 degrees or by 20-60 degrees from the retractor head body depending on the shape and size of the extension and purpose of the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">The deployed extension can be of any shape or size suitable for hooking over and optionally grasping the organ. Examples include, a prong, a hook, a claw and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">The functional shape of the deployed extension is dictated by one or more mechanisms. In the simplest configuration of the present retractor, the shape of the extension is largely controlled by inflation, i.e. the volume of inflation dictates the extent of deployment of the extension and its shape. In such cases, the extension is formed from a non-compliant balloon of a predetermined inflatable shape and volume.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">For example, inflation of the tissue retractor head to a first predetermined volume can form an extension in a shape of a prong, while further inflation of the prong can form a hook. The transformation of the prong to a hook can take place by simply filling the same inflatable compartment with more fluid or by filling a second compartment which extends the prong into a hook. Alternatively, the shape and size of the extension can be governed by mechanical elements included within, or attached to, the inflatable tissue retractor head. For example, transformation between a prong and hook can take place by retracting a mechanical limiter off of a prong and further inflating the prong to form a hook. Further description of controlled and stepwise deployment of extensions is provided herein below.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">Such controlled, stepwise deployment of the extension provides several advantages in grasping, moving and containing tissue. For example, partial deployment of a prong can be used for sweeping/raking tissue while full deployment as a hook enables grasping/lifting and moving of tissue. Conversely, deflation of a hook extension down to a prong can be used to more easily contain tissue following retraction.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">The tissue retractor head is described in greater detail in WO2013144959 which is fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">The present device further includes a sheath for covering the tissue retractor head when deflated. The sheath is configured for facilitating passage of the tissue retractor head contained therein through a tissue incision (tissue access site) made for a 5 mm trocar port or cannula. In that respect, the sheath preferred embodiment is configured such that it is axially rigid and radially elastic. Axial rigidity enables the surgeon to advance the sheath (and contained retractor head) through the tissue incision site, while the radially elasticity allows the sheath to accommodate and tightly pack the deflated retractor head.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">As is mentioned hereinabove, the detachable handle and the sheath of the present retractor configuration were designed specifically to enable access through narrow access ports (e.g. trocars with an internal diameter of 5 mm or less).</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">According to an aspect of some embodiments of the invention there is provided a tissue retractor device comprising an inflatable head configured at a distal end of a shaft, and a tensile element slidably received within one or more recesses of the head and configured to control and/or maintain an angular position of the head relative to the shaft. In some embodiments, the tensile element (for example in the form of a strap, string, cable or band) extends between the shaft and the head. Optionally, the tensile element is threaded through one or more holes in the inflatable head, for example slidably threaded through holes configured at webbing portions between the extensions of the head.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">In some embodiments, attachment of the tensile element to the head allows the element to slide, at least to some extent, with respect to an outer surface of the head. In an example, the tensile element is wrapped around an extension, and threaded through holes configured in webbing portions of opposing sides of the extension. In some embodiments, sliding of the tensile element relative to the outer surface of the head reduces a risk of tear to the inflated head. Optionally, sliding is limited to an extent in which the element is stretched against the outer surface of the extension enough to provide for bending of the head relative to the shaft and/or to provide for maintaining an angular position of the head relative to the shaft.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">In some embodiments, the tensile element is attached to the shaft by a hook like element. Optionally, the hook like element is axially movable within the shaft, and can be pulled proximally or advanced distally to pull or loosen the tensile element respectively. In some embodiments, two ends of the tensile element are attached to separate hook like elements that are axially movable with respect to the shaft and/or with respect to each other. Optionally, actuation of one of the hook like element (e.g. by pulling it in a proximal direction) pulls the end of the tensile element that is coupled to it, articulating the one or more finger like extensions of the head in a direction corresponding with the pulled end of the tensile element.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">According to an aspect of some embodiments of the invention there is provided a retractor device in which the inflatable head is fixed at a linear position relative to the shaft. In some embodiments, the tensile element is configured to resist bending of the head relative to the shaft, to maintain a substantial 180 degree angle between the inflated head and the shaft. In some embodiments, the tensile element counter acts inflation forces to maintain the linear configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">The construction of the present device, which is referred to herein as device <b>10</b> and its delivery into a body cavity are described in greater detail below with reference to <figref>FIGS. 1A-1E</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>A-B, <b>4</b>A-B and <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>E.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">
        <figref>FIGS. 1A-E</figref> illustrate device <b>10</b> having a shaft <b>12</b> attached to a tissue retractor head <b>18</b> (also referred to herein as head <b>18</b>) at a distal end <b>16</b> of shaft <b>12</b>. Tissue retractor head <b>18</b> is inflatable to form the configurations described above and in WO2013144959.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">Proximal end <b>20</b> of shaft <b>12</b> is attachable to a handle <b>22</b>, the configuration of <figref>FIGS. 1A-B</figref> illustrate a configuration of device <b>10</b> in which shaft <b>12</b> is decoupled from handle <b>22</b> while <figref>FIGS. 1C-E</figref> illustrate a configuration of device <b>10</b> in which shaft <b>12</b> is coupled to handle <b>22</b>. As is further described hereinbelow, such decoupling and coupling of handle <b>22</b> enables delivery of device <b>10</b> through a narrow access port.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">Shaft <b>12</b> is configured as an elongated cylinder about 10-50 cm in length and 3-5.5 mm in diameter. Shaft <b>12</b> can be fabricated from a biocompatible alloy or polymer using techniques well known in the art. Shaft <b>12</b> is preferably hollow and/or includes fluid conduits that extend from a proximal end <b>20</b> to a distal end <b>16</b> thereof. The fluid conduits (not shown) enable inflation of tissue retractor head <b>18</b> with a fluid maintained under pressure in handle <b>22</b> or an external reservoir or pumping element (not shown).</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">Shaft <b>12</b> is preferably rigid but can include joints (e.g. hinges or swivel joints) for articulation of one portion of shaft <b>12</b> with respect to another. Such joints can be positioned close to distal end <b>16</b> or at a middle portion of shaft <b>12</b>. Articulation around the joint can be controlled from handle <b>22</b> via a set of cables, geared transmission, threaded rods or axial plungers running within a lumen of shaft <b>12</b>. It will be appreciated that in a case of a jointed shaft, the fluid conduits contained therein are preferably flexible to allow for articulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">Handle <b>22</b> provides a user interface for controlling operation of device <b>10</b>. Handle <b>22</b> enable a user to maneuver device <b>10</b> and control deployment of tissue retractor head <b>18</b>. For example, handle <b>22</b> can include a release valve for releasing a pressurized fluid stored in handle <b>22</b> (or an external reservoir) through the fluid conduits and into tissue retractor head <b>18</b>. Handle <b>22</b> can also include button for activating release of fluid from an inflated tissue retractor head <b>18</b> (via actuation of valves positioned within handle <b>22</b>) and for actuating mechanical elements attached to, or disposed inside tissue retractor head <b>18</b>, or for angling tissue retractor head <b>18</b> with respect to the longitudinal axis of shaft <b>12</b> as is further described in WO2013144959.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">Device <b>10</b> further includes sheath <b>30</b> for covering and packing head <b>18</b> for delivery through a tissue access site.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">A typical tissue access site for a 5 mm trocar port can be up to 5 mm in diameter (can include multiple convergent incisions). When deflated, head <b>18</b> is roughly 9.5 mm in diameter and includes rolled layers of a pliable material. As such, delivery of head <b>18</b> through a trocar incision can be challenging. Sheath <b>30</b> covers a deflated head <b>18</b> and maintains the pliable folds in a tightly packed configuration. In addition, sheath <b>18</b> (which is described in more detail below with reference to <figref>FIGS. 3A-B</figref>) is configured for easily penetrating the tissue incision without buckling or bending.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">
        <figref>FIGS. 1A-E</figref> also illustrate the various device configurations throughout the delivery stages of head <b>18</b> into a body cavity. <figref>FIGS. 5A-E</figref>, which are described in greater detail below illustrate actual delivery through a tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">In <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>, shaft <b>12</b> is decoupled from handle <b>22</b> and a trocar <b>32</b> is positioned in between, sheath <b>30</b> covers and packs head <b>18</b>. This is the initial configuration of device <b>10</b> prior to delivery. In <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>, trocar <b>32</b> is mounted on shaft <b>12</b> by threading the lumen of trocar <b>32</b> onto shaft <b>12</b> from proximal end <b>20</b>âan end opposite to the typical insertion of trocars. Such mounting can be effected prior to or following delivery of sheath <b>30</b> (and enclosed head <b>18</b>) through a tissue access site (incision). The former approach is preferred since it enables control over the angle of head <b>18</b> while also ensuring that head <b>18</b> can be pulled out through a larger trocar and re-inserted.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">Once trocar <b>32</b> is mounted on the shaft, handle <b>22</b> can be coupled to shaft (<figref>FIG. 1C</figref>) as described in greater detail with reference to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">Sheath <b>30</b> includes a protrusion <b>34</b> (also referred to herein as stop <b>34</b>) for preventing sheath <b>30</b> from completely going through the tissue access site. Thus, during delivery, sheath <b>30</b> lodges within the tissue access site and serves as a guide for advancing head <b>18</b> through sheath <b>30</b> and into the body cavity. As a result, sheath <b>30</b> slides back (in the proximal direction) along shaft <b>12</b> as is shown in <figref>FIG. 1C</figref>. Sheath <b>30</b> can also be pulled back if necessary by grasping stop <b>34</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">Sheath <b>30</b> can then be removed (via stop <b>34</b>) to allow relative movement between trocar <b>32</b> and shaft <b>12</b> (<figref>FIGS. 1D-E</figref>). <figref>FIG. 1E</figref> illustrates a deployed configuration of device <b>10</b> with head <b>18</b> inflated.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">In some embodiments, for example as shown in <figref>FIG. 1E</figref>, the retractor device comprises a mechanical element for controlling angulation of inflatable head <b>18</b> relative to shaft <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, the mechanical element is a tensile element <b>100</b>, for example in the form of a strap, cable, band or string.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">In some embodiments, tensile element <b>100</b> is coupled on one end to the inflatable head <b>18</b>, and on the other end to shaft <b>12</b>. Optionally, tensile element <b>100</b> is coupled to one or more of the finger like extensions <b>104</b> of the head. Optionally, for example as shown herein, the tensile element is wrapped around one of the extensions, such as the central extension. The tensile element may form a lasso like configuration, in which the element is looped around one or more of the finger like extensions.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">In some embodiments, the tensile element is threaded through a webbing portion <b>106</b> between the extensions, as shown for example in <figref>FIG. 5E</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">In some embodiments, tensile element <b>100</b> is configured for defining and/or maintaining an angle Î± between the head <b>18</b> and shaft <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, angle a ranges between, for example, 20-180 degrees, such as 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees or intermediate, larger or smaller angles. In some embodiments, angle Î± (or an angle range) is selected according to the need, for example an angle range suitable for raking tissue, an angle range suitable for lifting tissue, an angle range suitable for pushing tissue, such as between 20-70 degrees, between 50-120 degrees, between 40-90 degrees, or intermediate, larger or smaller ranges.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0110">In an example, element <b>100</b> can be pulled on to decrease angle Î±, and/or loosened in a distal direction to allow angle Î± to increase. In some embodiments, control of angulation of head <b>18</b> with respect to the shaft <b>12</b> using element <b>100</b> is actuated from handle <b>22</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0111">In some embodiments, tensile element <b>100</b> provides a counter force that resists bending of the head relative to the shaft. In some embodiments, element <b>100</b> resists an external bending force that acts on the head, for example force applied to it by the tissue that was raked, pushed, hooked over and/or otherwise moved by the device. In some embodiments, element <b>100</b> resists a natural urge of the inflatable head, when inflated, to extend linearly with respect to the shaft.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0112">In some embodiments, inflatable head <b>18</b> is formed of a soft, elastic material. Optionally, head <b>18</b> does not comprise any rigid components. In some embodiments, a seam <b>108</b> that outlines the head comprises a material more rigid than the material forming the body of the finger like extensions. A potential advantage of a more rigid seam may include reducing a risk of tearing of the member (for example due to over-inflation). Another potential advantage may include maintaining a shape (e.g contour) of the head, even when external forces act upon it. Alternatively, in some embodiments, head <b>18</b> is seamless.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0113">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a mechanism suitable for coupling/decoupling shaft <b>12</b> and handle <b>22</b>. In this embodiment, proximal end <b>20</b> of shaft <b>12</b> includes a slit <b>40</b>, while distal end <b>42</b> of handle <b>22</b> includes an opening <b>44</b> provided with a guiding pin <b>46</b>.

        <figref>FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates shaft <b>12</b> of device <b>10</b> with trocar <b>32</b> mounted on shaft <b>12</b> and sheath <b>30</b> positioned over head <b>18</b>. Handle <b>22</b> is decoupled from shaft <b>12</b> at this stage to enable mounting of trocar <b>32</b> (which is not a part of device <b>10</b>). Once trocar <b>32</b> is mounted handle <b>22</b> (not shown) can be coupled to shaft <b>12</b> as described above. Sheath <b>30</b> is advanced through tissue access site <b>70</b> (<figref>FIG. 5B</figref>) until stop <b>34</b> engages the outer surface of tissue wall <b>72</b>, at this stage sheath <b>30</b> lodges in tissue access site <b>70</b>, further advancing of shaft <b>12</b> into the body cavity frees head <b>18</b> from sheath <b>30</b> and positions head <b>18</b> within the body cavity (<figref>FIG. 5C</figref>). Sheath <b>30</b> is removed and trocar <b>32</b> is advanced into tissue access site <b>70</b> (<figref>FIG. 5D</figref>). Head <b>18</b> is then deployed (inflated and angled) using controls provided on handle <b>22</b> and device <b>10</b> is operated to retract intra-cavity tissue in the manner described in WO2013144959.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">In <figref>FIG. 5E</figref>, head <b>18</b> is angled relative to shaft <b>12</b>, for example being perpendicularly oriented relative to the shaft. Tensile element <b>100</b> extends between shaft <b>12</b> and head <b>18</b>, and in this example is shown to be threaded through designated holes <b>110</b> in webbing portions <b>106</b> connecting the finger like extensions <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">In some embodiments, tensile element <b>100</b> is free to move within hole <b>110</b>, for example to slide back and forth within the hole. Optionally, movement of the tensile element is restricted, for example at a coupling point <b>114</b> between the tensile element and the shaft <b>12</b>. Optionally, tensile element <b>100</b> rests loosely against the finger like extension. A potential advantage of a tensile element that is free to slide against the surface of the finger like extension may include reducing a risk of tear of the inflated extension. Another potential advantage of a tensile element that is not fixedly attached to the head (e.g. an element coupled to the head by an adjustable attachment, for example a tensile element threadedly received within a hole) may include avoiding a rigid attachment, for example comprising a suture and/or other attachment which may damage (e.g. scratch) the tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, tensile element <b>100</b> may be coupled to other portions of the head, for example mounted to (e.g. by being glued to) a proximally facing face <b>112</b> of head <b>18</b>. Optionally, the tensile element is slidably threaded through loops or straps mounted on the face of the head.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0124">In some embodiments, a coupling between tensile element <b>100</b> and head <b>18</b> is selected to provide stability. In the exemplary configuration shown herein, tensile element <b>100</b> is coupled to head <b>18</b> at opposing sides of the central finger like extension <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">In some embodiments, webbing portion <b>106</b> is shaped and/or sized to allow movement, at least to some extent, of the finger like extensions relative to each other. Optionally, webbing portion <b>106</b> is formed of a flexible sheet of material.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0126">Optionally, webbing portion <b>106</b> is formed of a tear resistant material, for example to reduce a risk of tear due to movement of the tensile element within hole <b>110</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, webbing portion <b>106</b> comprises one or more layered sheets, optionally welded. A thickness of a sheet may range between, for example, 0.05 mm to 0.5 mm</p>

        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> shows a distal portion of device <b>10</b>, in which inflatable head <b>18</b> is configured in a linear position relative to shaft <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, tensile element <b>100</b>, for example in the form of a strap, maintains the linear position (in which angle Î± is substantially 180 degrees) by resisting bending of the head. In some embodiments, inflation of head <b>18</b> increases a thickness of the head which may cause at least a part of the head to rise, optionally producing an angle higher than 180 degrees relative to the shaft, and tensile element <b>100</b> counter acts the inflation forces to maintain the head at a flat configuration relative to the shaft.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0128">In some embodiments, in the linear configuration, device <b>10</b> is used for pushing tissue, for example in a distal direction. Additionally or alternatively, in the linear configuration, device <b>10</b> is used for lifting tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0129">In an exemplary embodiment, the head comprises only one finger like extension. In some embodiments, a shape and/or size of the single finger like extension are selected according to the intended use of the device, for example, in a device configured for engaging a liver (such as to rake, lift, push, and/or otherwise move the liver) the extension may comprise a rounded spoon-like shape.</p>

      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0131">In some embodiments, for example as shown herein, tensile element <b>100</b> (for example in the form of a strap) is wrapped around one or more of the finger like extensions such as extension <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the free ends such as <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> of the tensile element <b>100</b> extend to shaft <b>12</b>. Optionally, the ends are received within one or more slots <b>118</b> in shaft <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0132">In some embodiments, the device is configured to be maintained in a constant linear configuration (angle Î± of approximately 180 degrees). Optionally, the constant angle is maintained by tensile element <b>100</b>, for example by tensioning the element enough to resist bending of the inflatable head <b>18</b> relative to shaft <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0133">Alternatively, in some embodiments, tensile element <b>100</b> provides for angulation of head <b>18</b> relative to shaft <b>12</b>. Optionally, angulation is within the range of 20-180 degrees. Additionally or alternatively, angulation is within the range of 20-340 degrees.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0134">In some embodiments, head <b>18</b> is configured to grasp tissue in between the finger like extensions, for example in a tweezer-like motion. Optionally, one or more of the finger like extensions can be moved relative to each other. For example, central extension <b>104</b> can be moved towards side extension <b>120</b>, such that a distance <b>122</b> between the extensions is reduced. In some embodiments, control of the grasping tweezer-like movement is provided by tensile element <b>100</b>.</p>

      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0139">In some embodiments, tensile element <b>100</b>, for example the free ends <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> of the element are received within one or more slots <b>128</b> of shaft <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, the tensile element hooks onto an element <b>126</b> that is axially moveable within shaft <b>12</b>, for example to enable pulling and/or loosening the tensile element.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0140">Optionally, element <b>126</b> is shaped to trap the tensile element within it, keep the tensile element attached to the shaft so that even in a situation in which tensile element <b>100</b> is torn or otherwise damaged, the tensile element can be entirely retracted from the body.</p>
