    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to an acrylic resin emulsion which is advantageously used for an aqueous inkjet ink.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In an inkjet recording method, an aqueous ink composition is jetted in a liquid droplet form onto a substrate from small holes based on electric signals which induce thermal or mechanical pulses. In response to the pulses, the ink is jetted in the form of liquid droplets, which are forced toward specific positions on a surface of the substrate. After once being applied to the surface, the liquid droplets are required to stay at the positions and maintain their dimensions to form an image with a proper resolution. Thereafter, the liquid droplets are dried and sufficiently fixed to the surface of the substrate.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">With the recent innovative progress of the inkjet recording technique, the inkjet recording method is employed for higher-definition image recording (image printing) which used to be an application filed of photography and offset printing. Inkjet printers including a higher-viscosity ink head have been developed, which permit formation of clearer images with the use of a higher-viscosity ink. Hence, there is a demand for the higher-viscosity ink to be used with the higher-viscosity ink head.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">An ink composition (PLT1) which contains an aqueous vehicle, a self-dispersive pigment, a silicone-containing surfactant and a polymer having a specific glass transition temperature (Tg), and an ink composition (PLT2) which contains at least a polymer, glycerin, a tackifier and water, for example, have been developed as aqueous inkjet ink compositions to be used for inkjet inks. In PLT2, a method of controlling the viscosity of the ink with the use of the tackifier is disclosed.</p>

    <heading id="h-00006-en">TECHNICAL PROBLEM</heading>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">However, the aqueous inkjet ink composition employing a resin emulsion as described in PLT1 generally has a lower viscosity and, therefore, cannot be applied to the higher-viscosity ink head as it is.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">It is also conceivable to increase the viscosity of the ink with the use of the tackifier as described in PLT2, for example, in order to apply the ink to the higher-viscosity ink head. The aqueous inkjet ink composition imparted with a higher viscosity with the use of the tackifier can be used for the higher-viscosity ink head, but problematically has a lower glossiness after the printing.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In view of the foregoing, the present invention provides an acrylic resin emulsion to be used for an aqueous inkjet ink composition excellent in glossiness and other ink properties and imparted with a higher viscosity without the use of a tackifier.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In view of the foregoing, inventors of the present invention conducted intensive studies. As a result, the inventors found that, if an emulsion to be used for an aqueous inkjet ink composition contains a particulate acrylic resin and an acid-group-containing monomer is present at a higher content ratio in surface regions of particles of the particulate acrylic resin, the aqueous inkjet ink composition has a higher viscosity and yet has an excellent glossiness.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">According to the present invention, an acrylic resin emulsion for an aqueous inkjet ink is provided, which contains a particulate acrylic resin having an acid value of 1 to 100 mgKOH/g, wherein an acid-group-containing monomer is present at a content mole ratio (As) in surface regions of particles of the particulate acrylic resin and present at a content mole ratio (At) in the overall acrylic resin particles as measured with a <sup>1</sup>H spin diffusion time of 5 ms, and a ratio (As/At) of the content mole ratio (As) to the content mole ratio (At) is not less than 9.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">According to the present invention, an aqueous inkjet ink composition is also provided, which contains the acrylic resin emulsion for the aqueous inkjet ink, a pigment, a solvent and a wetting agent.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The aqueous inkjet ink composition employing the inventive acrylic resin emulsion for the aqueous inkjet ink has a higher viscosity and, therefore, can be used for a higher-viscosity ink head. Further, the aqueous inkjet ink composition is excellent in glossiness and other ink properties in good balance and, therefore, can be used for high-definition image recording.</p>

    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The present invention will hereinafter be described in detail.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In the present invention, the term " (meth) acryl" means acryl or methacryl, and the term " (meth) acryloyl" means acryloyl or methacryloyl. The term "(meth)acrylate" means acrylate or methacrylate.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The inventive acrylic resin emulsion is an acrylic resin emulsion for an aqueous inkjet ink, and contains a particulate acrylic resin having an acid value of 1 to 100 mgKOH/g. An acid-group-containing monomer is present at a content mole ratio (As) in surface regions of particles of the particulate acrylic resin and present at a content mole ratio (At) in the overall acrylic resin particles as measured with a <sup>1</sup>H spin diffusion time of 5 ms, and the ratio (As/At) of the content mole ratio (As) to the content mole ratio (At) is not less than 9.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">First, the acrylic resin to be contained in the inventive acrylic resin emulsion for the aqueous inkjet ink will be described.</p>
    <heading id="h-00009-en">&lt;Acrylic Resin&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The acrylic resin is required to have an acid value of 1 to 100 mgKOH/g, preferably 1 to 50 mgKOH/g, particularly preferably 1 to 30 mgKOH/g.</p>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">If the acid value is excessively high, an ink coating film formed by using the emulsion containing the acrylic resin is liable to have a reduced water resistance. If the acid value is excessively low, the particulate acrylic resin tends to be less stable.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The acid value may be controlled within the aforementioned range by controlling the blending amount of the acid-group-containing monomer to be described later.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The ratio (As/At) of the content mole ratio (As) of the acid-group-containing monomer in the surface regions of the acrylic resin particles to the content mole ratio (At) of the acid-group-containing monomer in the overall acrylic resin particles is required to be not less than 9 as measured with a <sup>1</sup>H spin diffusion time of 5 ms. The ratio (As/At) is preferably 10 to 100, particularly preferably 11 to 80, more preferably 12 to 60, further more preferably 13 to 40.</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">If the As/At ratio is excessively low, the aqueous inkjet ink composition employing the resulting acrylic resin emulsion for the aqueous inkjet ink is liable to have a reduced viscosity.</p>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The content mole ratio (As) of the acid-group-containing monomer in the surface regions of the acrylic resin particles is preferably 1 to 100, particularly preferably 2 to 80, more preferably 10 to 60, as measured with a <sup>1</sup>H spin diffusion time of 5 ms.</p>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">If the value (As) is excessively great, an ink coating film formed by using the emulsion containing the acrylic resin particles is liable to have a reduced water resistance. If the value (As) is excessively low, the particulate acrylic resin tends to be less stable.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The content mole ratio (At) of the acid-group-containing monomer in the overall acrylic resin particles is preferably 0.1 to 11, particularly preferably 0.5 to 8, more preferably 1 to 5.</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">If the value (At) is excessively great, an ink coating film formed by using the emulsion containing the acrylic resin particles is liable to have a reduced water resistance. If the value (At) is excessively low, the particulate acrylic resin tends to be less stable.</p>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Examples of the acid-group-containing monomer include carboxyl-group-containing monomers, sulfonic-acid-group-containing monomers and phosphoric-acid-group-containing monomers, among which the carboxyl-group-containing monomers are preferred because the viscosity increasing effect can be easily provided.</p>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The content ratio (As) of the acid-group-containing monomer in the surface regions of the particles and the content ratio (At) of the acid-group-containing monomer in the overall particles can be calculated by analyzing NMR spectra.</p>
    <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Where the acid group is a carboxyl group, for example, a resonance peak for the carboxyl group in the carboxyl-group-containing monomer appears at 190 to 180 ppm in a <sup>13</sup>C spectrum. On the other hand, a resonance peak for the carbonyl group in the ester structure of the acrylate monomer appears at 180 to 170 ppm in the <sup>13</sup>C spectrum. The formulation of the copolymer can be determined based on the area ratio of these two resonance peaks.</p>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">As described above, the content ratio (As) is a content ratio of the acid-group-containing monomer in the surface regions of the acrylic resin particles as measured with an NMR <sup>1</sup>H spin diffusion time of 5 ms. The surface regions of the acrylic resin particles to be subjected to the measurement, i.e., the depths of the surface regions as measured from the surfaces of the particles, are an important factor. The specific depths of the surface regions of the acrylic resin particles can be calculated from the following mathematical expression (MATH-1): <maths id="maths-00001-en" num="(MATH-1)"><math display="block"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">L</mi><mo>=</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">0.816</mn><mo>×</mo><msup><mrow><mfenced><mi mathvariant="normal">τd</mi></mfenced></mrow><mrow><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></math><img id="img-00001-en" wi="94" he="10" img-content="math" file="imgb0001.tif" img-format="tif" /></maths> wherein L is the depth (nm) of the surface region of an acrylic resin particle as measured from the surface of the particle, 0.816 is a coefficient, and τd (ms) is the <sup>1</sup>H spin diffusion time (Reference: <nplcit id="ncit-00002" npl-type="s"><text>Masuda et al., Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (2003) 23, 198</text></nplcit>).</p>
    <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">That is, where the NMR <sup>1</sup>H spin diffusion time for the content ratio (As) is 5 ms in the mathematical expression (MATH-1), the depth from the surface of the acrylic resin particle is about 1.8 nm. That is, the content ratio (As) is the content mole ratio of the acid-group-containing monomer in a surface region having a depth of about 1.8 mm as measured from the surface of the acrylic resin particle.</p>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">On the other hand, the content ratio (At) is the content mole ratio of the acid-group-containing monomer in the overall acrylic resin particles, and can be determined by analyzing the NMR spectrum as described above.</p>
    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The NMR spectra are typically determined through measurement by a common NMR spectrometer, e.g., an NMR spectrometer (AVANCE III 400WB available from Bruker Corporation). The content ratio (As) can be determined by the method described in <nplcit id="ncit-00003" npl-type="s"><text>Polymer Preprints Japan Vol. 60, No. 2, 3086 (2011</text></nplcit>) shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, and the content ratio (At) can be determined with the use of CP/MAS (Cross Polarization Magic Angle Spinning).</p>

    <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">If the average particle diameter is excessively great, the resulting coating film tends to have poorer glossiness. If the average particle diameter is excessively small, a greater amount of an emulsifier is required in the production, resulting in inefficient economy.</p>
    <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The average particle diameter is a volume average particle diameter which is determined through cumulant fitting of an autocorrelation function obtained at a temperature of 23°C with a scatter angle of 90 degrees by a dynamic light scattering method (DLS) . "NICOMP 380" available from Particle Sizing Systems Inc. may be used as a measuring apparatus.</p>

    <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The acrylic resin having the aforementioned properties may be prepared by a single-stage polymerization method or by a two or more stage polymerization method. The two or more stage polymerization method is more preferred, because the localization of the acid-group-containing monomer in the surface regions of the particles can be promoted by increasing the blending proportion of the acid-group-containing monomer at a latter polymerization stage.</p>
    <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In the case of the single-stage polymerization method, the content ratio of an essentially water-soluble acid-group-containing monomer for the particulate acrylic resin having an acid value of 1 to 100 mgKOH/g is increased to promote the localization of the monomer in the surface regions of the particles, whereby the emulsion containing the acrylic resin particles can be prepared as desired by the polymerization.</p>
    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In the case of the two-stage polymerization method (where n is 2), for example, a first emulsion is prepared through emulsion polymerization of a first-stage monomer component, and then a second-stage monomer component containing the acid-group-containing monomer in a greater proportion is added to the first emulsion to be thereby polymerized in the first emulsion through emulsion polymerisation.</p>

Thereafter, the resulting sheet was kept in an oven at 100°C for 20 minutes, whereby a film was formed and dried. Thus, a coating surface was provided.</p>
    <p id="p-00161-en" num="0161">The 20-degree glossiness and the 60-degree glossiness of the coating surface thus provided were measured by means of a glossiness meter (Micro-TRI-gloss 4520 available from BYK Gardner GmbH).</p>
    <p id="p-00162-en" num="0162">The evaluation was based on the following criteria, and the results are shown below in Table 4.</p>
    <p id="p-00163-en" num="0163">The PVC sheet (substrate sheet) had a 20-degree glossiness of 70 (Δ) and a 60-degree glossiness of 90 (○).</p>

    <p id="p-00166-en" num="0166">As can be understood from the results shown in Table 4, the aqueous inkjet ink composition produced by using the acrylic resin emulsion (E1) of Example 1 for the aqueous inkjet ink had a higher viscosity and the inkjet ink produced from this composition had excellent glossiness. This is because the acrylic resin emulsion (E1) was prepared by using the monomer component containing the acid-group-containing monomer in a greater amount in the final polymerization stage than in the other polymerization stage and, therefore, the acrylic resin particles each had a higher acid value in a surface region thereof, and the higher-acid-value surface portions were dissolved to increase the interaction between the emulsion particles.</p>
    <p id="p-00167-en" num="0167">In contrast, the aqueous inkjet ink composition (C1') produced by using the acrylic resin emulsion (E1') of Comparative Example 1 for the aqueous inkjet ink had a lower viscosity and, even when the viscosity of the aqueous inkjet ink composition was increased by the addition of the tackifier, the resulting aqueous inkjet ink composition (C2') had poorer glossiness.</p>
    <p id="p-00168-en" num="0168">While specific forms of the embodiment of the present invention have been shown in the aforementioned inventive example, the inventive example is merely illustrative of the invention but not limitative of the invention. It is contemplated that various modifications apparent to those skilled in the art could be made within the scope of the invention.</p>
    <p id="p-00169-en" num="0169">The aqueous inkjet ink composition produced by using the inventive acrylic resin emulsion for the aqueous inkjet ink is imparted with a higher viscosity without the use of a tackifier and is excellent in glossiness and other ink properties. Therefore, the inventive acrylic resin emulsion is particularly useful for an aqueous inkjet ink composition for use with a higher-viscosity ink printer head.</p>
