      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of culturing bacterial organisms belonging to the family Anaplasmataceae in mammalian embryonic or fetal cells, such as feline embryonic or fetal cells. In particular, the present invention is directed to growth of bacterial organisms belonging to the family Anaplasmataceae including organisms belonging to the genera <i>Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Neorickettsia</i>, and <i>Wolbachieae</i>. The bacterial organisms may be cultured in mammalian embryonic or fetal cells, such as feline embryonic or fetal host cells. Bacterial material cultured according to the methods described herein may be used as the basis for vaccines against diseases associated with the Anaplasmataceae bacteria.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The bacteria of the family Anaplasmataceae are obligate intracellular parasites. As such, these microorganisms are often difficult to grow and the diseases they cause are difficult to diagnose. Because of the difficulty of growing these microorganisms, large-scale preparation of vaccine antigens is costly and sometimes impossible. The bacteria of the Anaplasmataceae family are pathogenic agents of vector-transmitted diseases of human and animals. They are mostly transmitted by invertebrate vectors such as ticks. Within the family Anaplasmataceae, the microorganisms of the genera <i>Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Neorickettsia </i>and <i>Wolbachieae </i>are causative agents of vector-transmitted diseases and are difficult to grow, especially on a large-scale. Bacterial species belonging to the genus <i>Rickettsieae </i>are not included within the family Anaplasmataceae.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Anaplasmosis is a major tick-borne disease of cattle endemic in the United States. The causative agent, <i>Anaplasma marginale</i>, invades and multiplies in erythrocytes of cattle, causing mild to severe anemia. Annual mortality and morbidity due to anaplasmosis impacting beef cattle herds has caused millions of dollars worth of damage due to, for example; weight loss during acute infections and increased veterinary costs. See e.g., Palmer in Veterinary Protozoan and Hemoparasite Vaccines, J. G. Wright (Ed.) CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, Fla. 1989.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">
        <i>Anaplasma phagocytophilum </i>causes tick borne fever in sheep, cattle, and bison, and is vecotred by <i>I. ricins</i>. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,284,238, which is fully incorporated by reference herein. In contrast to <i>A. marginale </i>which infects red blood cells, <i>A. phagocytophilum </i>infects granulocytes.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">
        <i>Ehrlichia </i>bacteria are closely related to <i>Anaplasma </i>species. Those species for which a biological vector is known are transmitted by ticks, such as for <i>E. canis</i>. While <i>Anaplasma phagocytophilum </i>prefers to infect granulocytes in its mammalian host, <i>Ehrlichia canis </i>prefers to infect mononuclear white blood cells. Typically, <i>Anaplasma </i>and <i>Ehrlichia </i>are contained within membrane-bound vacuoles of their respective host cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The first <i>Ehrlichia </i>species recognized was <i>E. canis</i>. It occurs in all areas of the world where the vector tick, <i>Rhipicephalus sanguineus </i>(the brown dog tick), lives. The disease it causes is sometimes called canine tropical pancytopenia. It is a problem especially in all warm areas of the world, e.g., the southern U.S., Central and South America, the Mediterranean, and South Asia. <i>Ehrlichia canis </i>may be cultivated in the dog cell line DH82 as well as human-dog hybrid cell lines (See Rikihisa, Y. 1991. Clinical Microbiology Reviews, 4:286). Various strains of <i>E. canis </i>are listed in U.S. Patent Application No. 2006/0188524, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. <i>Ehrlichia chaffeensis </i>is associated with human ehrlichiosis. See Maeda, K. et al., 1987, N. Eng. J. Med. 316:853; Dawson, J. E. et al., 1991, J. Clin. Microbiol. 29:2741. <i>E. chaffeensis </i>can also be cultured in DH82 cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">
        <i>Neorickettsia </i>bacteria are closely related to <i>Ehrlichia </i>and <i>Anaplasma </i>bacteria. <i>Neorickettsia </i>species include <i>N. risticii </i>and <i>N. sennetsu </i>(both of which were previously classified in the genus <i>Ehrlichia. N. risticii </i>is the causative agent of Potomac horse fever.

      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Infections with bacterial organisms of the Anaplasmataceae family may be diagnosed by direct microscopic examination and/or serodiagnosis. Treatment with antibiotics may be effective. Equine vaccines to protect against <i>N. risticii </i>are commercially available. See Compendium of Veterinary Products, 6th ed., Aurora Arrioja, ed., North American Compendiums, Ltd., Port Huron, MI (2001). At least one cattle vaccine to protect against anaplasmosis is also commercially available. See Id. However, vaccines have not been manufactured and sold for large scale prevention of other diseases caused by bacterial organisms such as, for example, <i>E. canis</i>.

      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Because growth of bacterial species belonging to the Anaplasmataceae family in host cells has met with only limited success and apparently has not translated into an abundant supply of vaccines, there remains a general need to develop culturing systems for growing such bacterial species to facilitate the study of these pathogenic microorganisms and for the development of vaccines to guard against the diseases they cause. There is also a need to develop a large scale culturing system for preparation of large amounts of antigen from such microorganisms for use in diagnostics and vaccines.</p>

      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The present invention broadly relates to culturing bacterial organisms belonging to the Anaplasmataceae family in mammalian embryonic or fetal host cells. The cultured bacterial organisms can be used as a vaccine against diseases caused by the bacterial organisms. The antigen used in the vaccine can be made from the bacterial organisms isolated from the mammalian host cells. Alternatively, the antigen used in the vaccine can be made from cultures of the mammalian host cells infected with the bacterial organisms. The bacterial organisms (or the host cell if present) can be inactivated. Alternatively, the bacterial organisms can be attenuated live such that they replicate within an animal to which they are administered one or more times without causing the disease state typical of the non-attenuated pathogenic form of the bacterial organism.</p>

      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">According to the present invention, bacterial organisms of the Anaplasmataceae family are grown in mammalian embryonic or fetal host cells. As used herein, âhost cellsâ are cells that bacterial organisms of the Anaplasmataceae family can infect and in which the bacterial organisms can replicate. Non-limiting examples of mammalian embryonic or fetal host cells include human, feline, canine, murine, swine, bovine, ovine, simian or equine embryonic or fetal cells. As used herein, âinfected host cellsâ refer to host cells that contain one or more Anaplasmataceae bacteria.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The host cells can be derived from a single cell isolated from mammalian embryonic or fetal tissue. For example, the cells can be derived from embryonic feline, canine, bovine, equine, murine, swine, simian or human tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In one embodiment of the present invention, bacterial species belonging to the Anaplasmataceae are cultured in host cells that are derived from non-human mammalian embryonic or fetal tissue. A non-limiting examples of feline embryonic or fetal cells that may be used according to the present invention include feline embryonic fibroblasts (FEF) cells, FEA feline embryonic cells (University of Glasgow, Glagow, Scotland; as described in Jarrett, O. et al., <i>J. gen. Prot </i>20:169-175 (1973)), and <i>felis catus </i>whole fetus cells (FCWF-4, American Type Culture Collection, P.O. Box 1549 Manassas, Va. 20108, United States (hereafter, âATCCâ) deposit CRL-2787).</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The bacterial organisms cultured according to the present invention may be used for vaccines, diagnostics or further research including, for example, production of quantities of biological molecules for isolation and study. Accordingly, the bacteria cultured according to present invention may be formulated in a vaccine for administration to a mammal to prevent infection or ameliorate disease caused by the bacterial organism. For example, the bacteria cultured in the host cells could be <i>Ehrlichia canis </i>for use in a vaccine to be given to canines to prevent or ameliorate canine ehrlichiosis.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Hence, the present invention also relates to immunogenic compositions or vaccines based upon material cultured according to the present invention. The therapeutic agent (also referred to as the antigen, active agent, or the immunogenic composition) that can serve as the basis for a vaccine can be one or more of the following:</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">a) harvested cultures of host cells that are infected with Anaplasmataceae bacteria;</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">b) extracts or fractions of (a) that are enhanced with respect to the concentration of the Anaplasmataceae bacteria contained within the infected host cells;</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">c) Anaplasmataceae bacteria enhanced extracts of (a) that contain remnants of the host cells;</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">d) Anaplasmataceae bacteria extracts of (a) that do not contain remnants of the host cells; or</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">e) isolated Anaplasmataceae bacterial immunogens.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">âIsolatedâ when used herein means removed from its naturally occurring environment. Hence, isolated Anaplasmataceae bacterial cells broadly include those which have been removed from their naturally occurring environments, which environments can include arthropods, insects or whole live or dead infected mammals. Isolated Anaplasmataceae bacterial cells include thus; that, are contained within mammalian tissue that has been removed from a Anaplasmataceae bacteria-infected mammal. Isolated Anaplasmataceae bacterial cells also include those that are completely or partially separated from mammalian cells of a Anaplasmataceae bacteria-infected mammal, such as from lysing the host cells. Isolated Anaplasmataceae bacterial cells also include those that are contained within host cells as described herein, or separated partially or completely therefrom. Isolated Anaplasmataceae bacterial cells also include those that are substantially free of other microorganisms, e.g., in a culture.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">âIsolatedâ as used in âisolated Anaplasmataceae bacterial immunogensâ refers to bacterial immunogens that have been completely or partially separated from their respective source Anaplasmataceae bacteria. Compositions of isolated Anaplasmataceae bacterial immunogens can include some whole intact Anaplasmataceae bacteria, portions or components of Anaplasmataceae bacteria, whole intact host cell, and/or portions or components of host cells. Isolated Anaplasmataceae bacterial immunogens also include compositions that are enriched with respect to one or more Anaplasmataceae bacterial biomolecules.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">âAnaplasmataceae bacterial immunogensâ as used herein includes whole Anaplasmataceae bacteria that are inactivated or modified live bacteria. Anaplasmataceae bacterial immunogen as used herein can also include proteins (lipoproteins, membranous proteins, cytosolic proteins), immunogenic fragments of such proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, saccharides, lipopolysaccharides or other biological molecules derived from the Anaplasmataceae bacteria. Anaplasmataceae bacterial immunogen can be whole Anaplasmataceae bacterial cells or parts thereof that are present in host cells, wherein both the bacterial and host cells are killed or inactivated. Anaplasmataceae bacterial immunogen can also be whole Anaplasmataceae bacterial cells or parts thereof that are present in host cells, wherein the bacterial or host cells are not killed or inactivated.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The skilled artisan is generally familiar with the techniques by which bacterial or host cells can be killed or inactivated. Such techniques include, physical, chemical and biological means. Non-limiting examples of inactivation techniques include sonication, freeze-thaw techniques, pressure, treatment with heat, chemicals or enzymes. Non-limiting examples of chemical inactivation agents include treatment with binary ethyleneamine (BEA) and formalin (formaldehyde solution).</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">As stated above, the material cultured according to the present invention can be used to make antigen for vaccines. As used herein, the term âvaccine(s)â means and refers to a product, the administration of which is intended to elicit an immune response that can prevent and/or lessen the severity of one or more infectious diseases. A vaccine contains an antigen (or, âactive agent,â âimmunogen,â âtherapeutic agent,â or âimmunogenic compositionâ) that may be material cultured according to the present invention including a host cell infected with Anaplasmataceae bacteria, whole intact Anaplasmataceae bacteria, or bacterial fractions or parts or biomolecules of a Anaplasmataceae bacteria that act to stimulate the immune system in an animal. An antigen may be a live attenuated or killed preparation of Anaplasmataceae bacteria-infected host cells, live attenuated or killed Anaplasmataceae bacteria, living irradiated cells, crude fractions or purified Anaplasmataceae bacterial immunogens. Hence, a vaccine can comprise enriched, isolated or purified antigen. The vaccines can be made from inactivated or killed cultures of Anaplasmataceae infected host cells, or inactivated or killed Anaplasmataceae bacteria.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">A vaccine may also comprise a combination of antigens from more than one Anaplasmataceae bacterial species or from other pathogens (e.g. viral, bacterial parasitical or fungal) as described further below.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Vaccines made from material cultured according to the present invention comprise a therapeutically effective amount of the antigen. In the context of this disclosure, a âtherapeutically effective amountâ refers to an amount of an antigen or vaccine that would induce an immune response in a mammal receiving the antigen or vaccine which is adequate to prevent or ameliorate signs or symptoms of disease, including adverse health effects or complications thereof, caused by infection with a pathogenic Anaplasmataceae bacterium. Humoral immunity or cell-mediated immunity or both humoral and cell-mediated immunity may be induced. The immunogenic response of an animal to a vaccine may be evaluated, e.g., indirectly through measurement of antibody titers, via microscopic analysis, or directly through monitoring signs and symptoms after challenge with wild type strain. The protective immunity conferred by a vaccine may be evaluated by measuring, e.g., reduction in clinical signs such as mortality, morbidity, body temperature and overall physical condition and overall health and performance of the subject. The amount of a vaccine that is therapeutically effective may vary depending on the particular virus used, or the condition of the subject, and may be determined by one skilled in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The material cultured according to the present invention can also be used to make immunogenic compositions that stimulate an immune response in a subject mammal to which the compositions are administered. Such compositions can be used to identify antigens that can serve as the basis of a vaccine. Thus, for example, immunogenic compositions comprising material cultured according to, the present invention can be administered to a subject mammal. Thereafter, the antibody titer of the subject mammal can be monitored and candidate Anaplasmataceae bacterial antigens can be selected for use or further study in vaccines. Immunoactive compositions of the present invention include compositions that stimulate a humoral immune response and/or a cell-mediated immune response in the subject receiving a vaccine.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">As used herein, an âimmune responseâ refers to the subject mammal's active immunity response due to having received one or more vaccines based upon material cultured according to the methods described herein. The immune response can include the production of one or more antibody in response to the antigen or immunogen present in the vaccine. âImmune responseâ in a subject refers to the development of a humoral immune response, a cellular immune response, or a humoral and a cellular immune response to an antigen. Immune responses may be determined using standard immunoassays and neutralization assays, which are known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Vaccines made from material cultured according to the present invention can be used to prevent infection within a subject mammal, protect a subject mammal, or treat a subject mammal.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">âPreventing infectionâ and like terms means to prevent or inhibit the replication of the bacteria which cause the identified disease, to inhibit transmission of the bacteria or virus, or to prevent the bacteria from establishing itself in its host animal, or to alleviate the symptoms of the disease caused by infection. The treatment is considered therapeutic if there is a reduction in bacterial load.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">âProtectionâ, âProtectingâ, and the like, as used herein with respect to a bacteria, means that the vaccine prevents or reduces the symptoms of the disease caused by the organism from which the antigen(s) used in the vaccine is derived. The terms âprotectionâ and âprotectingâ and the like, also mean that the vaccine may be used to âtreatâ the disease or one of more symptoms of the disease that already exists in a subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">âTreatingâ refers to reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing a disorder, condition or disease to which such term applies, or to preventing one or more symptoms of such disorder, condition or disease. Treating also refers to accelerating the recovery from an infection by one or more Anaplasmataceae organisms. âTreatmentâ refers to the act of âtreatingâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Hence, vaccines made from material cultured according to the present invention can be used to prevent Anaplasmataceae bacterial infection in a subject mammal, protect a subject mammal against Anaplasmataceae bacteria, and treat a subject mammal for Anaplasmataceae bacterial infection. Such prevention, protection or treatment can include (without limitation) reducing or eliminating the risk of infection by the pathogenic Anaplasmataceae organism, ameliorating or alleviating the symptoms of an infection by such Anaplasmataceae organism, reduction in Anaplasmataceae bacterial load, decreasing incidence or duration of Anaplasmataceae infections, reducing acute phase serum protein levels of Anaplasmataceae bacteria, reduced rectal temperatures, and/or increase in food uptake and/or growth, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">âPharmaceutically acceptableâ as used herein refers to substances (e.g., adjuvants, immunostimulants, carriers, diluents, emulsifying or stabilizing agents), which are within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of subjects without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the Like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit-to-risk ratio, and effective for their intended use. Pharmaceutically acceptable substances do not interfere with the effectiveness of the therapeutic agent and are not toxic to the subject to whom it is administered.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">âSubjectâ or âsubject mammalâ refers to any animal having an immune system, which includes mammals such as humans, cats, cattle, horses, swine, and dogs.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Material cultured according to the present invention can also be used in diagnostic applications to diagnose the presence of diseases or illnesses caused by Anaplasmataceae bacteria. Non-limiting examples of such diagnostic applications include use of bacterial fractions, proteins or other biomolecules in antibody binding assays. The bacterial fractions, proteins or other biomolecules may also be used to generate polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies for such assays.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Host Cell Growth</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Host cells for culturing bacterial organisms according to the present invention are first prepared prior to infecting with the desired bacterial organism. A sample of an isolated feline embryonic cell line is seeded into media for either suspended or adherent growth. As used herein, adherent growth conditions wherein a layer of cells coats surfaces contained within the vesicle in which the cells are cultured. The surfaces can include the interior surface of the vesicle itself, or surfaces of glass or polymeric beads contained within the vesicle to increase surface area. Microcarriers can also be used to increase surface area and host cell growth. In contrast to adherent growth, it may be possible to grow the host cells in suspension, in which the host cells need not bind to surfaces within the culturing vesicle.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The skilled artisan is generally familiar with the varieties of culturing media that may be used to grow up the host cells. The host cell growth media may be derived from animals. Alternatively, the host cell growth media may be vegetable or yeast based, and may be animal protein-free. The growth media may be derived from soy bean extracts or from other protein-rich plants or protein-rich plant food products including, for example, legumes. Non-limiting example of specific media useful for growing host cells include Eagle's Minimal Essential Media (MEM), Glasgow-Minimal Essential Media, RPMI1640, OptiMEM, AIM V.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The growth media can contain or be supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS), tryptose solution, lacto-albumin hydrosolate solution, L-glutamine, sodium bicarbonate; lactalbumin hydrolysate, Polymyxin B, sodium pyruvate, glucose, magnesium sulfate.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Fresh growth media can be refed or replenished to the host cells prior to or after infection or exposure of the host cells to the Anaplasmataceae bacteria.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Cells can be grown at 36-38Â° C. for 2-9 days at 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Infecting the Host Cells</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The host cells may be exposed to or infected with bacterial organisms of the Anaplasmataceae family by bringing the host cells into contact with other eukaryotic cells known to be infected with the bacterial organisms. The skilled artisan is familiar with determining whether such other eukaryotic cells from a mammal, for example, are infected with such bacterial organisms. The infected mammalian cells may be derived from any tissue, including the spleen, liver, pancreas, lungs, heart or other muscle tissue, brain, gall bladder, blood, kidneys, lymph nodes or stomach. The infected mammalian cells may be prepared from a tissue extract via blender homogenization in an appropriate isotonic solution. The homogenate can then be used to innoculate (i.e., infect) a culture of host cells, applied as a layer over the host cells or simply brought into contact with them.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Alternatively, the host cells may be exposed to or infected with isolated bacterial organisms of the Anaplasmataceae family. The skilled artisan is familiar with techniques of isolating such bacterial organisms, or can obtain stocks of isolated bacterial organisms from a biological depository.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The growth medium used to prepare host cells prior to contact with Anaplasmataceae bacteria may be the same as the medium used to propagate the host cells after such contact. The Anaplasmataceae bacteria-exposed (or infected) host cells may be cultured for up to 95 days, up to 35 days, or for about 5 to 10 days, to achieve a titer of â§1Ã10<sup>4 </sup>TCID<sub>50 </sub>(Tissue Culture Infectious Dose), and then the culture may be harvested and processed.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Harvesting</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The Anaplasmataceae bacterial infected host cells may be harvested by collecting the tissue cell culture fluids and/or cells. The host cells may be harvested from the media (and the culture vesicles) with the Anaplasmataceae bacterial cells contained with the walls of the host cells. Alternatively, during harvesting the concentration of the Anaplasmataceae bacteria may be enriched by techniques that improve the liberation of the infective bacterial cells from the growth substrate, e.g. sonication, freeze thawing, heating or chemical or selective enzymatic lysis of the eukaryotic host cells. An enriched harvest of Anaplasmataceae bacteria can include material that is free of host cells or host cell material. Alternatively, an enriched harvest of Anaplasmataceae bacteria can include material that contains host cells or host cell material.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Inactivating</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">The skilled artisan is generally familiar with the techniques by which bacterial or host cells can be killed or inactivated. Such techniques include, physical, chemical and biological means. Non-limiting examples of inactivation techniques include sonication, freeze-thaw techniques, pressure, treatment with heat, chemicals or enzymes. Non-limiting examples of chemical inactivation agents include treatment with binary ethyleneimine (BEI), formalin (formaldehyde solution), beta-propiolactone, merthiolate, gluteraldehyde, sodium dodecyl sulfate, or the like, or a mixture thereof. The host cells can also be inactivated by heat or psoralen in the presence of ultraviolet light. These chemical inactivation agents or physical inactivation means can also be used to inactivate the Anaplasmataceae bacterial cells after their having been extracted or separated from the host cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Formulating</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The inactivated, infected host cells or enriched Anaplasmataceae bacterial cells can serve as the antigen and may be formulated as a liquid suspension or may be lyophilized for its use in the preparation of a vaccine against diseases caused by Anaplasmataceae organisms. Material cultured according to the present invention can be formulated with any pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants, immunostimulants, carriers, diluents, emulsifying or stabilizing agents, non-limiting examples of which are discussed below. The skilled artisan, however, would recognize that other adjuvants, immunostimulants, carriers, diluents, emulsifying agents or stabilizing agents may be used in formulating vaccines based upon material cultured according to the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">Adjuvants &amp; Immunostimulants</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">An adjuvant in general is a substance that boosts the immune response of the target in a non-specific manner. Many different adjuvants are known in the art. Non-limiting examples of adjuvants that may be used in the formulation of a vaccine made with material cultured according to the present invention include aluminum salts (e.g., alum, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, aluminum oxide), cholesterol, monophosphoryl lipid A adjuvants, amphigen, tocophenols, monophosphenyl lipid A, muramyl dipeptide, oil emulsions, glucans, carbomers, block copolymers, Avridine lipid-amine adjuvant, heat-labile enterotoxin from <i>E. coli </i>(recombinant or otherwise), cholera toxin, or muramyl dipeptide, Freund's Complete and-Incomplete adjuvant, vitamin E, non-ionic block polymers and polyamines such as dextransulphate, carbopol, pyran, saponins and saponin derivatives, block co-polymers, and adjuvants such as those identified in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,578,269, 4,744,983, 5,254,339, which are all herein fully incorporated by reference. Non-limiting examples of peptides that can serve as adjuvants include muramyldipeptides, dimethylglycine, or tuftsin. Non-limiting examples of oils that can serve as adjuvants include mineral oil, vegetable oils or emulsions thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Vaccines made from material cultured according to the present invention may be formulated as an oil-in water emulsions or as a water-in-oil emulsions. Non-limiting examples of oil-in-water emulsions include paraffin oil-in-water emulsions, or emulsions made from one or more of squalene, block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, polysorbate surfactants, and/or threonyl analogs of muramyl dipeptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">Oils used as adjuvants may be metabolizable by the subject receiving the vaccine such as vegetable or animal oils. Such oils typically consist largely of mixtures of triacylglycerols, also known as triglycerides or neutral fats. These nonpolar, water insoluble substances are fatty acid triesters of glycerol. Triacylglycerols differ according to the identity and placement of their three fatty acid residues.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Adjuvants can also be non-metabolizable consisting of components that cannot be metabolized by the body of the animal subject to which the emulsion is administered. Non-metabolizable oils suitable for use in the emulsions of the present invention include alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and their corresponding acids and alcohols, the ethers and esters thereof, and mixtures thereof. The individual compounds of the oil may be light hydrocarbon compounds, e.g., compounds having 6 to 30 carbon atoms. The oil may be synthetically prepared or purified from petroleum products. Non-limiting examples of non-metabolizable oils for use in the preparation of vaccines based upon material cultured according to the present invention include mineral oil, paraffin oil, and cycloparaffins, for example. The term âmineral oilâ refers to a non-metabolizable adjuvant oil that is a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons obtained from petrolatum via a distillation technique. The term is synonymous with âliquefied paraffinâ, âliquid petrolatumâ and âwhite mineral oil.â The term is also intended to include âlight mineral oil,â i.e., oil which is similarly obtained by distillation of petrolatum, but which has a slightly lower specific gravity than white mineral oil.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">Other compounds capable of enhancing a humoral immunity response that may be used in the formulation of vaccines based upon material cultured according to the present invention include, without limitation, ethylene maleic anhydrate (EMA) copolymer, latex emulsions of a copolymer of styrene with a mixture of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">In addition to the adjuvant, a vaccine based upon material cultured according to the present invention can include immunomodulatory agents such as, e.g., interleukins, interferons, or other cytokines (e.g., Th1-related cytokines, such as interleukin-12 (IL-12), interleukin-18 (IL-18), or gamma interferon).</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The amount of adjuvant or immunostimulant added in a vaccine formulation based upon material cultured according to the present invention depends on the nature of the adjuvant or immunostimulant itself. The skilled artisan is capable of selecting an amount that is sufficient to enhance an immune response to the Anaplasmataceae bacterial immunizing agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">Carriers</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers suitable for use in vaccine formulated based upon material cultured according to the present invention may be any conventional liquid carrier suitable for veterinary pharmaceutical compositions, including balanced salt solutions such as are suitable for use in tissue culture media. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are understood to be compounds that do not adversely effect the health of the animal to be vaccinated, at least not to the extent that the adverse effect is worse than the effects seen when the animal is not vaccinated. Suitable carriers also include sterile water, saline, aqueous buffers such as PBS, solvents, diluents, isotonic agents, buffering agents, dextrose, ethanol, mannitol, sorbitol, lactose and glycerol, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">Vehicle</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">Vaccines formulated from material cultured according to the present invention can also comprise a vehicle. A vehicle is a compound to which the host cells, Anaplasmataceae bacterial cells, or proteins, protein fragments, nucleic acids or parts thereof, adhere, without being covalently bound to it. Non-limiting examples of such vehicles include bio-microcapsules, micro-alginates, liposomes and macrosols. Some materials that serve as adjuvants can also serve as vehicles such as aluminum-hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, aluminum sulphate or aluminum oxide, silica, kaolin, and bentonite, all known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">Stabilizers</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">Often, a vaccine is mixed with stabilizers, e.g. to protect degradation-prone components from being degraded, to enhance the shelf-life of the vaccine, or to improve freeze-drying efficiency. Non-limiting examples of stabilizers that may be added to vaccine formulations based upon material cultured according to the present invention include SPGA (Bovarnik et al., 1950, J. Bacteriology, vol. 59, p. 509), skimmed milk, gelatins, bovine serum albumin, carbohydrates (e.g. sorbitol, mannitol, trehalose, starch, sucrose, dextran or glucose), proteins (e.g., albumin, casein or degradation products thereof), non-animal origin stabilizers, and buffers (e.g. alkali metal phosphates). In lyophilized vaccine compositions, one or more stabilizers can be added.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">Multivalent Vaccines</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">The immunogen harvested from the material cultured according to the present invention may be formulated in a vaccine comprising one or more additional immunogens. The additional immunoactive component(s) may be whole parasite, bacteria or virus (inactivated or modified live), or a fractionated portion or extract thereof (e.g., proteins, lipids, lipopolysacharide, carbohydrate or nucleic acid).</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">Where the immunogen harvested from the material cultured according to the present invention is used in a canine vaccine, antigens for other canine pathogens may be added into the formulation. Non-limiting examples of other pathogens for which additional antigens may be added include <i>Bordetella bronchiseptica</i>, canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus types 1 and 2 (CAV-1, CAV-2), canine parainfluenza (CPI) virus, canine coronavirus (CCV), canine parvovirus (CPV), <i>Leptospira interrogans </i>serovar <i>canicola, Leptospira interrogans </i>serovar <i>icterohaemorrhagiae, Leptospira interrogans </i>serovar <i>bratislava, Leptospira interrogans </i>serovar <i>pomona; Leptospira kirschneri </i>serovar <i>grippotyphosa</i>, rabies virus, <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>, canine rotavirus (CRV), canine herpesvirus (CHV), and Minute Virus of Canines (MVC), <i>Babesia canis, Giardia </i>and <i>Leishmania. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">Alternatively, a vaccine based upon material cultured according to the present invention may be administered simultaneously or concomitantly with other live or inactivated vaccines.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Freeze-Drying/Reconstitution</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">For reasons of stability or economy, vaccines based upon material cultured according to the present invention may be freeze-dried. In general this will enable prolonged storage at temperatures above 0Â° C., e.g. at 4Â° C. Procedures for freeze-drying are known to persons skilled in the art; equipment for freeze-drying at different scales is available commercially. To reconstitute the freeze-dried vaccine, it may be suspended in a physiologically acceptable diluent. Such diluents may be as simple as sterile water, or a physiological salt solution or other carrier as discussed above.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">Dosaging</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">Vaccines based upon material cultured according to the present invention may be formulated in a dosage unit form to facilitate administration and ensure uniformity of dosage. Herein, a dosage unit as it pertains to the vaccine composition refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for animals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of Anaplasmataceae bacterial immunogen calculated to produce the desired immunogenic effect in association with the required adjuvant system and carrier or vehicle.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">The effective immunizing amount of Anaplasmataceae bacterial immunogen can vary depending upon the chosen strain or strains and may be any amount sufficient to evoke a protective immune response. For example, amounts wherein the dosage unit comprises at least about 1Ã10<sup>4 </sup>TCID<sub>50 </sub>inactivated Anaplasmataceae bacterin are suitable.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">Administering</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">Administration of the vaccine to a subject results in stimulating an immune response in the subject mammal. The route of administration for vaccines based upon material cultured according to the present invention may be administered to the mammalian target according to methods known in the art. Such methods include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraocular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, oral, oronasal, and subcutaneous, as well as inhalation, suppository, or transdermal. Routes of administration include intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, oronasal, and subcutaneous injection. The vaccine may be administered by any means that includes, but is not limited to, syringes, nebulizers, misters, needleless injection devices, or microprojectile bombardment gene guns (Biolistic bombardment).</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">Alternative routes of application that are feasible are by topical application as a drop, spray, gel or ointment to the mucosal epithelium of the eye, nose, mouth, anus, or vagina, or onto the epidermis of the outer skin at any part of the body; by spray as aerosol, or powder. Alternatively, application may be via the alimentary route, by combining with the food, feed or drinking water e.g. as a powder, a liquid, or tablet, or by administration directly into the mouth as a liquid, a gel, a tablet, or a capsule, or to the anus as a suppository. The preferred application route is by intramuscular or by subcutaneous injection.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">The vaccine according to the invention may be in several forms, e.g.: a liquid, a gel, an ointment, a powder, a tablet, or a capsule, depending on the desired method of application to the target.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">The scheme of the application of the vaccine according to the invention to the target mammalian may be in single or multiple doses, which may be given at the same time or sequentially, in a manner compatible with the dosage and formulation, and in such an amount as will be immunologically effective.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">Challenge Model</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">In order to effectively study and evaluate the pathogenic mechanisms of the Anaplasmataceae bacteria and the defense mechanisms of the host mammals and thereby to advance the vaccine art and improve vaccine products, an effective challenge model should be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">A challenge model for canine ehrlichiosis, for example, may be based upon the percentage of test animals to demonstrate persistent and severe clinical symptoms that are commonly associated with canine ehrlichiosis, such as fever, thrombocytopenia, mucopurulent ocular discharge, dehydration, or the like. Alternatively, the challenge model described by published U.S. Application No. 2006/0188524 (which is herein wholly incorporated by reference) may be employed. This <i>E. canis </i>challenge may be obtained in a test animal by administering to said test animal a challenge stock of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) containing a virulent culture of live <i>E. canis </i>bacteria. The virulent <i>E. canis </i>culture is prepared by repeatedly passaging the <i>E. canis </i>microorganism such as <i>E. canis </i>Ebony, <i>E. canis </i>Broadfoot or the like, in a host; separating the PBMC from the host blood sample; and mixing the separated PBMC with 20% fetal bovine serum and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">A method for the induction of clinical canine ehrlichiosis in a test animal includes administering to said animal an effective amount of an <i>E. canis </i>challenge stock, consisting essentially of a virulent <i>E. canis </i>microorganism in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Viable cultures of each of <i>E. canis </i>Broadfoot (sometimes referred to as <i>E. canis </i>BF, or Broadfoot), and <i>E. canis </i>Ebony (sometimes referred to as Ebony) have been deposited (Feb. 11, 2004) with the ATCC, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209 U.S.A., and have been respectively given the ATCC accession numbers PTA-5811 for the Broadfoot strain, and PTA-5812 for the Ebony strain.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">Several other cellular diagnostic methods exist to determine the presence of infection. For example, the presence of infection may be determined by direct immunofluorescence. Other methods to detect infection include staining, e.g., Giemsa, Wright/Giemsa. Acridine Orange can also be utilized to stain the organisms.</p>
