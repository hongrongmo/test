      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present disclosure relates in part to a water soluble unit dose comprising a liquid, a bittering agent, and a water-soluble film. The invention also relates to a process for making such soluble unit dose.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Detergents today are available in a wide variety of forms such as powders, granules, liquids and gels. Unit dose detergent forms are becoming increasingly popular due to the convenience they offer the consumer on simplified dosing. Such forms are often highly concentrated which offers further sustainability advantages.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">It is known in the art to use bittering substances to reduce the likelihood of accidental ingestion. For example, it is known to coat a unit dose article with BitrexÂ® (denatonium benzoate) to prevent accidental ingestion. It is also known to add bittering agents to such articles by incorporation of the bittering agents either in the film or by spraying, printing, or powdering onto the film.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Adding the bittering agent to the film does, however, add complications. It is a very inefficient means to add the bittering agent as there is inevitable waste associated with the manufacture of unit dose forms; the water-soluble film needs to be held on a roll, and the edges that are cut once the film is loaded with detergent are lost to scrap. There is also exchange over time between the film and the detergent it encases, meaning that the concentration of the bittering agent when added solely in the film drops over time. To compensate for this drop in activity, more bittering agent needs to be added to the film, and more is consequently lost to scrap. Furthermore, during the supply chain, the bittering agent in the film can de-mix from the water-soluble polymer and/or plasticizer and migrate to the surface of the film, thereby making the film harder to seal. This can lead to an increased number of âleakersâ which are highly undesirable as the leaked detergent can contaminate consumers' hands.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">There is a need to provide an efficient means of delivering bittering agents to the film of unit dose articles in a sustainable and economical way.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The present disclosure relates to a unit dose detergent composition comprising at least one compartment, wherein said at least one compartment comprises a liquid composition, wherein said liquid composition comprises plasticizing solvent; a water-soluble film, wherein said water-soluble film comprises a plasticizing agent; and a bittering agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present disclosure further relates to a method of making a unit dose article, comprising the steps of providing a providing a liquid composition comprising a bittering agent and a plasticizing solvent; and contacting a water-soluble film with the liquid composition, wherein the film comprises a plasticizing agent.</p>
    </summary>
    <detailed-desc>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The present disclosure relates to means of delivering bittering agents to the film by virtue of either: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>(a) adding bittering agents to the detergent and inducing it to migrate to the surface of the film through choice of an appropriate liquid detergent and an appropriate film; or</li><li>(b) adding the bittering agent to the outside of the film after the unit dose has been filled with detergent and sealed by means of spraying or atomizing a solution comprising a film plasticizer and said bittering agent, wherein said plasticizer is a plasticizer other than water.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0011">Both these approaches solve the technical problem of delivering enough bittering agent to the film to be bitter to the taste but achieve this effect without negatively impacting film stability and sealing profile. When applying the bittering agent, it is highly desired to use a plasticizer other than water as too high a water content on outside of the film can give rise to âsticky pouchesâ (pouches that stick together and that are hard to pull apart without rupturing the contents).</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0012">Liquid compositions, and the agents dissolved therein, in contact with water-soluble films can travel into and through the films. This phenomenon is known as migration or âweeping.â This is generally seen as an undesirable phenomenon, and a manufacturer may take steps to mitigate such migration or weeping. See, for example, EP Patent Application 12195792.2, assigned to The Procter &amp; Gamble Company. However, the present disclosure inventively leverages this issue into an advantage for the manufacturer. In effect, plasticizing solvents and/or films may be selected to induce the migration of a bittering agent from a liquid composition into or through a film, thereby providing a unit dose article or a film that comprises the bittering agent within or on the exterior of the film.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DEFINITIONS</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0013">Features and benefits of the various embodiments of the present invention will become apparent from the following description, which includes examples of specific embodiments intended to give a broad representation of the invention.

      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0018">In this description, all concentrations and ratios are on a weight basis of the composition unless otherwise specified.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="2">Form</heading>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0019">In some aspects, the present invention is directed to a water soluble unit dose article. The unit dose article comprises at least one compartment, wherein the compartment comprises a composition. A unit dose article is intended to provide a single, easy to use dose of the composition contained within the article for a particular application.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0020">The compartment should be understood as meaning a closed internal space within the unit dose article, which holds the composition. Preferably, the unit dose article comprises a water-soluble film. The unit dose article is manufactured such that the water-soluble film completely surrounds the composition and in doing so defines the compartment in which the composition resides. The unit dose article may comprise two films. A first film may be shaped to comprise an open compartment into which the composition is added. A second film is then laid over the first film in such an orientation as to close the opening of the compartment. The first and second films are then sealed together along a seal region. The seal region may comprise a flange. The flange is comprised of excess sealed film material that protrudes beyond the edge of the unit dose article and provides increased surface area for seal of the first and second films. The film is described in more detail below. In some aspects, the unit dose article comprises three films.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0021">The unit dose article may comprise more than one compartment, even at least two compartments, or even at least three compartments. The compartments may be arranged in superposed orientation, i.e., one positioned on top of the other, where they may share a common wall. In one aspect, at least one compartment is superposed on another compartment. Alternatively, the compartments may be positioned in a side-by-side orientation, i.e., one orientated next to the other. The compartments may even be orientated in a âtire and rimâ arrangement, i.e., a first compartment is positioned next to a second compartment, but the first compartment at least partially surrounds the second compartment, but does not completely enclose the second compartment. Alternatively, one compartment may be completely enclosed within another compartment.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0022">When the unit dose article comprises at least two compartments, one of the compartments may be smaller than the other compartment. When the unit dose article comprises at least three compartments, two of the compartments may be smaller than the third compartment, and preferably the smaller compartments are superposed on the larger compartment. The smaller superposed compartments preferably are orientated side-by-side.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0023">When the unit dose article comprises at least two compartments, each compartment may comprise identical compositions, or each compartment may independently comprise a different composition. The compartments may be sensorially different; for example, the compartments may have different shapes, or they may be different colors.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0024">The composition may be any suitable composition. The composition may be in the form of a solid, a liquid, a dispersion, a gel, a paste, or a mixture thereof. The compositions in each compartment of a multicompartment unit dose article may be different. However, typically at least one compartment of the unit dose article, preferably each compartment, comprises a liquid. The composition is described in more detail below.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">Water-Soluble or Water-Dispersible Film</heading>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0025">The film of the present invention is soluble or dispersible in water. The water-soluble film preferably has a thickness of from about 20 to about 150 microns, preferably about 35 to about 125 microns, even more preferably about 50 to about 110 microns, most preferably about 76 microns.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0026">Preferably, the film has a water-solubility of at least 50%, preferably at least 75% or even at least 95%, as measured by the method set out here after using a glass-filter with a maximum pore size of 20 microns:</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0027">50 gramsÂ±0.1 gram of film material is added in a pre-weighed 400 ml beaker and 245 mlÂ±1 ml of distilled water is added. This is stirred vigorously on a magnetic stirrer, labline model No. 1250 or equivalent and 5 cm magnetic stirrer, set at 600 rpm, for 30 minutes at 24Â° C. Then, the mixture is filtered through a folded qualitative sintered-glass filter with a pore size as defined above (max. 20 micron). The water is dried off from the collected filtrate by any conventional method, and the weight of the remaining material is determined (which is the dissolved or dispersed fraction). Then, the percentage solubility or dispersability can be calculated.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0028">Preferred film materials are preferably polymeric materials. The film material can, for example, be obtained by casting, blow-moulding, extrusion, or blown extrusion of the polymeric material, as known in the art. Preferably the film is obtained by an extrusion process or by a casting process.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0029">Preferred polymers (including copolymers, terpolymers, or derivatives thereof) suitable for use as film material are selected from polyvinyl alcohols (PVA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyalkylene oxides, acrylamide, acrylic acid, cellulose, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, cellulose amides, polyvinyl acetates, polycarboxylic acids and salts, polyaminoacids or peptides, polyamides, polyacrylamide, copolymers of maleic/acrylic acids, polysaccharides including starch and gelatine, natural gums such as xanthum and carragum. More preferred polymers are selected from polyacrylates and water-soluble acrylate copolymers, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, dextrin, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, maltodextrin, polymethacrylates, and most preferably selected from polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl alcohol copolymers and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), and combinations thereof. Preferably, the polymers of the film material are free of carboxylate groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0030">Preferably, the level of polymer in the film material, for example a PVA polymer, is at least 60%. The polymer can have any weight average molecular weight, preferably from about 1000 to 1,000,000, more preferably from about 10,000 to 300,000, yet more preferably from about 20,000 to 150,000.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0031">Mixtures of polymers can also be used as the film material. This can be beneficial to control the mechanical and/or dissolution properties of the compartments or pouch, depending on the application thereof and the required needs. Suitable mixtures include for example mixtures wherein one polymer has a higher water-solubility than another polymer, and/or one polymer has a higher mechanical strength than another polymer. Also suitable are mixtures of polymers having different weight average molecular weights, for example a mixture of PVA or a copolymer thereof of a weight average molecular weight of about 10,000 to about 40,000, preferably about 20,000, and of PVA or copolymer thereof, with a weight average molecular weight of about 100,000 to about 300,000, preferably about 150,000. Also suitable herein are polymer blend compositions, for example comprising hydrolytically degradable and water-soluble polymer blends such as polylactide and polyvinyl alcohol, obtained by mixing polylactide and polyvinyl alcohol, typically comprising about 1-35% by weight polylactide and about 65% to 99% by weight polyvinyl alcohol. Preferred for use herein are polymers, preferably polyvinyl alcohol, which are from about 60% to about 99% hydrolysed, preferably from about 80% to about 99% hydrolysed, even more preferably from about 80% to about 90% hydrolysed, to improve the dissolution characteristics of the material.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0032">Preferred films exhibit good dissolution in cold water, meaning unheated distilled water. Preferably such films exhibit good dissolution at temperatures 24Â° C., even more preferably at 10Â° C. By good dissolution it is meant that the film exhibits water-solubility of at least 50%, preferably at least 75% or even at least 95%, as measured, by the method set out here after using a glass-filter with a maximum pore size of 20 microns, described above. Water-solubility may be determined at 24Â° C., or preferably at 10Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0033">Preferred films are those supplied by Monosol (Merrillville, Ind., USA) under the trade references M8630, M8900, M8779, and M8310 films described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,166,117 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,787,512, and PVA films of corresponding solubility and deformability characteristics. Other suitable films may include called SolublonÂ® PT, SolublonÂ® GA, SolublonÂ® KC or SolublonÂ® KL from the Aicello Chemical Europe GmbH, the films VF-HP by Kuraray, or the films by Nippon Gohsei, such as Hi Selon. Further preferred films are those described in US2006/0213801, US2011/0188784, WO2010/119022, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,787,512. In some aspects, the film is selected so that the migration of the bittering agent from the liquid to the film occurs at a greater rate than the migration of the bittering agent to M8630 film under otherwise identical conditions. In some aspects, it is preferable to use a film that exhibits better dissolution than M8630 film, supplied by Monosol, at temperatures 24Â° C., even more preferably at 10Â° C. Migration and/or presence of the bittering agent on the surface of the film may be determined according to the methods below.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0034">Preferred water soluble films are those derived from a resin that comprises a blend of polymers, preferably wherein at least one polymer in the blend is polyvinyl alcohol. Preferably, the water soluble film resin comprises a blend of PVA polymers. For example, the PVA resin can include at least two PVA polymers, wherein as used herein the first PVA polymer has a viscosity less than the second PVA polymer. A first PVA polymer can have a viscosity of at least 8 centipoise (cP), 10 cP, 12 cP, or 13 cP and at most 40 cP, 20 cP, 15 cP, or 13 cP, for example in a range of about 8 cP to about 40 cP, or 10 cP to about 20 cP, or about 10 cP to about 15 cP, or about 12 cP to about 14 cP, or 13 cP. Furthermore, a second PVA polymer can have a viscosity of at least about 10 cP, 20 cP, or 22 cP and at most about 40 cP, 30 cP, 25 cP, or 24 cP, for example in a range of about 10 cP to about 40 cP, or 20 to about 30 cP, or about 20 to about 25 cP, or about 22 to about 24, or about 23 cP. The viscosity of a PVA polymer is determined by measuring a freshly made solution using a Brookfield LV type viscometer with UL adapter as described in British Standard EN ISO 15023-2:2006 Annex E Brookfield Test method. It is international practice to state the viscosity of 4% aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solutions at 20Â° C. All viscosities specified herein in cP should be understood to refer to the viscosity of 4% aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution at 20Â° C., unless specified otherwise. Similarly, when a resin is described as having (or not having) a particular viscosity, unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the specified viscosity is the average viscosity for the resin, which inherently has a corresponding molecular weight distribution.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0035">The individual PVA polymers can have any suitable degree of hydrolysis, as long as the degree of hydrolysis of the PVA resin is within the ranges described herein. Optionally, the PVA resin can, in addition or in the alternative, include a first PVA polymer that has a Mw in a range of about 50,000 to about 300,000 Daltons, or about 60,000 to about 150,000 Daltons; and a second PVA polymer that has a Mw in a range of about 60,000 to about 300,000 Daltons, or about 80,000 to about 250,000 Daltons.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0036">Different film material and/or films of different thickness may be employed in making the compartments of the present invention. A benefit in selecting different films is that the resulting compartments may exhibit different solubility or release characteristics.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0037">The film material herein can also comprise one or more additive ingredients. For example, the film preferably comprises a plasticizing agent. The plasticizing agent may comprise water, glycerol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, or mixtures thereof. In some aspects, the film comprises from about 2% to about 35%, or from about 5% to about 25%, by weight of the film, a plasticizing agent selected from group comprising water, glycerol, diethylene glycol, sorbitol, and mixtures thereof. In some aspects, the film material comprises at least two, or preferably at least three, plasticizing agents. In some aspects, the film is substantially free of ethanol, meaning that the film comprises from 0% (including 0%) to about 0.1% ethanol by weight of the film. In some aspects, the plasticizing agents are the same as the plasticizing solvents in the liquid composition, described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0038">Other additives may include water and functional detergent additives, including surfactant, to be delivered to the wash water, for example, organic polymeric dispersants, etc.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">Bittering Agent</heading>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0039">The unit dose article comprises a bittering agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0040">The bittering agent is preferably a denatonium salt or a derivative thereof. In one aspect, the bittering agent is a denatonium salt selected from the group consisting of denatonium chloride, denatonium citrate, denatonium saccharide, denatonium carbonate, denatonium acetate, denatonium benzoate, and mixtures thereof. In one aspect, the liquid composition comprises a first denatonium salt and the film comprises a second denatonium salt that is different than the first denatonium salt.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0041">A particularly preferred bittering agent is denatonium benzoate, also known as phenylmethyl-[2-[(2,6-dimethylphenyl)amino]-2-oxoethyl]-diethylammonium benzoate, CAS no. 3734-33-6. Denatonium benzoate is commercially sold as BITREXÂ®, available from Macfarlan Smith, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0042">In some aspects, the bittering agent is a natural bitter substance. In some aspects, the bittering agent has a bitter value of from about 1000 to about 200000. In some aspects, the bittering agent is a natural bitter substance with a bitter value of from about 1000 to about 200000, where the natural bitter substance is selected from the group consisting of glycosides, isoprenoids, alkaloids, amino acids, and mixtures thereof. For example, suitable bittering agents also include Quercetin (3,3â²,4â²,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone); Naringin (4â²,5,7-Trihydroxyflavanone-7-rhamnoglucoside); Aucubin; Amarogentin; Dihydrofoliamentin; Gentiopicroside; Gentiopicrin; Swertiamarin; Swerosid; Gentioflavosid; Centaurosid; Methiafolin; Harpagoside; Centapikrin; Sailicin; Kondurangin; Absinthin; Artabsin; Cnicin; Lactucin; Lactucopicrin; Salonitenolid; Î±-thujone; Î²-thujone; Desoxy Limonene; Limonin; Ichangin; iso-Obacunoic Acid; Obacunone; Obacunoic Acid; Nomilin; Ichangin; Nomilinoic acid; Marrubin; Pramarrubin; Carnosol; Carnosic acid; Quassin; Quinine hydrochloride; Quinine sulfate; Quinine dihydrochloride; Columbine; Caffeine; Threonine; Methionine; Phenylalanine; Tryptophan; Arginine; Histidine; Valine; Aspartic acid; Sucrose octaacetate; and mixtures thereof. Other suitable bittering agents include quinine bisulfate and hop extract (e.g., humulone).</p>

In some aspects, the unit dose article comprises a bittering agent in a sufficient amount to provide a bitter taste.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0044">Typically, the bittering agent is not initially present in the film but migrates into the film and to the surface of the film after storage.

When the bittering agent is sprayed or atomized onto a film, the sprayed or atomized composition may be non-aqueous, meaning that it comprises less than 20%, or less than 15%, or less than 10%, or less than 5%, or less than 1% water by weight of the sprayed or atomized composition. The sprayed or atomized composition may even comprise zero percent water. Additionally, the sprayed or atomized composition may comprises from about 0.001% to about 40%, or from about 0.1% to about 35%, or from about 5% to about 30%, by weight of the sprayed or atomized composition, bittering agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0046">In some aspects, the concentration of the bittering agent on the surface of the film is from about 10 ppb to about 10,000 ppm, or preferably from about 50 ppb to about 200 ppm, or more preferably from about 10 ppm to about 250 ppm. In some aspects, the concentration of the bittering agent is determined after storage of the unit dose article for one month at 25Â° C. and 60% relative humidity.</p>

The unit dose composition typically comprises at least one compartment, wherein the at least one compartment comprises the liquid composition. In some aspects, the film encapsulates the liquid composition. The liquid composition preferably comprises the bittering agent. Where the unit dose comprises multiple liquid compartments, the bittering agent may be added to or present in one, two, or even all the compartments.</p>

      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0048">The liquid composition further comprises a plasticizing solvent. The liquid composition may comprise from about 10% to about 50%, or from about 15% to about 40%, by weight of the liquid composition, of the plasticizing solvent.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0049">When the liquid composition comprises both a bittering agent and a plasticizing solvent, the plasticizing solvent is preferably selected to induce the bittering agent to migrate from the liquid composition to the water-soluble film. The liquid composition may consist essentially of the bittering agent and the plasticizing solvent, or the liquid composition may comprise other adjuncts, which are described in more detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0050">The plasticizing solvent in the present compositions can be a plasticizing solvent containing water, organic solvent, or mixtures thereof. Suitable organic solvents include low molecular weight alcohols and/or low molecular weight glycols, wherein âlow molecular weightâ in this context means having a molecular weight of less than about 500. Suitable organic solvents preferably include glycerol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, dipropylene glycol, diethylene glycol, sorbitol, and mixtures thereof. In some aspects, the plasticizing solvent comprises water, glycerol, 1,2-propanediol, 1-3-propanediol, dipropylene glycol, diethylene glycol, sorbitol, or mixtures thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0051">In some aspects, the plasticizing solvent comprises at least one primary solvent, preferably an organic solvent, having Hansen solubility (Î´) of greater than 29, more preferably greater than 30, and preferably less than 40. For reference, the Hansen solubility for water is approximately 42. The units used are MPa<sup>0.5</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0052">Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that solvents with relatively higher Hansen solubility values tend to migrate through water soluble film at greater rates and levels than solvents with relatively lower Hansen solubility values. Such solvents, then, induce migration of components from the liquid into and through the film. As a unit dose manufacturer generally seeks to minimize migration through film, it is thus counter-intuitive to select a solvent with relatively high Hansen solubility, for example, greater than 29.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0053">The Hansen solubility parameter is a well known and calculated parameter based on a three component measuring system. The Hansen solubility parameter is based on a dispersion force component (Î´<sub>d</sub>), a hydrogen bonding component (Î´<sub>h</sub>), and a polar component (Î´<sub>p</sub>). The Hansen solubility parameter (Î´) is derived from the fact that the total cohesive energy, which is the energy required to break all the cohesive bonds, is the combination of the dispersion forces (d), the molecular dipole forces (p) and the hydrogen bonding forces (h) according to the following equation:</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]Î´<sup>2</sup>=Î´<sub>d</sub><sup>2</sup>âÎ´<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>+Î´<sub>h</sub><sup>2 </sup>[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0054">The Hansen solubility (Î´) is calculated by finding the square root of Î´<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0055">Dispersion forces are weak attractive forces between non-polar molecules. The magnitude of these forces depends on the polarizability of the molecule, and the dispersion force component (Î´<sub>d</sub>) typically increases with increasing volume (and size) of the molecule, all other properties being roughly equal. Hansen solubility parameters are calculated at 25Â° C., with ChemSW's molecular modeling Pro v6.1.9 software package which uses an unpublished proprietary algorithm that is based on values published in the Handbook of solubility Parameters and other parameters by Allan F M Barton (CRC Press 1983) for solvents obtained experimentally by Hansen.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0056">The primary solvent preferably has a cLog P of less than â1.0 and more preferably less than â1.5. The primary solvent preferably has a Hydrogen bonding component (Î´<sub>h</sub>) of greater than 20.5, more preferably greater than 23, and preferably less than 40.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0057">The primary solvent is preferably selected from the group consisting of propanediol, glycerol, sorbitol, and mixtures thereof.</p>

A unit dose article comprising film may be provided, where the unit dose article did not initially have a bittering agent on the exterior of the film. The amount of weeping (i.e., liquids traveling through the film) can be quantified according to the method below. The presence of the bittering agent can also be determined according to the method below. As the bittering agent migrates with the liquid through the film, it follows that more weeping indicates more migration of the bittering agent. As described above, careful selection of plasticizing solvents and/or films can lead to increased migration of the bittering agent.</p>
      <heading id="h-00015-en" level="2">Method for Measuring Weeping</heading>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">Migration of liquid compounds through the film to the outside of the water soluble package can be quantified using a Corneometer CM825 equipped with CM-825 probe, manufactured by Courage-Khazaka Electronic, Koln, Germany. The equipment is calibrated according to the supplier recommendation. The equipment provides a corneometer value which is recorded. The Corneometer can detect even slightest changes in weeping level since change in the dielectric constant (i.e. presence of fluid on the outside of the pouch) alters the Corneometer value.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">The equipment is placed in a conditioned laboratory at 20Â° C.+/â3 C and 50%+/â10 relative humidity. The pouches are brought to temperature of 20+/â3 C prior to the measurement. The probe is cleaned with a dry and clean paper tissue; then blank measurements are made by slowly wiping the sensor on the clean paper tissue (VWR International bvba, Leuven, Belgium, Cat. No. 115-0600), to ensure there is no contamination on the probe, until the instrument reads a Corneometer value of zero. The probe is placed vertically on the pouch, as per the usage instructions. Ten replicates are measured for each pouch. The center and corners of the top and bottom face of the pouch are tested. Measurement are repeated on 5 different pouches. The data is thus the average of 50 measurements. The probe is cleaned in between each measurement.</p>
