      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/701,972, filed on Sep. 17, 2012, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety.</p>

      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Oral delivery is typically a desired route of administration because it is more convenient and involves less patient discomfort as compared to injection, nasal administration and other administration routes. Oral administration of peptides, however, is generally difficult because peptides are susceptible to degradation. Oral administration of short peptides like angiotensins tends to be even more problematic because short peptides typically lack secondary or tertiary structures and therefore are more susceptible to proteolytic enzymes of both the stomach and intestines. These enzymes can quickly degrade a short peptide, rendering it inactive before it can be absorbed into the bloodstream.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0033">In order for the present invention to be more readily understood, certain terms are first defined below. Additional definitions for the following terms and other terms are set forth throughout the specification.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0034">Animal: As used herein, the term âanimalâ refers to any member of the animal kingdom. In some embodiments, âanimalâ refers to humans, at any stage of development. In some embodiments, âanimalâ refers to non-human animals, at any stage of development. In certain embodiments, the non-human animal is a mammal (e.g., a rodent, a mouse, a rat, a rabbit, a monkey, a dog, a cat, a sheep, cattle, a primate, and/or a pig). In some embodiments, animals include, but are not limited to, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, insects, and/or worms. In some embodiments, an animal may be a transgenic animal, genetically-engineered animal, and/or a clone.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0035">Approximately or about: As used herein, the term âapproximatelyâ or âabout,â as applied to one or more values of interest, refers to a value that is similar to a stated reference value. In certain embodiments, the term âapproximatelyâ or âaboutâ refers to a range of values that fall within 25%, 20%, 19%, 18%, 17%, 16%, 15%, 14%, 13%, 12%, 11%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, or less in either direction (greater than or less than) of the stated reference value unless otherwise stated or otherwise evident from the context (except where such number would exceed 100% of a possible value).</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0036">Bioavailability: As used herein, the term âbioavailabilityâ generally refers to the percentage of the administered dose that reaches the blood stream of a subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0037">Biologically active: As used herein, the phrase âbiologically activeâ refers to a characteristic of any agent that has activity in a biological system, and particularly in an organism. For instance, an agent that, when administered to an organism, has a biological effect on that organism, is considered to be biologically active. In particular embodiments, where a peptide is biologically active, a portion of that peptide that shares at least one biological activity of the peptide is typically referred to as a âbiologically activeâ portion. In certain embodiments, a peptide has no intrinsic biological activity but that inhibits the effects of one or more naturally-occurring angiotensin compounds is considered to be biologically active.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0038">Carrier or diluent: As used herein, the terms âcarrierâ and âdiluentâ refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable (e.g., safe and non-toxic for administration to a human) carrier or diluting substance useful for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation. Exemplary diluents include sterile water, bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), a pH buffered solution (e.g. phosphate-buffered saline), sterile saline solution, Ringer's solution or dextrose solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0039">Dosage form: As used herein, the terms âdosage formâ and âunit dosage formâ refer to a physically discrete unit of a therapeutic agent for the patient to be treated. Each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect. It will be understood, however, that the total dosage of the composition will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0040">Dosing regimen: A âdosing regimenâ (or âtherapeutic regimenâ), as that term is used herein, is a set of unit doses (typically more than one) that are administered individually to a subject, typically separated by periods of time. In some embodiments, a given therapeutic agent has a recommended dosing regimen, which may involve one or more doses. In some embodiments, a dosing regimen comprises a plurality of doses each of which are separated from one another by a time period of the same length; in some embodiments, a dosing regime comprises a plurality of doses and at least two different time periods separating individual doses. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is administered continuously over a predetermined period. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is administered once a day (QD) or twice a day (BID).</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0041">Excipient: As used herein, the term âexcipientâ refers to any inert substance added to a drug and/or formulation for the purposes of improving its physical qualities (i.e. consistency), pharmacokinetic properties (i.e. bioavailability), pharmacodynamic properties and combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0042">Functional equivalent or functional derivative: As used herein, the term âfunctional equivalentâ or âfunctional derivativeâ denotes, in the context of a functional derivative of an amino acid sequence, a molecule that retains a biological activity that is substantially similar to that of the original sequence. A functional derivative or equivalent may be a natural derivative or is prepared recombinantly or synthetically. Exemplary functional derivatives include amino acid sequences having substitutions, deletions, or additions of one or more amino acids, provided that the biological activity of the protein is conserved. The substituting amino acid desirably has chemico-physical properties which are similar to that of the substituted amino acid. Desirable similar chemico-physical properties include, similarities in charge, bulkiness, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0043">Improve, increase, or reduce: As used herein, the terms âimprove,â âincreaseâ or âreduce,â or grammatical equivalents, indicate values that are relative to a baseline measurement, such as a measurement in the same individual prior to initiation of the treatment described herein, or a measurement in a control individual (or multiple control individuals) in the absence of the treatment described herein. A âcontrol individualâ is an individual afflicted with the same form of disease as the individual being treated, who is about the same age as the individual being treated (to ensure that the stages of the disease in the treated individual and the control individual(s) are comparable).</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0044">In vitro: As used herein, the term âin vitroâ refers to events that occur in an artificial environment, e.g., in a test tube or reaction vessel, in cell culture, etc., rather than within a multi-cellular organism.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0045">In vivo: As used herein, the term âin vivoâ refers to events that occur within a multi-cellular organism, such as a human and a non-human animal. In the context of cell-based systems, the term may be used to refer to events that occur within a living cell (as opposed to, for example, in vitro systems).</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0046">Isolated: As used herein, the term âisolatedâ refers to a substance and/or entity that has been (1) separated from at least some of the components with which it was associated when initially produced (whether in nature and/or in an experimental setting), and/or (2) produced, prepared, and/or manufactured by the hand of man. Isolated substances and/or entities may be separated from at least about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95%, about 98%, about 99%, substantially 100%, or 100% of the other components with which they were initially associated. In some embodiments, isolated agents are more than about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, substantially 100%, or 100% pure. As used herein, a substance is âpureâ if it is substantially free of other components. As used herein, the term âisolated cellâ refers to a cell not contained in a multi-cellular organism.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0047">Peptide: The term âpeptideâ as used herein refers a sequential chain of amino acids linked together via peptide bonds. Typically, the term is used to refer to an amino acid chain of short length, but one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the term is not limited to any particular length chains and can refer to a minimal chain comprising two amino acids linked together via a peptide bond. Typically, however, a peptide refers to an amino acid chain of or less than 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10 amino acids. As is known to those skilled in the art, peptides may be processed and/or modified.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0048">Pharmaceutically acceptable: As used herein, the term âpharmaceutically-acceptableâ refers to any entity or composition that does not produce an undesirable allergic or antigenic response when administered to a subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0049">Protein: The term âproteinâ as used herein refers to one or more polypeptides that function as a discrete unit. If a single polypeptide is the discrete functioning unit and does not require permanent or temporary physical association with other polypeptides in order to form the discrete functioning unit, the terms âpolypeptideâ and âproteinâ may be used interchangeably. If the discrete functional unit is comprised of more than one polypeptide that physically associate with one another, the term âproteinâ refers to the multiple polypeptides that are physically coupled and function together as the discrete unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0050">Stability: As used herein, the term âstableâ refers to the ability of the therapeutic agent to maintain its therapeutic efficacy (e.g., all or the majority of its intended biological activity and/or physiochemical integrity) over extended periods of time. The stability of a therapeutic agent, and the capability of the pharmaceutical composition to maintain stability of such therapeutic agent, may be assessed over extended periods of time (e.g., for at least 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 months or more). In certain embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions described herein have been formulated such that they are capable of stabilizing, or alternatively slowing or preventing the degradation, of one or more therapeutic agents formulated therewith. In the context of a formulation a stable formulation is one in which the therapeutic agent therein essentially retains its physical and/or chemical integrity and biological activity upon storage and during processes (such as freeze/thaw, mechanical mixing and lyophilization).</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0051">Subject: As used herein, the term âsubjectâ refers to a human or any non-human animal (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, cattle, swine, sheep, horse or primate). A human includes pre and post natal forms. In many embodiments, a subject is a human being. A subject can be a patient, which refers to a human presenting to a medical provider for diagnosis or treatment of a disease. The term âsubjectâ is used herein interchangeably with âindividualâ or âpatient.â A subject can be afflicted with or is susceptible to a disease or disorder but may or may not display symptoms of the disease or disorder.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0052">Substantially: As used herein, the term âsubstantiallyâ refers to the qualitative condition of exhibiting total or near-total extent or degree of a characteristic or property of interest. One of ordinary skill in the biological arts will understand that biological and chemical phenomena rarely, if ever, go to completion and/or proceed to completeness or achieve or avoid an absolute result. The term âsubstantiallyâ is therefore used herein to capture the potential lack of completeness inherent in many biological and chemical phenomena.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0053">Therapeutically effective amount: As used herein, the term âtherapeutically effective amountâ of a therapeutic agent means an amount that is sufficient, when administered to a subject suffering from or susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition, to treat, diagnose, prevent, and/or delay the onset of the symptom(s) of the disease, disorder, and/or condition. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that a therapeutically effective amount is typically administered via a dosing regimen comprising at least one unit dose.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0054">Treating: As used herein, the term âtreat,â âtreatment,â or âtreatingâ refers to any method used to partially or completely alleviate, ameliorate, relieve, inhibit, prevent, delay onset of, reduce severity of and/or reduce incidence of one or more symptoms or features of a particular disease, disorder, and/or condition.

      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0063">Different types of angiotensin may be formed by the action of various enzymes. For example, Angiotensin (1-7) is generated by action of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2).</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0064">Ang-(1-7) is an endogenous ligand for Mas receptors. Mas receptors are G-protein coupled receptor containing seven transmembrane spanning regions. As used herein, the term âangiotensin-(1-7) receptorâ² encompasses the G Protein-Coupled Mas Receptors.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0065">As used herein, the term ânaturally-occurring Angiotensin (1-7)â includes any Angiotensin (1-7) peptide purified from natural sources and any recombinantly produced or chemically synthesized peptides that have an amino acid sequence identical to that of the naturally-occurring Angiotensin (1-7).</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0066">Functional Equivalents, Analogs or Derivatives of Ang-(I-7)</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0067">In some embodiments, an angiotensin (1-7) peptide suitable for the present invention is a functional equivalent of naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7). As used herein, a functional equivalent of naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7) refers to any peptide that shares amino acid sequence identity to the naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7) and retain substantially the same or similar activity as the naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7). For example, in some embodiments, a functional equivalent of naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7) described herein has pro-angiogenic activity as determined using methods described herein or known in the art, or an activity such as nitric oxide release, vasodilation, improved endothelial function, antidiuresis, or one of the other properties discussed herein, that positively impacts angiogenesis. In some embodiments, a functional equivalent of naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7) described herein can bind to or activate an angiotensin-(1-7) receptor (e.g., the G protein-coupled Mas receptor) as determined using various assays described herein or known in the art. In some embodiments, a functional equivalent of Ang-(1-7) is also referred to as an angiotensin (1-7) analogue or derivative, or functional derivative.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0068">Typically, a functional equivalent of angiotensin (1-7) shares amino acid sequence similarity to the naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7). In some embodiments, a functional equivalent of Ang-(1-7) according to the invention contains a sequence that includes at least 3 (e.g., at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7) amino acids from the seven amino acids that appear in the naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7), wherein the at least 3 (e.g., at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, or at least 7) amino acids maintain their relative positions and/or spacing as they appear in the naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7).</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0069">In some embodiments, a functional equivalent of Ang-(1-7) also encompass any peptide that contain a sequence at least 50% (e.g., at least 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90%) identical to the amino acid sequence of naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7). Percentage of amino acid sequence identity can be determined by alignment of amino acid sequences. Alignment of amino acid sequences can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. Preferably, the WU-BLAST-2 software is used to determine amino acid sequence identity (Altschul et al., <i>Methods in Enzymology </i>266, 460-480 (1996); http://blast.wustl/edu/blast/README.html). WU-BLAST-2 uses several search parameters, most of which are set to the default values. The adjustable parameters are set with the following values: overlap span=1, overlap fraction=0.125, word threshold (T)=11. HSP score (S) and HSP S2 parameters are dynamic values and are established by the program itself, depending upon the composition of the particular sequence, however, the minimum values may be adjusted and are set as indicated above.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0070">In some embodiments, a functional equivalent, analogue or derivative of Ang-(1-7) is a fragment of the naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7). In some embodiments, a functional equivalent, analogue or derivative of Ang-(1-7) contains amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions in the naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7). Ang-(1-7) functional equivalents, analogues or derivatives can be made by altering the amino acid sequences by substitutions, additions, and/or deletions. For example, one or more amino acid residues within the sequence of the naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7) (SEQ ID NO:1) can be substituted by another amino acid of a similar polarity, which acts as a functional equivalent, resulting in a silent alteration. Substitution for an amino acid within the sequence may be selected from other members of the class to which the amino acid belongs. For example, the positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine, and histidine. The nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids include leucine, isoleucine, alanine, phenylalanine, valine, proline, tryptophane, and methionine. The uncharged polar amino acids include serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine. The negatively charged (acid) amino acids include glutamic acid and aspartic acid. The amino acid glycine may be included in either the nonpolar amino acid family or the uncharged (neutral) polar amino acid family. Substitutions made within a family of amino acids are generally understood to be conservative substitutions. For example, the amino acid sequence of a peptide inhibitor can be modified or substituted.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0071">Examples of Ang-(1-7) functional equivalents, analogues and derivatives are described in the section entitled âExemplary Angiotensin(1-7) Peptidesâ below.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0072">An angiotensin-(1-7) peptide can be of any length. In some embodiments, an angiotensin-(1-7) peptide according to the present invention can contain, for example, from 4-25 amino acids (e.g., 4-20, 4-15, 4-14, 4-13, 4-12, 4-11, 4-10, 4-9, 4-8, 4-7 amino acids). In some embodiments, the linear peptide contains 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25 amino acids.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0073">In some embodiments, an angiotensin-(1-7) peptide contains one or more modifications to increase protease resistance, serum stability and/or bioavailability. In some embodiments, suitable modifications are selected from pegylation, acetylation, glycosylation, biotinylation, substitution with D-amino acid and/or un-natural amino acid, and/or cyclization of the peptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0074">As used herein, the term âamino acid,â in its broadest sense, refers to any compound and/or substance that can be incorporated into a polypeptide chain. In certain embodiments, an amino acid has the general structure H<sub>2</sub>NâC(H)(R)âCOOH. In certain embodiments, an amino acid is a naturally-occurring amino acid. In certain embodiments, an amino acid is a synthetic or un-natural amino acid (e.g., Î±,Î±-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids); in some embodiments, an amino acid is a d-amino acid; in certain embodiments, an amino acid is an 1-amino acid. âStandard amino acidâ refers to any of the twenty standard amino acids commonly found in naturally occurring peptides including both 1- and d-amino acids which are both incorporated in peptides in nature. âNonstandardâ or âunconventional amino acidâ refers to any amino acid, other than the standard amino acids, regardless of whether it is prepared synthetically or obtained from a natural source. As used herein, âsynthetic or un-natural amino acidâ encompasses chemically modified amino acids, including but not limited to salts, amino acid derivatives (such as amides), and/or substitutions. Amino acids, including carboxy- and/or amino-terminal amino acids in peptides, can be modified by methylation, amidation, acetylation, and/or substitution with other chemical groups that can change the peptide's circulating half-life without adversely affecting its activity. Examples of unconventional or un-natural amino acids include, but are not limited to, citrulline, ornithine, norleucine, norvaline, 4-(E)-butenyl-4(R)-methyl-N-methylthreonine (MeBmt), N-methyl-leucine (MeLeu), aminoisobutyric acid, statine, and N-methyl-alanine (MeAla). Amino acids may participate in a disulfide bond. The term âamino acidâ is used interchangeably with âamino acid residue,â and may refer to a free amino acid and/or to an amino acid residue of a peptide. It will be apparent from the context in which the term is used whether it refers to a free amino acid or a residue of a peptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0075">In certain embodiments, angiotensin-(1-7) peptides contain one or more L-amino acids, D-amino acids, and/or un-natural amino acids.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0076">In addition to peptides containing only naturally occurring amino acids, peptidomimetics or peptide analogs are also encompassed by the present invention. Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. The non-peptide compounds are termed âpeptide mimeticsâ or peptidomimetics (Fauchere et al., <i>Infect. Immun. </i>54:283-287 (1986); Evans et al., J. Med. Chem. 30:1229-1239 (1987)). Peptide mimetics that are structurally related to therapeutically useful peptides and may be used to produce an equivalent or enhanced therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to the paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biological or pharmacological activity) such as naturally-occurring receptor-binding polypeptides, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by linkages such as âCH<sub>2</sub>NHâ, âCH<sub>2</sub>Sâ, âCH<sub>2</sub>âCH<sub>2</sub>â, âCHâCHâ (cis and trans), âCH<sub>2</sub>SOâ, âCH(OH)CH<sub>2</sub>â, âCOCH<sub>2</sub>â etc., by methods well known in the art (Spatola, Peptide Backbone Modifications, Vega Data, 1(3):267 (1983); Spatola et al. <i>Life Sci. </i>38:1243-1249 (1986); Hudson et al. <i>Int. J. Pept. Res. </i>14:177-185 (1979); and Weinstein. B., 1983, Chemistry and Biochemistry, of Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins, Weinstein eds, Marcel Dekker, New-York,). Such peptide mimetics may have significant advantages over naturally-occurring polypeptides including more economical production, greater chemical stability, enhanced pharmacological properties (e.g., half-life, absorption, potency, efficiency, etc.), reduced antigenicity and others.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0077">Ang-(1-7) peptides also include other types of peptide derivatives containing additional chemical moieties not normally part of the peptide, provided that the derivative retains the desired functional activity of the peptide. Examples of such derivatives include (1) N-acyl derivatives of the amino terminal or of another free amino group, wherein the acyl group may be an alkanoyl group (e.g., acetyl, hexanoyl, octanoyl) an aroyl group (e.g., benzoyl) or a blocking group such as F-moc (fluorenylmethyl-OâCOâ); (2) esters of the carboxy terminal or of another free carboxy or hydroxyl group; (3) amide of the carboxy-terminal or of another free carboxyl group produced by reaction with ammonia or with a suitable amine; (4) phosphorylated derivatives; (5) derivatives conjugated to an antibody or other biological ligand and other types of derivatives; and (6) derivatives conjugated to a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0078">Ang-(1-7) peptides may be obtained by any method of peptide synthesis known to those skilled in the art, including synthetic (e.g., exclusive solid phase synthesis, partial solid phase synthesis, fragment condensation, classical solution synthesis, native-chemical ligation) and recombinant techniques. For example, the peptides or peptides derivatives can be obtained by solid phase peptide synthesis, which in brief, consist of coupling the carboxyl group of the C-terminal amino acid to a resin (e.g., benzhydrylamine resin, chloromethylated resin, hydroxymethyl resin) and successively adding N-alpha protected amino acids. The protecting groups may be any such groups known in the art. Before each new amino acid is added to the growing chain, the protecting group of the previous amino acid added to the chain is removed. Such solid phase synthesis has been disclosed, for example, by Merrifield, <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>85: 2149 (1964); Vale et al., <i>Science </i>213:1394-1397 (1981), in U.S. Pat.

Comm. 650 (1970) by techniques reviewed in Lubell et al. âPeptidesâ Science of Synthesis 21.11, Chemistry of Amides. Thieme, Stuttgart, 713-809 (2005). The coupling of amino acids to appropriate resins is also well known in the art and has been disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,244,946. (Reviewed in Houver-Weyl, <i>Methods of Organic Chemistry</i>.

      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0079">Unless defined otherwise, the scientific and technological terms and nomenclature used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill to which this invention pertains. Generally, the procedures of cell cultures, infection, molecular biology methods and the like are common methods used in the art. Such standard techniques can be found in reference manuals such as, for example, Ausubel et al., <i>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</i>, Wiley Interscience, New York, 2001; and Sambrook et al., <i>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, </i>3<sup>rd </sup>edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, N.Y., 2001.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0080">During any process of the preparation of an Ang-(1-7) peptide, it may be desirable to protect sensitive reactive groups on any of the molecule concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups such as those described in Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis by T. W. Greene &amp; P. G. M. Wuts, 1991, John Wiley and Sons, New-York; and Peptides: chemistry and Biology by Sewald and Jakubke, 2002, Wiley-VCH, Wheinheim p.142. For example, alpha amino protecting groups include acyl type protecting groups (e.g., trifluoroacetyl, formyl, acetyl), aliphatic urethane protecting groups (e.g., t-butyloxycarbonyl (BOC), cyclohexyloxycarbonyl), aromatic urethane type protecting groups (e.g., fluorenyl-9-methoxy-carbonyl (Fmoc), benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), Cbz derivatives) and alkyl type protecting groups (e.g., triphenyl methyl, benzyl). The amino acids side chain protecting groups include benzyl (for Thr and Ser), Cbz (Tyr, Thr, Ser, Arg, Lys), methyl ethyl, cyclohexyl (Asp, His), Boc (Arg, His, Cys) etc. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0081">Further, Ang-(1-7) peptides may be synthesized according to the FMOC protocol in an organic phase with protective groups. Desirably, the peptides are purified with a yield of 70% with high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C18 chromatography column and eluted with an acetonitrile gradient of 10-60%. The molecular weight of a peptide can be verified by mass spectrometry (reviewed in Fields, G. B. âSolid-Phase Peptide Synthesisâ <i>Methods in Enzymology. Vol. </i>289, Academic Press, 1997).</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0082">Alternatively, Ang-(1-7) peptides may be prepared in recombinant systems using, for example, polynucleotide sequences encoding the polypeptides. It is understood that a polypeptide may contain more than one of the above-described modifications within the same polypeptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0083">While peptides may be effective in eliciting a biological activity in vitro, their effectiveness in vivo might be reduced by the presence of proteases. Serum proteases have specific substrate requirements. The substrate must have both L-amino acids and peptide bonds for cleavage. Furthermore, exopeptidases, which represent the most prominent component of the protease activity in serum, usually act on the first peptide bond of the peptide and require a free N-terminus (Powell et al., <i>Pharm. Res. </i>10:1268-1273 (1993)). In light of this, it is often advantageous to use modified versions of peptides. The modified peptides retain the structural characteristics of the original L-amino acid peptides that confer the desired biological activity of Ang-(1-7) but are advantageously not readily susceptible to cleavage by protease and/or exopeptidases.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0084">Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may be used to generate more stable peptides. Thus, a peptide derivative or peptidomimetic of the present invention may be all L, all D or mixed D, L peptide, in either forward or reverse order. The presence of an N-terminal or C-terminal D-amino acid increases the in vivo stability of a peptide since peptidases cannot utilize a D-amino acid as a substrate (Powell et al., <i>Pharm. Res. </i>10:1268-1273 (1993)). Reverse-D peptides are peptides containing D-amino acids, arranged in a reverse sequence relative to a peptide containing L-amino acids. Thus, the C-terminal residue of an L-amino acid peptide becomes N-terminal for the D-amino acid peptide, and so forth. Reverse D-peptides retain the same secondary conformation and therefore similar activity, as the L-amino acid peptides, but are more resistant to enzymatic degradation in vitro and in vivo, and thus can have greater therapeutic efficacy than the original peptide (Brady and Dodson, <i>Nature </i>368:692-693 (1994); Jameson et al., <i>Nature </i>368:744-746 (1994)). Similarly, a reverse-L peptide may be generated using standard methods where the C-terminus of the parent peptide becomes takes the place of the N-terminus of the reverse-L peptide. It is contemplated that reverse L-peptides of L-amino acid peptides that do not have significant secondary structure (e.g., short peptides) retain the same spacing and conformation of the side chains of the L-amino acid peptide and therefore often have the similar activity as the original L-amino acid peptide. Moreover, a reverse peptide may contain a combination of L- and D-amino acids. The spacing between amino acids and the conformation of the side chains may be retained resulting in similar activity as the original L-amino acid peptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0085">Another effective approach to confer resistance to peptidases acting on the N-terminal or C-terminal residues of a peptide is to add chemical groups at the peptide termini, such that the modified peptide is no longer a substrate for the peptidase. One such chemical modification is glycosylation of the peptides at either or both termini. Certain chemical modifications, in particular N-terminal glycosylation, have been shown to increase the stability of peptides in human serum (Powell et al., <i>Pharm. Res. </i>10:1268-1273 (1993)). Other chemical modifications which enhance serum stability include, but are not limited to, the addition of an N-terminal alkyl group, consisting of a lower alkyl of from one to twenty carbons, such as an acetyl group, and/or the addition of a C-terminal amide or substituted amide group. In particular, the present invention includes modified peptides consisting of peptides bearing an N-terminal acetyl group and/or a C-terminal amide group.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0086">Substitution of non-naturally-occurring amino acids for natural amino acids in a subsequence of the peptides can also confer resistance to proteolysis. Such a substitution can, for instance, confer resistance to proteolysis by exopeptidases acting on the N-terminus without affecting biological activity. Examples of non-naturally-occurring amino acids include Î±,Î±-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, C-Î±-methyl amino acids, Î²-amino acids, and Î²-methyl amino acids. Amino acids analogs useful in the present invention may include, but are not limited to, Î²-alanine, norvaline, norleucine, 4-aminobutyric acid, orithine, hydroxyproline, sarcosine, citrulline, cysteic acid, cyclohexylalanine, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, 6-aminohexanoic acid, t-butylglycine, phenylglycine, o-phosphoserine, N-acetyl serine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine and other unconventional amino acids. Furthermore, the synthesis of peptides with non-naturally-occurring amino acids is routine in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0087">In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods well known in the art (Rizo and Gierasch, <i>Ann. Rev. Biochem. </i>61:387-418 (1992)). For example, constrained peptides may be generated by adding cysteine residues capable of forming disulfide bridges and, thereby, resulting in a cyclic peptide. Cyclic peptides can be constructed to have no free N- or C-termini. Accordingly, they are not susceptible to proteolysis by exopeptidases, although they may be susceptible to endopeptidases, which do not cleave at peptide termini. The amino acid sequences of the peptides with N-terminal or C-terminal D-amino acids and of the cyclic peptides are usually identical to the sequences of the peptides to which they correspond, except for the presence of N-terminal or C-terminal D-amino acid residue, or their circular structure, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0088">Cyclic Peptides</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0089">In some embodiments, a functional equivalent, analogue or derivative of naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7) is a cyclic peptide. As used herein, a cyclic peptide has an intramolecular covalent bond between two non-adjacent residues. The intramolecular bond may be a backbone to backbone, side-chain to backbone or side-chain to side-chain bond (i.e., terminal functional groups of a linear peptide and/or side-chain functional groups of a terminal or interior residue may be linked to achieve cyclization). Typical intramolecular bonds include disulfide, amide and thioether bonds. A variety of means for cyclizing polypeptides are well known in the art, as are many other modifications that can be made to such peptides. For a general discussion, see International Patent Publication Nos. WO 01/53331 and WO 98/02452, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Such cyclic bonds and other modifications can also be applied to the cyclic peptides and derivative compounds of this invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0090">Cyclic peptides as described herein may comprise residues of L-amino acids, D-amino acids, or any combination thereof. Amino acids may be from natural or non-natural sources, provided that at least one amino group and at least one carboxyl group are present in the molecule; Î±- and Î²-amino acids are generally preferred. Cyclic peptides may also contain one or more rare amino acids (such as 4-hydroxyproline or hydroxylysine), organic acids or amides and/or derivatives of common amino acids, such as amino acids having the C-terminal carboxylate esterified (e.g., benzyl, methyl or ethyl ester) or amidated and/or having modifications of the N-terminal amino group (e.g., acetylation or alkoxycarbonylation), with or without any of a wide variety of side-chain modifications and/or substitutions (e.g., methylation, benzylation, t-butylation, tosylation, alkoxycarbonylation, and the like). Suitable derivatives include amino acids having an N-acetyl group (such that the amino group that represents the N-terminus of the linear peptide prior to cyclization is acetylated) and/or a C-terminal amide group (i.e., the carboxy terminus of the linear peptide prior to cyclization is amidated). Residues other than common amino acids that may be present with a cyclic peptide include, but are not limited to, penicillamine,Î²,Î²-tetramethylene cysteine, Î²,Î²-pentamethylene cysteine, Î²-mercaptopropionic acid, Î²,Î²-pentamethylene-Î²-mercaptopropionic acid, 2-mercaptobenzene, 2-mercaptoaniline, 2-mercaptoproline, ornithine, diaminobutyric acid, Î±-aminoadipic acid, m-aminomethylbenzoic acid and Î±,Î²-diaminopropionic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0091">Following synthesis of a linear peptide, with or without N-acetylation and/or C-amidation, cyclization may be achieved by any of a variety of techniques well known in the art. Within one embodiment, a bond may be generated between reactive amino acid side chains. For example, a disulfide bridge may be formed from a linear peptide comprising two thiol-containing residues by oxidizing the peptide using any of a variety of methods. Within one such method, air oxidation of thiols can generate disulfide linkages over a period of several days using either basic or neutral aqueous media. The peptide is used in high dilution to minimize aggregation and intermolecular side reactions. Alternatively, strong oxidizing agents such as I<sub>2 </sub>and K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6 </sub>can be used to form disulfide linkages. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that care must be taken not to oxidize the sensitive side chains of Met, Tyr, Trp or His. Within further embodiments, cyclization may be achieved by amide bond formation. For example, a peptide bond may be formed between terminal functional groups (i.e., the amino and carboxy termini of a linear peptide prior to cyclization). Within another such embodiment, the linear peptide comprises a D-amino acid. Alternatively, cyclization may be accomplished by linking one terminus and a residue side chain or using two side chains, with or without an N-terminal acetyl group and/or a C-terminal amide. Residues capable of forming a lactam bond include lysine, ornithine (Orn), Î±-amino adipic acid, m-aminomethylbenzoic acid, Î±,Î²-diaminopropionic acid, glutamate or aspartate. Methods for forming amide bonds are generally well known in the art. Within one such method, carbodiimide-mediated lactam formation can be accomplished by reaction of the carboxylic acid with DCC, DIC, ED AC or DCCI, resulting in the formation of an O-acylurea that can be reacted immediately with the free amino group to complete the cyclization. Alternatively, cyclization can be performed using the azide method, in which a reactive azide intermediate is generated from an alkyl ester via a hydrazide. Alternatively, cyclization can be accomplished using activated esters. The presence of electron withdrawing substituents on the alkoxy carbon of esters increases their susceptibility to aminolysis. The high reactivity of esters of p-nitrophenol, N-hydroxy compounds and polyhalogenated phenols has made these âactive estersâ useful in the synthesis of amide bonds. Within a further embodiment, a thioether linkage may be formed between the side chain of a thiol-containing residue and an appropriately derivatized Î±-amino acid. By way of example, a lysine side chain can be coupled to bromoacetic acid through the carbodiimide coupling method (DCC, EDAC) and then reacted with the side chain of any of the thiol containing residues mentioned above to form a thioether linkage. In order to form dithioethers, any two thiol containing side-chains can be reacted with dibromoethane and diisopropylamine in DMF.</p>

Without limitation, some suitable absorption enhancers include: (a) salicylates such as sodium salicylate, 3-methoxysalicylate, 5-methoxysalicylate and homovanilate; (b) bile acids such as taurocholic, tauorodeoxycholic, deoxycholic, cholic, glycholic, lithocholate, chenodeoxycholic, ursodeoxycholic, ursocholic, dehydrocholic, fusidic, etc.; (c) non-ionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene ethers (e.g. Brij 36T, Brij 52, Brij 56, Brij 76, Brij 96, Texaphor A6, Texaphor A14, Texaphor A60 etc.), p-t-octyl phenol polyoxyethylenes (Triton X-45, Triton X-100, Triton X-114, Triton X-305 etc.) nonylphenoxypoloxyethylenes (e.g. Igepal CO series), polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters (e.g. Tween-20, Tween-80 etc.); (d) anionic surfactants such as dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate; (e) lyso-phospholipids such as lysolecithin and lysophosphatidylethanolamine; (f) acylcarnitines, acylcholines and acyl amino acids such as lauroylcarnitine, myristoylcarnitine, palmitoylcarnitine, lauroylcholine, myristoylcholine, palmitoylcholine, hexadecyllysine, N-acylphenylalanine, N-acylglycine etc.; g) water soluble phospholipids such as diheptanoylphosphatidylcholine, dioctylphosphatidylcholine etc.; (h) medium-chain glycerides which are mixtures of mono-, di- and triglycerides containing medium-chain-length fatty acids (caprylic, capric and lauric acids); (i) ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid; (j) cationic surfactants such as cetylpyridinium chloride; (k) fatty acid derivatives of polyethylene glycol such as Labrasol, Labrafac, etc.; and (l) alkylsaccharides such as lauroyl maltoside, lauroyl sucrose, myristoyl sucrose, palmitoyl sucrose, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0166">In some embodiments, the absorption enhancer(s) will be present in a quantity measured as a percent by weight, relative to the overall weight of the pharmaceutical composition (typically exclusive of enteric coating). By way of additional non-limiting example, the quantity of absorption enhancer present in an embodiment may range from 0.1 to 20 percent by weight; from 0.5 to 20 percent by weight; from 1.0 to 20 percent by weight, from 2.0 to 20 percent by weight, from 3.0 to 20 percent by weight, from 4.0 to 20 percent by weight, from from 5.0 to 20 percent by weight, from 5.0 to 15 percent by weight, from 5.0 to 14 percent by weight, from 5.0 to 13 percent by weight, from 5.0 to 12 percent by weight, from 5.0 to 12 percent by weight, from 5.0 to 11 percent by weight, from 5.0 to 10 percent by weight, from 6.0 to 10 percent by weight, from 7.0 to 10 percent by weight, from 8.0 to 10 percent by weight, from 9.0 to 10 percent by weight, from 5.0 to 9.0 percent by weight, from 5.0 to 8.0 percent by weight, from 5.0 to 7.0 percent by weight, and from 5.0 to 6.0 percent by weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0167">In some embodiments, the weight ratio of pH-lowering agent(s) to absorption enhancer(s) may be about 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, 10:1, 11:1, 12:1, 13:1, 14:1, 15:1, 16:1, 17:1, 18:1, 19:1, 20:1 or between any two of the foregoing exemplary ratios. The total weight of all pH-lowering agents and the total weight of all absorption enhancers in a given pharmaceutical composition is included in the foregoing exemplary ratios. For example, if a pharmaceutical composition includes two pH-lowering agents and three absorption enhancers, the foregoing ratios will be computed on the total combined weight of both pH-lowering agents and the total combined weight of all three absorption enhancers.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0168">In some embodiments, the absorption enhancer(s) will be soluble at acid pH, such as less than pH 5.5, and in particular, between pH 3.0 and pH 5.0.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="2">Protective Vehicles</heading>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0169">As used herein, a protective vehicle refers to any protective component and/or structure, such as a carrier, a layer, a coating or other vehicle, that protects an active peptide (e.g., an angiotensin (1-7) peptide) from stomach proteases. Typically, a protective vehicle dissolves eventually so that the active and other ingredients in a particular dosage form may be released. A common form of protective vehicle is an enteric coating. In some embodiments, a suitable enteric costing may prevent breakdown of the pharmaceutical composition of the invention in 0.1N HCl for at least two hours, then capable of permitting complete release of all contents of the pharmaceutical composition within thirty minutes after pH is increased to 6.3 in a dissolution bath in which said composition is rotating at 100 revolutions per minute.</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0170">Many enteric coatings are known in the art and are useful in one or more embodiments. Non-limiting examples of enteric coatings include cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylethylcellulose succinate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, carboxyl methylethylcellulose and methacrylic acid-methyl methacrylate copolymer. In some embodiments, an angiotensin (1-7) peptide, absorption enhancers such as solubility and/or uptake enhancer(s), and pH-lowering agent(s), are included in a sufficiently viscous protective syrup to permit protected passage of the components of the embodiment through the stomach.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0171">Suitable enteric coatings may be applied, for example, to capsules after the active and other components of the invention have been loaded within the capsule. In other embodiments, enteric coating is coated on the outside of a tablet or coated on the outer surface of particles of active components which are then pressed into tablet form, or loaded into a capsule.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0172">In some embodiments it may be desirable that all components of the invention be released from the carrier or vehicle, and solubilized in the intestinal environment as simultaneously as possible. It may also be preferred in some embodiments that the vehicle or carrier release the active components in the small intestine where uptake enhancers that increase transcellular or paracellular transport are less likely to cause undesirable side effects than if the same uptake enhancers were later released in the colon. It will be appreciated, however, that the present invention is believed effective in the colon as well as in the small intestine. Numerous vehicles or carriers, in addition to the ones discussed above, are known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0173">In some embodiments, it may be desirable (especially in optimizing how simultaneously the components of the invention are released) to keep the amount of enteric coating low. In some embodiments, an enteric coating adds no more than 30% to the weight of the remainder of pharmaceutical composition such as a solid dosage form (the âremainderâ being the pharmaceutical composition exclusive of enteric coating itself). In other embodiments, an enteric coating adds less than 20%, less than 19%, less than 18%, less than 17%, less than 16%, less than 15%, less than 14%, less than 13%, less than 12%, less than 11%, or less than 10%. In some embodiments, a protective vehicle such as an enteric coating constitutes an amount of or less than approximately 25%, 24%, 23%, 22%, 21%, 20%, 19%, 18%, 17%, 16%, 15%, 14%, 13%, 12%, 11%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5% of the total weight of a pharmaceutical composition (e.g., a solid dosage form).</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="2">Dosage Forms</heading>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0174">As used herein, dosage forms refer to a mixture of active drug components and nondrug components. Various dosage forms may be used according to the invention, including but not limited to, liquid dosage forms, solid dosage forms and semisolid dosage forms. Common dosage forms include pill, tablet, capsule, drink or syrup. In some embodiments, solid dosage forms such as pill, tablet or capsule are used.</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0175">Typically, a particularly desirable dosage form provides simultaneous release of the angiotensin-(1-7) peptide, pH-lowering agent and absorption enhancers. This is highly desirable because the acid is best able to reduce undesirable proteolytic attack on the peptide when the acid is released in close time proximity to release of the peptide. Near simultaneous release is best achieved by administering all components of the invention as a single pill, tablet or capsule.</p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0176">Various embodiments may optionally include common pharmaceutical excipients such as diluents, glycants, lubricants, gelatin capsules, preservatives, colorants and the like in their usual known sizes and amounts. Exemplary, non-limiting excipients include pro-salts, polyplastum and sodium stearyl fumerate. In some embodiments, another peptide (such as albumin, casein, soy protein, other animal or vegetable proteins and the like) is included to reduce non-specific adsorption (e.g., binding of angiotensin (1-7) peptide to the intestinal mucus barrier) thereby lowering the necessary concentration of the expensive peptide active agent. When added, the additional peptide is typically from 1.0 to 10.0 percent by weight relative to the weight of the overall pharmaceutical composition (excluding protective vehicle). Typically, this additional peptide is not physiologically active and is most preferably a food peptide such as soy bean peptide or the like. Without intending to be bound by theory, this second peptide may also increase bioavailability by acting as a protease scavenger that desirably competes with the peptide active agent for protease interaction. The second peptide may also aid the active compound's passage through the liver.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0177">In some embodiments, the pH-lowering agent(s), the angiotensin (1-7) peptide, the absorption enhancer(s) and other excipients (whether single compounds or a plurality of compounds in each category) be uniformly dispersed in a dosage form. In other embodiments, a dosage form may comprise granules that include a pharmaceutical binder having the angiotensin (1-7) peptide, the pH-lowering agent and the absorption enhancer uniformly dispersed within said binder. In yet other embodiments, granules may also consist of an acid core, surrounded by a uniform layer of organic acid, a layer of enhancer and a layer of peptide that is surrounded by an outer layer of organic acid. Granules may be prepared from an aqueous mixture consisting of pharmaceutical binders such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, together with the pH-lowering agents, absorption enhancers and peptide active agents of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0178">As described, various embodiments may have differing amounts of ingredients and differing ingredients as well. Regardless of the recipe of a particular embodiment, the total weight of all ingredients present in that embodiment may fall within a certain weight range, such as from about 500-1500 (e.g., from about 500-1200 mg, 500-1000 mg, 600-1500 mg, 600-1200 mg, 600-1000 mg, 700-1500 mg, 700-1200 mg, 700-1000 mg, 800-1500 mg, 800-1200 mg, 800-1000 mg). In some embodiments, a suitable solid dosage form has a total weight of or greater than about 500 mg, 600 mg, 700 mg, 800 mg, 900 mg, 1000 mg, 1100 mg, 1200 mg, 1300 mg, 1400 mg, or 1500 mg. In some embodiments, a suitable solid dosage form has a total weight of or less than about 2000 mg, 1900 mg, 1800 mg, 1700 mg, 1600 mg, 1500 mg, 1400 mg, 1300 mg, 1200 mg, 1100 mg, 1000 mg, 900 mg, 800 mg, 700 mg, 600 mg, or 500 mg.</p>

      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0179">This example demonstrates that angiotensin (1-7) can be effectively delivered orally using an exemplary formulation according to the present invention. Specifically, the feasibility of orally delivering an angiotensin (1-7) peptide was demonstrated by administrating it in a liquid formulation to an anesthetized rat via intra-duodenal injection (ID). This model mimics the release and absorption expected from an orally delivered enteric coated solid dosage form such as capsule or tablet.</p>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0180">Initially, a baseline pharmacokinetic profile in female Sprague-Dawley rats was obtained by subcutaneous (SC) administration of angiotensin (1-7) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Blood samples (0.6 ml) was taken from a cannula implanted into the right carotid artery before and 5, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after the injection of the peptide and replaced with an equal volume of heparinized saline.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0181">After extraction, the samples were then transferred to ice-cold tubes containing a protease inhibitor cocktail. The samples were kept on ice until they were centrifuged at 4Â° C. to obtain plasma. The plasma supernatants were then frozen â70Â° C. until analysis using an LC-MS assay.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0182">Table 1 summarized exemplary individual baseline A(1-7) levels achieved at the designated time points and the non-compartmental PK values. Three rats were administered 0.3 mL of 10 mg/mL A(1-7) as a subcutaneous injection. The pharmacokinetics of A(1-7) were determined using a non-compartmental model, where individual pharmacokinetics were determined. The mean concentration for each time point was calculated and the PK values for these mean values were estimated. The Tmax was achieved approximately 10 to 90 minutes after administration. Half-lives are approximately 15 minutes for this treatment group. Total mean A(1-7) exposure over the observation period was 614 ng*min/mL with a range of 585 to 656 ng*min/mL.</p>

      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0183">The oral delivery of an angiotensin (1-7) peptide (e.g., TXA127) was then evaluated in a rat model that mimics the release of the peptide into the intestine by enteric-coated capsule. Briefly, the duodenums of anesthetized rats were surgically exposed, and an angiotensin (1-7) peptide was delivered through a 27 gauge needle into the duodenum. A baseline was obtained by ID administration of an angiotensin (1-7) in PBS. Samples of blood was removed from the carotid artery before and 5, 10, 20, 40, 60 and 90 minutes after peptide administration. Subsequently, an angiotensin (1-7) peptide was administered ID in 400 mM citrate buffer (pH 3.5) and lauroyl-L-carnitine (LLC) (10 mg/ml), a formulation that mimics the contents of the enteric-coated capsules. In order to maximize the stability of TXA127 in rat circulation, captopril (e.g., 0.5 mg/ml or 5 mg/ml) may be added to the formulations. Blood samples were taken at the same time points as the baseline study and handled as described above for analysis. Exemplary results were summarized in Tables 2-5.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0184">Table 2 summarizes exemplary results from a total of 6 rats treated with 0.3 mL of 10 mg/mL Angiotensin (1-7) (A(1-7)) formulated in PBS. The pharmacokinetics of A(1-7) were determined using a non-compartmental model. The average concentration for each time point was calculated and the PK values for these mean values were estimated. These were compared with the mean PK values, which were calculated by taking the average of all individual PK parameters. The Tmax was achieved approximately 10 to 60 minutes after administration. Half-lives ranged from 7 to 140 minutes for this treatment group. Total mean A(1-7) exposure over the observation period was 403 ng*min/mL with a range of 123 to 881 ng*min/mL.</p>

      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0186">Table 4 summarizes exemplary pharmacokinetics results from seven rats administered with 0.3 mL of 10 mg/mL A(1-7) in a preparation containing 0.5 mg/mL captopril, 10 mg/mL LLC, 400 mM Citrate, 150 mM NaCl at pH 3.5. The pharmacokinetics of A(1-7) were determined using a non-compartmental model. The average concentration for each time point was calculated and the PK values for these mean values were estimated. These mean concentration values were compared with the mean PK values, which is calculated by taking the average of all individual PK parameters. AUCs were determined using values &gt;1,000 ng/mL to provide a perspective of the range of exposure. In addition mean concentration for each time point was calculated and the PK values for these mean values were estimated. The Tmax was achieved approximately 5 to 10 minutes after administration. Half-lives ranged from 11.9 to 29.1 minutes for this treatment group. Total mean A(1-7) exposure over the observation period was 7,152 ng*min/mL with a range of 1,969 to 9,257 ng*min/mL.</p>

      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0187">Table 5 summarizes exemplary A(1-7) levels achieved in six rats given 0.3 mL of 10 mg/mL A(1-7) in a preparation containing 0.5 mg/mL captopril, 10 mg/mL LLC, 400 mM Citrate, 150 mM NaCl at pH 3.5. Again, the pharmacokinetic parameters of A(1-7) was determined using a non-compartmental model, where individual pharmacokinetics parameters were also determined. In this analysis, AUCs were determined using values &gt;1,000 ng/mL to provide a perspective of the range of exposure. The mean concentration for each time point was calculated and the PK values for these mean values were estimated. The Tmax was achieved approximately 5 to 10 minutes after administration. Half-lives ranged from 7.97 to 25.6 minutes for this treatment group. Total mean A(1-7) exposure over the observation period was 9,399 ng*min/mL with a range of 1,008 to 26,654 ng*min/mL.</p>
