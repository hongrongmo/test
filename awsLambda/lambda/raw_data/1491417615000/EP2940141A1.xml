    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for the production of 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid (also referred to as beta-hydroxyisovalerate or HIV) from acetone and a compound which provides an activated acetyl group comprising the enzymatic conversion of acetone and a compound which provides an activated acetyl group into 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid.

The present invention also relates to organisms able to produce 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid from acetone and a compound which provides an activated acetyl group and to the use of the above-mentioned enzymes and organisms for the production of 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid. Finally, the present invention relates to the use of acetone for the production of 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid.</p>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid (also referred to as beta-hydroxyisovalerate or HIV; see <figref>Figure 1</figref>) is a metabolite of the essential amino acid leucine and is synthesized in the human body. It can be found in small quantities in grapefruit, alfalfa and catfish. It is also known to occur in some metabolic disorders of leucine catabolism, i.e. hypovaleric acidemia. It has been shown that 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid may have an effect on increasing muscle weight and strength (<nplcit id="ncit-00001" npl-type="s"><text>Nissen et al., J. Appl. Physiol. 81 (1996), 2095-2104</text></nplcit>). <nplcit id="ncit-00002" npl-type="s"><text>Wilson et al. (Nutrition &amp; Metabolism 5 (2008</text></nplcit>)) proposes as the mechanisms of action the following: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="dash" compact="compact"><li>increased sarcolemmal integrity via conversion by HMG CoA reductase</li><li>enhanced protein synthesis via the mTOR pathway</li><li>depression of protein degradation through inhibition of the ubiquitin pathway. 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid is supposed to help muscles combat protein breakdown, assist in muscle repair and support increased endurance. It has been described to help patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in hospital intensive care units, muscle wasting associated with HIV and cancer and trauma victims with severe injuries. Thus, it is of commercial interest because of its use as a muscle enhancer for bodybuilding and as a medicament for avoiding muscle wasting. United States Patent <patcit id="pcit-00001" dnum="US7026507B"><text>7026507</text></patcit> describes a process for preparing solid formulations of sodium 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate in which, in a first process step, 4,4-dimethyloxetan-2-one is reacted with aqueous sodium hydroxide to form a solution of sodium 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate, and then, if appropriate after concentration, the solution is applied, in a further process step, to synthetic silica, and in which the resultant product is, if appropriate, dried.</li></ul></p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">It would be desirable to provide a process for the production of 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate which would be independent of inorganic production steps and which could be effected in living organisms thereby being environmentally sound and inexpensive. In this context, <nplcit id="ncit-00003" npl-type="s"><text>Lee et al. (Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 63 (1997), 4191-4195</text></nplcit>) describes a method for the production of 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate by converting 3-methylbutyric acid to 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid using the microorganism Galactomyces reessii. However, although this process allowed the production of 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate there is still a need to provide alternative efficient and cost effective ways of producing 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate in particular by biological processes.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The present invention meets this demand for an alternative process for the production of 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate and provides a method which is based on biological resources and allows to produce 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate in vitro or in vivo in a microorganism and other species.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In particular, the present invention relates to a method for the production of 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid (also referred to as beta-hydroxyisovalerate or HIV) from acetone and a compound which provides an activated acetyl group comprising the enzymatic conversion of acetone and a compound which provides an activated acetyl group into 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Acetone is represented by the following formula: CH<sub>3</sub>-(C=O)-CH<sub>3</sub>. In a preferred embodiment the compound which provides an activated acetyl group is characterized by the following formula (I): <chemistry id="chem-00001-en" num="0001"><img id="img-00001-en" wi="33" he="34" img-content="chem" file="EP2940141A1_00009.PNG" img-format="png" original="imgb0001.tif" /></chemistry> ,wherein X is selected from the group consisting of S-CH2-CH2-NH-CO-CH2-CH2-NH-CO-CH(OH)-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-PO2H-C10H13N5O7P (coenzyme A), S-CH2-CH2-NH-CO-CH2-CH2-NH-CO-CH(OH)-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-PO2H-polypeptide (acyl-carrier protein), S-CH2-CH2-NH-CO-CH2-CH2-NH-CO-CH(OH)-C(CH3)2-CH2-OH (pantetheine), S-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-NH-CO-CH<sub>3</sub> (N-acetyl-cysteamine), S-CH<sub>3</sub> (methane thiol), S-CH2-CH(NH2)-CO2H (cysteine), S-CH2-CH2-CH(NH2)-CO2H (homocysteine), S-CH2-CH(NH-C5H8NO3)-CO-NH-CH2-CO2H (glutathione), S-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-SO<sub>3</sub>H (coenzyme M) and OH (acetic acid).</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The conversion makes use of an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the formation of a covalent bond between the carbon atom of the oxo (i.e. the C=O) group of acetone and the carbon atom (C<sup>2</sup>) corresponding to the methyl group of the compound which provides an activated acetyl group according to formula (I). According to this reaction scheme the oxo group of acetone reacts as an electrophile and the methyl group of the compound which provides an activated acetyl group according to formula (I) reacts as a nucleophile. The general reaction of the conversion of acetone and a compound which provides an activated acetyl group according to formula (I) is shown in <figref>Figure 5</figref>.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The reaction can occur in one step, i.e. 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate can be the direct product of a reaction catalyzed by the above described enzyme. Alternatively, the reaction may comprise two steps, in particular in the case where acetyl CoA is used as the compound which provides an activated acetyl group, in the sense that first an adduct of 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate and the compound which provides an activated acetyl group is produced, e.g. 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyryl-CoA, which is subsequently hydrolyzed, e.g. to 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate and CoA. Thus, in the first alternative the enzyme catalyzes the complete reaction as shown in <figref>Figure 5</figref>. In the second alternative, the enzyme catalyzes the formation of a covalent bond between the carbon atom of the oxo (i.e. the C=O) group of acetone and the carbon atom (C<sup>2</sup>) corresponding to the methyl group of the compound which provides an activated acetyl group but X stays in the molecule. X is then removed subsequently from the molecule by hydrolysis.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The present invention shows for the first time that it is possible to produce 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate by making use of an enzyme which can transfer an activated acetyl group to acetone. In the prior art production of 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate from isovaleric acid through bioconversion using the fungus Galactomyces reessii has been reported. However, considering that isovaleric acid is obtained from leucine through decarboxylation and that leucine itself derives in metabolism from the overall condensation of two molecules of pyruvate and one molecule of acetyl CoA, this production process is energetically unfavorable. The process of the present invention avoids this disadvantage.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In general, in the context of the present invention any enzyme could be used which accepts a compound which provides an activated acetyl group as defined above as one substrate as well as a substrate which contains as a component an acetone group. In one preferred embodiment, the enzyme is an enzyme which accepts acetyl CoA as a substrate. Examples for such enzymes are HMG CoA synthase, HMG CoA lyase or other C-C bond cleavage/condensation lyases. However, as will be explained below, also enzymes which normally use in the reaction that they catalyze in nature an acetyl-donor different from acetyl CoA, may use acetyl CoA or analogues thereof, e.g. the PksG protein.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In another preferred embodiment the enzyme is an enzyme which accepts as a substrate a compound which provides an activated acetyl group according to formula (I) in which X is an acyl-carrier-protein, such as the acetyl-S-AcpK protein encoded by the pksX gene cluster for producing bacillaene in Bacillus subtilis. An example for such an enzyme is the PksG protein. The PksG protein is one of the proteins encoded by the pksX gene cluster from Bacillus subtilis. The PksG protein is capable of catalyzing the transfer of a carboxymethyl group -CH<sub>2</sub>-CO<sub>2</sub> from acetyl-S-AcpK to a Î²-ketothioester polyketide intermediate linked to one of the thiolation domains of the PksL protein, in a reaction which is analogous to that catalyzed by HMG CoA synthase. However, it has been shown in the context of the present invention that the PksG protein can also use acetyl CoA instead of the acetyl-S-AcpK protein as a donor of an activated acetyl group.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In one preferred embodiment the compound which provides an activated acetyl group is acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA (also known as acetyl Coenzyme A) in chemical structure is the thioester between coenzyme A (a thiol) and acetic acid.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In another preferred embodiment the compound which provides an activated acetyl group has the formula (I) in which X is an acyl-carrier-protein, such as the acetyl-S-AcpK protein encoded by the pksX gene cluster for producing bacillaene in Bacillus subtilis.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Preferably, the enzyme employed in the process is an enzyme with the activity of a HMG CoA synthase (EC 2.3.3.10) and/or a PksG protein and/or an enzyme with the activity of a C-C bond cleavage/condensation lyase, such as a HMG CoA lyase (EC 4.1.3.4).</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In one preferred embodiment, the method according to the present invention comprises the enzymatic conversion of acetone and acetyl CoA into 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate with an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the formation of a covalent bond between the carbon atom of the oxo (i.e. the C=O) group of acetone and the carbon atom C<sup>2</sup> of acetyl CoA according to formula (I).</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In a preferred embodiment, the enzyme employed in the process according to the invention is an enzyme which has the activity of a HMG CoA synthase (EC 2.3.3.10) or an enzyme which has the activity of a PksG protein or an enzyme which has the activity of a C-C bond cleavage/condensation lyase, such as a HMG CoA lyase (EC 4.1.3.4).</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In particular, it has been shown in the context of the present invention that HMG CoA synthase can accept acetone instead of its normal substrate acetoacetyl-CoA thereby allowing the conversion of acetyl-CoA (or a compound according to formula (I)) and acetone into 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate.</p>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Moreover, it has been shown in the context of the present invention that the PksG protein can use acetyl CoA as a substrate instead of the Ac-S-AcpK protein and can catalyze the reaction which is normally catalyzed by HMG CoA synthase. Thus, it is contemplated that also the PksG protein, which catalyzes a reaction analogous to the reaction of HMG CoA synthase, will be able to catalyze the conversion of acetone and a compound of formula (I) into 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate. Moreover, it is contemplated that C-C bond cleavage/condensation lyases, such as HMG CoA lyase, can catalyze the conversion of acetyl-CoA and acetone into 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyryl-CoA which in turn can be hydrolysed to 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate and CoA.</p>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In the context of the present application the term "HMG CoA synthase" or "a protein/enzyme having the activity of a HMG CoA synthase" refers to any enzyme which is classified in the EC number EC 2.3.3.10 (formerly, HMG-CoA synthase has been classified as EC 4.1.3.5 but has been transferred to EC 2.3.3.10), in particular it refers to any enzyme which is able to catalyze the reaction where acetyl-CoA condenses with acetoacetyl-CoA to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) (see <figref>Figure 2</figref>) and the term also refers to any enzyme which is derived from such a HMG CoA synthase and which is capable of catalyzing the conversion of acetone and a compound which provides an activated acetyl group as defined above, preferably acetyl CoA, into 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The enzymatic activity of condensing acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) can be measured by methods well known in the art. One possible and preferably used assay is described, e.g., in <nplcit id="ncit-00004" npl-type="s"><text>Clinkenbeard et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 250 (1975), 3108-3116</text></nplcit>). In this assay HMG-CoA synthase activity is measured by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 303 nm that accompanies the acetyl-CoA-dependent disappearance of the enolate form of acetoacetyl-CoA. Preferably HMG CoA synthase activity is assayed as described in Example 3.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">HMG CoA synthase is part of the mevalonate pathway. Two pathways have been identified for the synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), i.e. the mevalonate pathway and the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate-pyruvate pathway. HMG CoA synthase catalyzes the biological Claisen condensation of acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA and is a member of a superfamily of acyl-condensing enzymes that includes beta-ketothiolases, fatty acid synthases (beta-ketoacyl carrier protein synthase) and polyketide synthases.</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">HMG CoA synthase has been described for various organisms. Also amino acid and nucleic acid sequences encoding HMG CoA synthases from numerous sources are available. Generally, the sequences only share a low degree of overall sequence identity. For example, the enzymes from Staphylococcus or Streptococcus show only about 20% identity to those of human and avian HMG CoA synthase. In some sources it is reported that the bacterial HMG CoA synthases and their animal counterparts exhibit only about 10% overall sequence identity (<nplcit id="ncit-00005" npl-type="s"><text>Sutherlin et al., J. Bacteriol. 184 (2002), 4065-4070</text></nplcit>). However, the amino acid residues involved in the acetylation and condensation reactions are conserved among bacterial and eukaryotic HMG CoA synthases (<nplcit id="ncit-00006" npl-type="s"><text>Campobasso et al., J. Biol. Chem. 279 (2004), 44883-44888</text></nplcit>). The three-dimensional structure of three HMG CoA synthase enzymes has been determined and the amino acids crucial for the enzymatic reaction are in principle well characterized (Campobasso et al., loc. cit.; <nplcit id="ncit-00007" npl-type="s"><text>Chun et al., J. Biol.Chem. 275 (2000), 17946-17953</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit-00008" npl-type="s"><text>Nagegowda et al., Biochem. J. 383 (2004), 517-527</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit-00009" npl-type="s"><text>Hegardt, Biochem. J. 338 (1999), 569-582</text></nplcit>). In eukaryotes there exist two forms of the HMG CoA synthase, i.e. a cytosolic and a mitochondrial form. The cytosolic form plays a key role in the production of cholesterol and other isoprenoids and the mitochondrial form is involved in the production of ketone bodies.</p>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In principle any HMG CoA synthase enzyme can be used in the context of the present invention, in particular from prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms.</p>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Prokaryotic HMG CoA synthases are described, e.g., from Staphylococcus aureus (Campobasso et al., loc. cit.; Uniprot accession number Q9FD87), Staphylococcus epidermidis (Uniprot accession number Q9FD76), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (Uniprot accession number Q9FD82), Enterococcus faecalis (Sutherlin et al., loc. cit.; Unirprot accession number Q9FD7), Enterococcus faecium (Uniprot accession number Q9FD66), Streptococcus pneumonia (Uniprot accession number Q9FD56), Streptococcus pyogenes (Uniprot accession number Q9FD61) and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (accession number AE000857), Borrelia burgdorferi (NCBI accession number BB0683).</p>

An assay for measuring the capacity of a HMG CoA synthase to use acetone as a substrate is described in Example 5. The formation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate can be detected by comparison with standard compound, e.g. after separation by thin-layer chromatography, LC/MS and colorimetric assay after its derivatization or by mass spectrometry.</p>

Thus, in order to develop variants of HMG CoA synthase which show a lower acceptance of acetoacetyl-CoA as a substrate but which accept acetone as a substrate, it is conceivable to systematically mutate in a HMG CoA synthase the histidine residue which corresponds to His264 of the avian HMG CoA synthase described in Misraa et al.

    <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Another example for a protein which can be used in a method according to the invention is a PksG protein. In the context of the present application the term "PksG protein" or "a protein/enzyme having the activity of a PksG protein" refers to any enzyme which is able to catalyze the reaction which is naturally catalyzed by the PksG protein, i.e the transfer of -CH<sub>2</sub>COO<sup>-</sup> from acetyl-S-AcpK (Ac-S-AcpK) to a Î²-ketothioester polyketide intermediate linked to one of the thiolation domains of the PksL protein. This is a reaction which is analogous to that catalyzed by HMG CoA synthase with the difference that the acetyl-thioester of the phosphopantetheyl moiety is attached to a carrier protein rather than to part of Coenzyme A. Although the PksG protein in the reaction which it naturally catalyzes transfers the acetyl group from acetyl-S-AcpK to an acceptor, it has been shown in the context of the present invention that the PksG protein can also effect the reaction which is normally catalyzed by HMG CoA synthase, i.e. the synthesis of HMG CoA starting from acetoacetyl CoA and acetyl CoA (see Example 3 where it is shown in Table 1 that the enzyme from Mycobacterium marinum (B2HGT6) can act on acetoacetyl CoA and acetyl CoA).</p>

SEQ ID NO: 17 shows the sequence of the HMG CoA lyase of Zea mays (Accession number B6U7B9, gene bank ACG45252), SEQ ID NO: 18 shows the sequence of the HMG CoA lyase of Danio rerio (Brachydanio rerio; A8WG57, gene bank BC154587), SEQ ID NO: 19 shows the sequence of the HMG CoA lyase of Bos taurus (Uniprot accession number Q29448) and SEQ ID NO: 20 shows the sequence of the HMG CoA lyase of Homo sapiens (mitochondrial, Uniprot accession number P35914, gene bank HUMHYMEGLA), SEQ ID NO: 21 shows the sequence of the HMG CoA lyase of Pseudomonas putida (Q88H25), SEQ ID NO: 22 shows the sequence of the HMG CoA lyase of Acinetobacter baumannii (B7H4C6) and SEQ ID NO: 23 shows the sequence of the HMG CoA lyase of Thermus thermophilus (Q721H0).</p>
    <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the HMG CoA lyase is an enzyme comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 17 to 23 or a sequence which is at least n % identical to any of SEQ ID NOs: 17 to 23 and having the activity of a HMG CoA lyase with n being an integer between 10 and 100, preferably 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98 or 99.</p>
    <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">As regards the determination of the degree of sequence identity the same applies as has been set forth above in connection with HMG CoA synthase.</p>
    <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The HMG CoA lyase employed in the process according to the invention can be a naturally occurring HMG CoA lyase or it can be a HMG CoA lyase which is derived from a naturally occurring HMG CoA lyase, e.g. by the introduction of mutations or other alterations which, e.g., alter or improve the enzymatic activity, the stability, etc.</p>
    <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">The term "HMG CoA lyase" or "a protein/enzyme having the activity of a HMG CoA lyase" in the context of the present application also covers enzymes which are derived from a HMG CoA lyase, which are capable of producing 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyryl-CoA by a condensation of acetone and a compound which provides an activated acetyl group as defined above, preferably acetyl-CoA but which only have a low affinity to acetoacetate as a substrate or do no longer accept acetoacetate as a substrate. Such a modification of the preferred substrate of a HMG CoA lyase allows to improve the conversion of acetone into 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyryl-CoA and to reduce the production of the by-product HMG-CoA. Methods for modifying and/or improving the desired enzymatic activities of proteins are well-known to the person skilled in the art and have been described above.</p>
    <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The capacity of a given enzyme to catalyze the production of 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyryl-CoA can be determined in an assay as described in Example 6.</p>
    <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The modified version of the HMG CoA lyase accepting acetone as a substrate but having a low affinity to acetoacetate as a substrate or no longer accepting acetoacetate as a substrate may be derived from a naturally occurring HMG CoA lyase or from an already modified, optimized or synthetically synthesized HMG CoA lyase.</p>
    <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">In the process according to the invention it is possible to employ only one enzyme as defined above, e.g. only a HMG CoA synthase or only a HMG CoA lyase or only a PksG protein. However, it is of course also possible to employ more than one activity, i.e. different enzymes, in particular any combination of a HMG CoA synthase and a HMG CoA lyase and a PksG protein. E.g., in the case of an in vitro method, more than one enzyme activity can be added to the reaction mixture, either simultaneously or subsequently in any possible order. In an in vivo method employing organisms, in particular microorganisms, it is, e.g., possible to use an organism, in particular microorganism, expressing an enzyme as defined above. However, it is also conceivable to use an organism/microorganism expressing any possible combination of the above mentioned enzymes. Moreover, it is also possible to use a mixture of two or more types of organisms/microorganisms with one type expressing one enzyme and another expressing another enzyme. These different types can then be cocultivated.</p>
    <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The enzyme, e.g. the HMG CoA synthase and/or PksG protein and/or a C-C bond cleavage/condensation lyase, such as a HMG CoA lyase, employed in the process according to the present invention can be a natural version of the protein or a synthetic protein as well as a protein which has been chemically synthesized or produced in a biological system or by recombinant processes. The enzyme, e.g. the HMG CoA synthase and/or PksG protein and/or a C-C bond cleavage/condensation lyase, such as a HMG CoA lyase, may also be chemically modified, for example in order to improve its/their stability, resistance, e.g. to temperature, for facilitating its/their purification or its immobilization on a support. The enzyme/enzymes may be used in isolated form, purified form, in immobilized form, as a crude or partially purified extract obtained from cells synthesizing the enzyme/enzymes, as chemically synthesized enzyme(s), as recombinantly produced enzyme(s), in the form of microorganisms producing them etc.</p>
    <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The process according to the present invention may be carried out in vitro or in vivo. An in vitro reaction is understood to be a reaction in which no cells are employed, i.e. an acellular reaction.</p>
    <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">For carrying out the process in vitro the substrates for the reaction and the enzyme/enzymes are incubated under conditions (buffer, temperature, cofactors etc.) allowing the enzyme/enzymes to be active and the enzymatic conversion to occur. The reaction is allowed to proceed for a time sufficient to produce 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate. The production of 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate and/or 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyryl-CoA can be detected by comparison with standard compound after separation by thin-layer chromatography, LC/MS and colorimetric assay after its derivatization.</p>
    <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">The enzyme/enzymes may be in any suitable form allowing the enzymatic reaction to take place. It/they may be purified or partially purified or in the form of crude cellular extracts or partially purified extracts. It is also possible that the enzyme/enzymes is immobilized on a suitable carrier.</p>
    <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">Since the substrate acetone is in general shorter than the natural substrate used by the enzyme, e.g. acetoacetyl-CoA/acetoacetate used by HMG CoA synthase and HMG CoA lyase, respectively, it may be advantageous to add to the reaction mixture a cofactor which allows for a steric and/or electronic complementation in the catalytic site of the enzyme/enzymes. One example of such a cofactor, in the case of HMG CoA synthase, would be coenzyme A or a structurally closely related molecule such as S-nitroso-CoA.</p>
    <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">For carrying out the process in vivo use is made of a suitable organism/microorganism(s) which is/are capable of providing the substrates, i.e. acetone and a compound which provides an activated acetyl group as defined above, and an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the formation of a covalent bond between the carbon atom of the oxo (i.e. the C=O) group of acetone and the carbon atom (C<sup>2</sup>) corresponding to the methyl group of the compound which provides an activated acetyl group. In a preferred embodiment said enzyme is a HMG CoA synthase and/or PksG protein and/or a C-C bond cleavage/condensation lyase, such as a HMG CoA lyase.</p>
    <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">Thus, in the case of this embodiment the method according to the invention is characterised in that the conversion of acetone and a compound which provides an activated acetyl group is realized in the presence of an organism, preferably a microorganism capable of producing acetone and expressing an enzyme which is capable of the formation of a covalent bond between the carbon atom of the oxo (i.e. the C=O) group of acetone and the carbon atom (C<sup>2</sup>) corresponding to the methyl group of the compound which provides an activated acetyl group, preferably expressing an enzyme with the activity of a HMG CoA synthase (EC 2.3.3.10) and/or expressing a PksG protein and/or expressing an enzyme with the activity of a C-C bond cleavage/condensation lyase, such as a HMG CoA lyase (EC 4.1.3.4).</p>
    <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">The term "which is capable of producing acetone" in the context of the present invention means that the organism/microorganism has the capacity to produce acetone within the cell due to the presence of enzymes providing enzymatic activities allowing the production of acetone from metabolic precursors.</p>
    <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">Acetone is produced by certain microorganisms, such as Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium beijerinckii, Clostridium cellulolyticum, Bacillus polymyxa and Pseudomonas putida. The synthesis of acetone is best characterized in Clostridium acetobutylicum. It starts out with a reaction (reaction step 1) in which two molecules of acetyl-CoA are condensed into acetoacetyl-CoA. This reaction is catalyzed by acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.9). Acetoacetyl-CoA is then converted into acetoacetate by a reaction with acetic acid or butyric acid resulting also in the production of acetyl-CoA or butyryl-CoA (reaction step 2). This reaction is catalyzed e.g. by acetoacetylCoA transferase (EC 2.8.3.8). AcetoacetylCoA transferase is known from various organisms, e.g. from E. coli in which it is encoded by the atoAD gene or from Clostridium acetobutylicum in which it is encoded by the ctfAB gene. However, also other enzymes can catalyze this reaction, e.g. 3-oxoacid CoA transferase (EC 2.8.3.5) or succinate CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.5).</p>
    <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Finally, acetoacetate is converted into acetone by a decarboxylation step (reaction step 3) catalyzed by acetoacetate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.4).</p>
    <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">The above described reaction steps 1 and 2 and the enzymes catalyzing them are not characteristic for the acetone synthesis and can be found in various organism. In contrast, reaction step 3 which is catalyzed by acetoacetate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.4) is only found in those organisms which are capable of producing acetone.</p>
    <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">In one preferred embodiment the organism employed in the method according to the invention is an organism, preferably a microorganism, which naturally has the capacity to produce acetone. Thus, preferably the microorganism belongs to the genus Clostridium, Bacillus or Pseudomonas, more preferably to the species Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium beijerinckii, Clostridium cellulolyticum, Bacillus polymyxa or Pseudomonas putida.</p>
    <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">In a further preferred embodiment, the organism employed in the method according to the invention is an organism, preferably a microorganism, which naturally has the capacity to produce acetone and which is recombinant in the sense that it has further been genetically modified so as to express an enzyme as defined above. The term "recombinant" in one embodiment means that the organism is genetically modified so as to contain a foreign nucleic acid molecule encoding an enzyme as defined above. In a preferred embodiment the organism has been genetically modified so as to contain a foreign nucleic acid molecule encoding an enzyme as defined above, e.g. a HMG CoA synthase, a C-C bond cleavage/condensation lyase, such as a HMG CoA lyase, or a PksG protein or a foreign nucleic acid sequence encoding any possible combination of such proteins. The term "foreign" in this context means that the nucleic acid molecule does not naturally occur in said organism/microorganism. This means that it does not occur in the same structure or at the same location in the organism/microorganism. In one preferred embodiment, the foreign nucleic acid molecule is a recombinant molecule comprising a promoter and a coding sequence encoding the respective enzyme, e.g. a HMG CoA synthase and/or a C-C bond cleavage/condensation lyase, such as HMG CoA lyase, and/or a PksG protein, in which the promoter driving expression of the coding sequence is heterologous with respect to the coding sequence. Heterologous in this context means that the promoter is not the promoter naturally driving the expression of said coding sequence but is a promoter naturally driving expression of a different coding sequence, i.e., it is derived from another gene, or is a synthetic promoter or a chimeric promoter. Preferably, the promoter is a promoter heterologous to the organism/microorganism, i.e. a promoter which does not naturally occur in the respective organism/microorganism. Even more preferably, the promoter is an inducible promoter. Promoters for driving expression in different types of organisms, in particular in microorganisms, are well known to the person skilled in the art.</p>
    <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">In another preferred embodiment the nucleic acid molecule is foreign to the organism/microorganism in that the encoded enzyme(s), e.g. the HMG CoA synthase and/or the encoded C-C bond cleavage/condensation lyase, such as HMG CoA lyase, and/or PksG protein, is/are not endogenous to the organism/microorganism, i.e. are naturally not expressed by the organism/microorganism when it is not genetically modified. In other words, the encoded HMG CoA synthase and/or the encoded C-C bond cleavage/condensation lyase, such as HMG CoA lyase, and/or PksG protein is/are heterologous with respect to the organism/microorganism.</p>
    <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">The term "recombinant" in another embodiment means that the organism is genetically modified in the regulatory region controlling the expression of an enzyme as defined above which naturally occurs in the organism so as to lead to an increase in expression of the respective enzyme in comparison to a corresponding non-genetically modified organism. The meaning of the term high "higher expression" is described further below.</p>
    <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">Such a modification of a regulatory region can be achieved by methods known to the person skilled in the art. One example is to exchange the naturally occurring promoter by a promoter which allows for a higher expression or to modify the naturally occurring promoter so as to show a higher expression. Thus, in this embodiment the organism contains in the regulatory region of the gene encoding an enzyme as defined above a foreign nucleic acid molecule which naturally does not occur in the organism and which leads to a higher expression of the enzyme in comparison to a corresponding non-genetically modified organism.</p>
    <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">The foreign nucleic acid molecule may be present in the organism/microorganism in extrachromosomal form, e.g. as plasmid, or stably integrated in the chromosome. A stable integration is preferred.</p>
    <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">In a further preferred embodiment the organism/microorganism is characterized in that the expression/activity of an enzyme as defined above, e.g. of a HMG CoA synthase and/or a C-C bond cleavage/condensation lyase, such as HMG CoA lyase, and/or a PksG protein, is higher in the organism/microorganism genetically modified with the foreign nucleic acid molecule in comparison to the corresponding non-genetically modified organism/microorganism. A "higher" expression/activity means that the expression/activity of the enzyme, in particular of the HMG CoA synthase and/or a C-C bond cleavage/condensation lyase, such as HMG CoA lyase, and/or a PksG protein, in the genetically modified microorganism is at least 10%, preferably at least 20%, more preferably at least 30% or 50%, even more preferably at least 70% or 80% and particularly preferred at least 90% or 100% higher than in the corresponding non-genetically modified organism/microorganism. In even more preferred embodiments the increase in expression/activity may be at least 150%, at least 200% or at least 500%. In particularly preferred embodiments the expression is at least 10-fold, more preferably at least 100-fold and even more preferred at least 1000-fold higher than in the corresponding non-genetically modified organism/microorganism.</p>
    <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">The term "higher" expression/activity also covers the situation in which the corresponding non-genetically modified organism/microorganism does not express a corresponding enzyme, e.g. a HMG CoA synthase and/or a C-C bond cleavage/condensation lyase, such as a HMG CoA lyase, and/or a PksG protein, so that the corresponding expression/activity in the non-genetically modified organism/microorganism is zero.</p>
    <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">Methods for measuring the level of expression of a given protein in a cell are well known to the person skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the measurement of the level of expression is done by measuring the amount of the corresponding protein. Corresponding methods are well known to the person skilled in the art and include Western Blot, ELISA etc. In another embodiment the measurement of the level of expression is done by measuring the amount of the corresponding RNA. Corresponding methods are well known to the person skilled in the art and include, e.g., Northern Blot.</p>
    <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">Methods for measuring the enzymatic activity of the above-mentioned enzymes, in particular HMG CoA synthase and/or a C-C bond cleavage/condensation lyase, such as a HMG CoA lyase, and/or a PksG protein, respectively, are known in the art and have already been described above.</p>
    <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">In another preferred embodiment, the organism employed in the method according to the invention is a genetically modified organism, preferably a microorganism, derived from an organism/microorganism which naturally does not produce acetone but which has been genetically modified so as to produce acetone, i.e. by introducing the gene(s) necessary for allowing the production of acetone in the organism/microorganism. In principle any microorganism can be genetically modified in this way. The enzymes responsible for the synthesis of acetone have been described above. Genes encoding corresponding enzymes are known in the art and can be used to genetically modify a given microorganism so as to produce acetone.

    <p id="p-00144-en" num="0144">A panel of 12 HMG-CoA synthases and 8 HMG-CoA lyases were selected to create a non-redundant set of proteins aiming to represent the diversity of these enzyme classes as found across eukaryotic organisms. These proteins were identified by performing multiple sequence-based and text-based searches on the Universal Protein Resource Database Uniprot (http://www.uniprot.org/). They all contain unique features such as conserved protein domains and motifs characteristic to the enzyme class of interest. In order to effectively cover the sequence diversity without having to screen a large set of proteins, the initial pool of enzymes was narrowed down by grouping them into clusters of sequences with more than 85% homology and then selecting one single candidate sequence representative of each cluster. Protein sequence identity ranged from 30% to 80% and from 50% to 80% between any two proteins from the HMG-CoA synthases panel and the lyases panel respectively.</p>
    <p id="p-00145-en" num="0145">The same approach was applied to select the HMG-CoA synthases and HMG-CoA lyases from prokaryotic organisms. The created set contained 50 proteins homologues to HMG-CoA synthases, including pksG proteins, and 59 proteins homologues to HMG-CoA lyases.</p>
