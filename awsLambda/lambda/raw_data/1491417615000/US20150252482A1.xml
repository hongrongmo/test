      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention relate to a photochemical reaction device.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Reducing CO<sub>2 </sub>efficiently by light energy like plants has been required from the standpoint of energy problems and environmental concerns. Plants use a system called the Z-scheme to excite light energy in two stages. Using a photochemical reaction of this system, plants synthesize cellulose and sugar by obtaining electrons from water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and reducing carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">However, few technologies that can efficiently dissolve CO<sub>2 </sub>with electrons obtained from water through artificial photosynthesis without using any sacrificial reagent are available.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">A photochemical reaction device disclosed in JP-A-2011-094194, for example, has an oxidation reaction electrode for producing oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) by oxidizing H<sub>2</sub>O and a reduction reaction electrode for producing a carbon compound by reducing CO<sub>2</sub>. The oxidation reaction electrode has an oxidation catalyst for oxidizing H<sub>2</sub>O on a surface of a photocatalyst and gains potential with light energy. The reduction reaction electrode has a reduction catalyst for reducing CO<sub>2 </sub>on a surface of the photocatalyst and is connected to the oxidation reaction electrode with an electric wire. The reduction reaction electrode reduces CO<sub>2 </sub>to produce formic acid (HCOOH) by gaining reduction potential of CO<sub>2 </sub>from the oxidation reaction electrode. To gain the potential necessary for reducing CO<sub>2 </sub>using an optical wavelength and a photocatalyst, the photochemical reaction device thus employs a Z-scheme-type artificial photosynthesis system that imitates plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">However, JP-A-2011-094194, the solar energy conversion efficiency is very low at around 0.04%. This is because the energy efficiency of the photocatalyst excited by the optical wavelength is low. Because the reduction reaction electrode is connected with the oxidation reaction electrode with an electric wire, the efficiency in extracting electricity (electric current) decreases due to interconnection resistance, and, as a consequence, the efficiency becomes low.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">An device that has a configuration to produce a reaction by catalysts disposed on both sides of a silicon solar cell used for achieving the reaction potential is disclosed in JP-A-H10-290017. S. Y. Reece, et al., Science. vol. 334. pp. 645 (2011) describes an device which includes layered silicon solar cells for achieving the reaction potential and produces an electrolysis of H<sub>2</sub>O by disposing catalysts on both sides of the silicon solar cells. Both of these devices have a very high solar energy conversion efficiency of 2.5%.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">These devices are easily configured in a large size because they do not need to be hard-wired. They also have another feature in which a material partition process is not necessary because the cell itself plays a role of a divider plate to insulate materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">These devices, however, have not succeeded in the reduction reaction of CO<sub>2</sub>. Such plate-like laminate structure moreover does not take into consideration the fact that, for the CO<sub>2 </sub>reduction reaction, ions with a positive electric charge produced at the oxidation side and ions with a negative electric charge produced at the reduction side need to move to the opposite sides. In an oxidation-reduction reaction in which H<sub>2</sub>O is used as an electron donor instead of a sacrificial catalyst, in particular, proton (hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>)) movement is indispensable.</p>

      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In general, according to one embodiment, a photochemical reaction device comprises a laminated body, an ion transfer pathway, and an electrolytic tank. The laminated body comprises an oxidation catalyst layer for producing oxygen and protons by oxidizing water a reduction catalyst layer for producing carbon compounds by reducing carbon dioxide and a semiconductor layer formed between the oxidation catalyst layer and the reduction catalyst layer and developing charge separation with light energy. The ion transfer pathway is an opening penetrating the laminated body and moves ions between the oxidation catalyst layer side and the reduction catalyst layer side. The electrolytic tank includes the laminated body therein and comprising an oxidation reaction electrolytic tank disposed on the oxidation catalyst layer side and a reduction reaction electrolytic tank disposed on the reduction catalyst layer side separated by the laminated body. The area ratio of the opening in the laminated body is 40% or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Referring to the accompanying drawings, an embodiment according to the present embodiment will be described. In the drawings, like numbers indicate like parts throughout the views. A repetitive description will be done as necessary.</p>

      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a photoelectrochemicalcell of the embodiment will be described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a structure of a photoelectrochemicalcell of the embodiment;</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the photoelectrochemicalcell of the embodiment has a laminated body including a substrate <b>11</b>, a reflecting layer <b>12</b>, a reduction electrode layer <b>13</b>, a multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>, an oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b>, an oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b>, and a reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b>. On the front surface (light incidence surface) of the substrate <b>11</b>, the reflecting layer <b>12</b>, the reduction electrode layer <b>13</b>, the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>, the oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b>, and the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> are formed. On the back surface of the substrate <b>11</b>, the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> is formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The substrate <b>11</b> is disposed for the purpose of supporting the photoelectrochemicalcell and increasing its mechanical strength. The substrate <b>11</b> has conductivity and is a metal plate made of a metal such as Cu, Al, Ti, Ni, Fe, and Ag, or an alloy plate including at least one of such met als, e.g. SUS. The substrate <b>11</b> can be made from conductive resin or the like. The substrate <b>11</b> can also be made of a semiconductor substrate such as Si, Ge, etc. As described later, the substrate <b>11</b> can be made of an ion exchange membrane.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The reflecting layer <b>12</b> is formed on a surface of the substrate <b>11</b>. The reflecting layer <b>12</b> is made from a light reflective material such as a distributed Bragg reflecting layer including a metal layer or multi-layers of semiconductor materials. The reflecting layer <b>12</b>, by being disposed between the substrate <b>11</b> and the multi-junction photovoltaic cell, makes light not absorbed by the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> to be reflected and enter the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> again. Because of this configuration, the light absorption rate of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> can be improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The reduction electrode layer <b>13</b> is formed on the reflecting layer <b>12</b>. The reduction electrode layer <b>13</b> is formed on an n-type semiconductor layer (n-type amorphous silicon layer <b>14</b><i>a</i>, which will be described later) of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>. Thus, it is desirable that the reduction electrode layer <b>13</b> is made from a material by which the reduction electrode layer is able to have ohmic contact with the n-type semiconductor layer. The reduction electrode layer <b>13</b> is made from a metal such as Ag, Au, Al, and Cu or an alloy including at least one of them. The reduction electrode layer <b>13</b> can also be made from a transparent conductive oxidation material such as ITO (Indium Tin Oxide), zinc oxide (ZnO), FTO (Fluorine doped Tin Oxide), AZO (Antimony doped Zinc Oxide), and ATO (Antimony doped Tin Oxide). The reduction electrode layer <b>13</b> may have a stacked structure of a metal and a transparent conductive oxidation material, a composite structure of a metal and another type of conductive material, or a composite structure of a transparent conductive oxidation material and another type of conductive material.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> is formed on the reduction electrode layer <b>13</b> and includes a first photovoltaic cell <b>14</b>, a second photovoltaic cell <b>15</b>, and a third photovoltaic cell <b>16</b>. The first photovoltaic cell <b>14</b>, the second photovoltaic cell <b>15</b>, and the third photovoltaic cell <b>16</b> are photovoltaic cells which use a pin junction semiconductor and each cell has a different light absorption wavelength. With a layered structure of these photovoltaic cells, the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> is able to absorb solar light over a wide range of wavelengths and more efficient utilization of solar light energy becomes possible. A high open circuit voltage is also obtainable due to series connection of the photovoltaic cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">More specifically, the first photovoltaic cell <b>14</b> includes an n-type amorphous silicon (a-Si) layer <b>14</b><i>a</i>, an intrinsic amorphous silicon germanium (a-SiGe) layer <b>14</b><i>b</i>, and a p-type microcrystal silicon (pc-Si) layer <b>14</b><i>c</i>, stacked from the bottom in this order. The a-SiGe layer <b>14</b><i>b </i>is a layer that absorbs light in a short wavelength range around 400 nm. That is, the first photovoltaic cell <b>14</b> develops charge separation with light energy in the short wavelength range.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The second photovoltaic cell <b>15</b> includes an n-type a-Si layer <b>15</b><i>a</i>, an intrinsic a-SiGe layer <b>15</b><i>b</i>, and a p-type pc-Si layer <b>15</b><i>c</i>, stacked from the bottom in this order. The a-SiGe layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>is a layer that absorbs light in a medium wavelength range of around 600 nm. That is, the second photovoltaic cell <b>15</b> develops charge separation with light energy in the medium wavelength range.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The third photovoltaic cell <b>16</b> includes an n-type a-Si layer <b>16</b><i>a</i>, an intrinsic a-SiGe layer <b>16</b><i>b</i>, and a p-type pc-Si layer <b>16</b><i>c</i>, stacked from the bottom in this order. The a-Si layer <b>16</b><i>b </i>is a layer that absorbs light in a long wavelength range of around 700 nm. That is, the third photovoltaic cell <b>16</b> develops charge separation with light energy in the long wavelength range.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">As described above, the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> is able to develop charge separation with light of any wavelength. That is, holes move to a positive side (front surface side) and electrons move to a negative side (back surface side). This charge separation causes the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> to produce photovoltaic power.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Although the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> configured with a laminate structure of three photovoltaic cells is described above, the configuration of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell is not limited to this type. The multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> may include a laminate structure of two or more than four photovoltaic cells. One photovoltaic cell can be used instead of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>. Although a photovoltaic cell using a pin junction semiconductor is described above, a photovoltaic cell using a pn junction semiconductor can be used instead. Although the semiconductor layer is made from Si and Ge in the above example, the material is not limited to them; it can also be made from a compound semiconductor such as GaAs, GaInP, AlGaInP, CdTe, and CuInGaSe. Furthermore, a variety of forms such as a single crystal, a polycrystal, and an amorphous form can be applied.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b> is formed on the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>. The oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b> is formed on the p-type semiconductor layer (p-type pc-Si layer <b>16</b><i>c</i>) of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>. It is therefore desirable that the oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b> is made from a material which is able to have ohmic contact with the p-type semiconductor layer. The oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b> is made from a metal such as Ag, Au, Al, and Cu or an alloy including at least one of them. The oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b> can also be made from a transparent conductive oxidation material such as ITO, ZnO, FTO, AZO, and ATO. The oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b> may have a laminated structure of a metal and a transparent conductive oxidation material, a composite structure of a metal and another type of conductive material, or a composite structure of a transparent conductive oxidation material and another type of conductive material.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In this embodiment, irradiated light reaches the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> passing through the oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b>. The oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b> disposed on the light-irradiation side therefore has a light transmission property for irradiated light. More specifically, the light transmission rate of the oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b> on the light-irradiation side needs to be at least 10% or more, more preferably 30% or more, of an amount of irradiated light.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> is formed on the oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b>. The oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> is formed on the positive side of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> and produces O<sub>2 </sub>and H<sup>+</sup> by oxidizing H<sub>2</sub>O. The oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> is therefore made from a material which decreases the activation energy for oxidizing H<sub>2</sub>O. In other words, the oxidation catalyst layer is made from a material which lowers the overvoltage when producing O<sub>2 </sub>and H<sup>+</sup> by oxidizing H<sub>2</sub>O. Such materials include binary metallic oxides such as Manganese oxide (MnâO), Iridium oxide (IrâO), Nickel oxide (NiâO), Cobalt oxide (CoâO), Iron oxide (FeâO), Tin oxide (SnâO), Indium oxide (InâO), and Ruthenium oxide (RuâO), ternary metallic oxides such as NiâCoâO, LaâCoâO, NiâLaâO, and SrâFeâO, quarternary metallic oxides such as PbâRuâIrâO and LaâSrâCoâO, or a metal complex such as an Ru complex and an Fe complex. The configuration of the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> is not limited to a film; the oxidation catalyst layer may be configured to be a grid, particulate, or wired structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In this embodiment, irradiated light reaches the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> passing through the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> as well as the oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b>. The oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> disposed on the light-irradiation side therefore has a light transmission property for irradiated light. More specifically, the light transmission rate of the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> on the light-irradiation side needs to be at least 10% or more, more preferably 30% or more, of an amount of irradiated light.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> is formed on the back surface of the substrate <b>11</b>. The reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> is formed on the negative side of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> and produces a carbon compound (e.g., carbon monoxide (CO), formic acid (HCOOH), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH), or ethanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH)) by reducing CO<sub>2</sub>. The reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> is therefore made from a material which decreases the activation energy for reducing CO<sub>2</sub>. In other words, the reduction catalyst layer is made from a material which lowers the overvoltage when producing a carbon compound by reducing CO<sub>2</sub>. Such materials include a metal such as Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Ni, Zn, C, graphene, CNT (carbon nanotube), fullerene, Ketjen black, and Pd or an alloy including at least one of them or a metal complex such as an Ru complex and an Re complex. The configuration of the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> is not limited to a film; the reduction catalyst layer may be configured to be a grid, particulate, or wired structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The substrate <b>11</b> can be positioned on any of the positive side and negative side of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>. Although the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> is disposed on the light incidence surface in this embodiment, the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> can be disposed on the light incidence surface. That is, in the photoelectrochemicalcell, the positions of the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> and the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b>, the positions of the oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b> and the reduction electrode layer <b>13</b>, and the polarities of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell are interchangeable. If such an interchange is applied, it is desirable that the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> and the reduction electrode layer <b>13</b> have transparency.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">A passivation layer may also be disposed on the front surface of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> or between an electrode layer and a catalyst layer on the light-irradiation side (between the oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b> and the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> in this embodiment). The passivation layer has conductivity and prevents the multi-junction photovoltaic cell from corroding in an oxidation-reduction reaction as well. Such a feature of the passivation layer extends the battery life of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>. The passivation layer also has a light transmission property when needed. The passivation layer can be a dielectric thin film such as TiO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, and HfO<sub>2</sub>. The thickness needs to be desirably 10 nm or less, more preferably 5 nm or less, to have conductivity via the tunnel effect.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing an operating principle of the photoelectrochemicalcell of the embodiment. In <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the reflecting layer <b>12</b>, the reduction electrode layer <b>13</b>, and the oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b> are not shown.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, light entering on the front side passes through the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> and the oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b> and reaches the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>. The multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>, if it absorbs light, produces photoexcited electrons and their pairing holes and separates them. That is, in each photovoltaic cell (the first photovoltaic cell <b>14</b>, the second photovoltaic cell <b>15</b>, and the third photovoltaic cell <b>16</b>), charge separation in which photoexcited electrons move to the n-type semiconductor layer side (the side facing the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b>) and holes pairing with the photoexcited electrons move to the p-type semiconductor layer (the side facing the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b>) takes place. This charge separation causes the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> to produce photovoltaic power.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">As described above, photoexcited electrons created inside the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> are used for the reduction reaction in the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b>, which is an anode, and holes are used for the oxidation reaction in the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b>, which is a cathode. Accordingly, a reaction according to the formula (1) takes place in the vicinity of the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> and a reaction according to the formula (2) takes place in the vicinity of the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b>.</p>

      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0061">As shown in the formula (1), H<sub>2</sub>O is oxidized (losing an electron) and O<sub>2 </sub>and H<sup>+</sup> are produced in the vicinity of the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b>. H<sup>+</sup> produced on the side where the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> exists moves to the side where the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> exists through an ion transfer pathway, which will be described later.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0062">As shown in the formula (2), in the vicinity of the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b>, a reaction between CO<sub>2 </sub>and H<sup>+</sup>, which has moved there, takes place and carbon monoxide (CO) and H<sub>2</sub>O are produced. That is, CO<sub>2 </sub>is reduced (attaining an electron).</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0063">In this process, the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> need to have an open circuit voltage equal to or higher than the potential difference between the standard oxidation reduction potential of an oxidation reaction taking place in the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> and the standard oxidation reduction potential of a reduction reaction taking place in the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b>. For example, the standard oxidation reduction potential of the oxidation reaction in the formula (1) is 1.23 [V] and the standard oxidation reduction potential of the reduction reaction in the formula (2) is â0.1 m. The open circuit voltage of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> thus needs to be equal to or higher than 1.33 [V]. More preferably, the open circuit voltage needs to be equal to or higher than the potential difference including the overvoltage. More specifically, in the case that the overvoltage in an oxidation reaction according to the formula (1) and the overvoltage in a reduction reaction according to the formula (2) are both 0.2 [V], the open circuit voltage needs to be equal to or higher than 1.73 m.</p>

Such an electrolytic solution includes an ionic liquid, which is made of salt of a cation such as an imidazolium ion or a pyridinium ion and an anion such as BF<sub>4</sub><sup>â</sup> and PF<sub>6</sub><sup>â</sup> and is in a liquid state in a wide temperature range, or its aqueous solution. An amine solution such as ethanoleamine, imidazole, and pyridine or its aqueous solution can also be used as an electrolytic solution. Any of a primary amine, secondary amine, tertiary amine or quaternary amine can be used. A primary amine may be a methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, butylamine, pentylamine, and hexylamine. A hydrocarbon in an amine can be replaced with an alcohol, halogen, or the like.

In the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>46</b>, carbon compounds are produced through the reduction of CO<sub>2 </sub>by the reduction reaction layer <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0074">Temperatures of the electrolytic solutions filling the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>45</b> and the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>46</b> may take the same value or different values depending on their usage environment. If the electrolytic solution used for the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>46</b> is an amine absorbing solution which includes CO<sub>2 </sub>emitted from a factory, for example, the temperature of the electrolytic solution is higher than the atmospheric temperature. In this case, the electrolytic solution temperature needs to be 30Â° C. or higher and 150Â° C. or lower, more preferably 40Â° C. or higher and 120Â° C. or lower.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0075">The electrolytic tank flow path <b>41</b> is disposed, for example, side of the electrolytic tank <b>31</b>. One end of the electrolytic tank flow path <b>41</b> is connected to the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>45</b> and the other end is connected to the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>46</b>. That is, the electrolytic tank flow path <b>41</b> connects the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>45</b> with the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>46</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0076">An ion exchange membrane <b>43</b> is disposed (filled) in a portion of the electrolytic tank flow path <b>41</b> and allows a particular type of ion to pass through. By this structure, the electrolytic solution of the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>45</b> can be separated from the electrolytic solution of the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>46</b>, and only a particular type of ion can be moved through the electrolytic tank flow path <b>41</b> equipped with the ion exchange membrane <b>43</b>. That is, the photochemical reaction device has a diaphragm structure that selectively allows substances to pass through. The ion exchange membrane <b>43</b> in the above structure is a proton exchange membrane and is able to make H<sup>+</sup> produced in the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>45</b> move to the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>46</b>. More specifically, the types of the ion exchange membrane <b>43</b> include a cation exchange membrane such as Nafion and Flemion and an anion exchange membrane such as Neosepta and Selemion.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0077">Another substance that can make ions move and separate electrolytic solutions, e.g., an agar such as salt bridge, can be used instead of the ion exchange membrane <b>43</b>. By using a solid polymer membrane, which has proton exchangeability and is represented by Nafion, in general, a high ion movability can be attained.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0078">The electrolytic tank flow path <b>41</b> may be equipped with a circulation mechanism <b>42</b> such as a pump. With the mechanism, ion (H<sup>+</sup>) circulation between the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>45</b> and the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>46</b> can be improved. Two electrolytic tank flow paths <b>41</b> may be disposed and, by using the circulation mechanism <b>42</b> attached to at least one of these electrolytic tank flow paths, ions may be moved from the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>45</b> to the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>46</b> via one of the electrolytic tank flow paths <b>41</b> and from the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>46</b> to the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>45</b> via the other electrolytic tank flow path <b>41</b>. A plurality of circulation mechanisms <b>42</b> may also be attached. In order to reduce diffusion of ions and circulate ions with higher efficiency, a plurality (three or more) of electrolytic tank flow paths <b>41</b> may be arranged. Making the liquid flow smoothly may also cause bubbles of created gas not to stay on a surface of the electrode and electrolytic layer and thus reduction in efficiency or light amount distribution caused by sunlight scattering due to the bubbles to be controlled. The liquid may be moved in either direction.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0079">Producing a temperature difference between the electrolytic liquids using raised heat by radiating light on a surface of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> may make ion diffusion decrease and ions circulate with improved efficiency. In other words, ion movement can be accelerated by convection other than ion diffusion. If the electrolytic solution used for the reduction reaction electrolytic bath <b>46</b> is an amine absorbing solution which includes CO<sub>2 </sub>emitted from a factory, for example, the temperature of the electrolytic solution is higher than atmosphere temperature. In this case, there is a difference in temperature between the electrolytic solution in the reduction reaction electrolytic bath <b>46</b> and the electrolytic solution in the oxidation reaction electrolytic bath <b>45</b>. As a result, the ion movement can be accelerated.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0080">Photovoltaic cell performance and catalyst performance can be controlled by disposing a temperature adjustment mechanism <b>44</b>, which executes temperature control for electrolytic solutions, in the electrolytic tank flow path <b>41</b> and electrolytic tank <b>31</b> and executing temperature control with the mechanism. This arrangement can, for example, homogenize a temperature of the reaction system in order to stabilize and improve the performance of the photovoltaic cell and catalyst. Temperature rise can also be prevented for system stabilization. Temperature control may alter the selectivity of the photovoltaic cell and catalyst and also control materials from them.</p>

      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0112">One of the methods to form the through-hole <b>52</b> is, for example, etching after forming a mask pattern. More specifically, after forming a mask pattern on the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> (on the front surface) or the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> (on the back surface), the substrate <b>11</b>, the reflecting layer <b>12</b>, the reduction electrode layer <b>13</b>, the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>, the oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b>, the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b>, and the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> are etched using the mask pattern.</p>

The methods of etching include a dry etching method using a reactive gas such as a chlorine-based gas or a wet etching method using an acid solution or an alkaline solution. A direct processing method such as laser beam machining, press working, and cutting is useful in the sense that it has an advantage in the small number of process steps.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0114">The through-hole <b>52</b> is thus formed in the substrate <b>11</b>, the reflecting layer <b>12</b>, the reduction electrode layer <b>13</b>, the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>, the oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b>, the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b>, and the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b>.

      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="1">Effect of First Embodiment</heading>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0115">According to the first embodiment described above, the photochemical reaction device has a photoelectrochemicalcell configured in a laminated body of the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b>, the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b>, and the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> disposed therebetween and the ion transfer pathway through which ions (H<sup>+</sup>) are moved between the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> and the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b>. With this configuration, H<sup>+</sup> produced in the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> can be transferred to the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> through the ion transfer pathway. As a result, a high photoreduction efficiency (solar energy conversion efficiency) can be achieved by accelerating a reductive decomposition of CO<sub>2 </sub>in the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0116">The energy (potential) necessary for the oxidation of H<sub>2</sub>O in the vicinity of the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> and the reduction of CO<sub>2 </sub>in the vicinity of the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> is provided by the photovoltaic power produced in the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>. To let light enter, a transparent electrode is generally used for an electrode which is provided in order to collect photoexcited electrons produced in charge separation in the photovoltaic cell of the comparative example. However, because a transparent electrode has a high resistance, the efficiency in collecting electricity may be reduced. Thus, metal wirings which have no transparency are connected to the transparent electrode as an auxiliary electrode in some cases. In that case, however, because irradiance decreases due to cutting-off of incoming light by the metal wirings, the efficiency is further reduced. Furthermore, because the metal wirings are usually formed in long and slim shapes, the resistance of the electrode in collecting electricity (electrons) via the metal wirings increases.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0117">In the first embodiment, the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> and the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b>, both being flat plate-shaped, are disposed on the front surface and the back surface of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>, respectively. Due to this arrangement, an oxidation-reduction reaction takes place by the catalysts instantly after the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> produces charge separation. In other words, charge separation takes place at the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> and an oxidation-reduction reaction takes place at the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> and the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b>. Due to this arrangement, photovoltaic power produced by the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> can efficiently be applied to the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> and the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> without increasing the resistance caused by metal wirings. Simplification of a structure can also be achieved because forming metal wirings or the like is not necessary.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0118">In a case in which electricity is collected from the photovoltaic cell via metal wirings in the comparative example, the complexity of a structure leads to areas being enlarged. Thus, the area of an electrode needs to be reduced in order to secure a small size. As a result, reaction with high current density is necessary. In this case, because a high performance catalyst that can accelerate a reaction with high current density is limited, a precious metal is often used.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0119">In the first embodiment, the area of a portion other than the electrode is not necessary because of a laminate structure of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>, the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b>, and the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b>. Thus, both a small size and an enlarged electrode area can be achieved simultaneously and reaction with a relatively low current density is possible. With this configuration, a general purpose metal can be used due to a wide range of alternatives for a catalytic metal. It is also easy to secure reaction selectivity.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0120">The CO<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction efficiency for a case in which the through-hole <b>52</b> is formed as an ion transfer pathway in the first embodiment will be described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0121">
        <figref>FIG. 12</figref> is a table of an experimental result showing CO<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction efficiency in an example 1 in comparison with a comparative example. More specifically, the table shows CO<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction efficiencies for example 1 (1-1 to 1-12), all in relative values scaled to the CO<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction efficiency for the comparative example, which is assumed to be 1.00. Details of <figref>FIG. 12</figref> will be described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0122">Example 1 is an example of the photoelectrochemicalcell in the photochemical reaction device of the first embodiment. More specifically, the photoelectrochemicalcell of example 1 has the through-hole <b>52</b> through which only H<sup>+</sup> can be moved and the equivalent circle diameter of which is relatively large. In example 1, twelve photoelectrochemicalcells (sample cell numbers 1-1 to 1-12), the through-holes <b>52</b> of which have equivalent circle diameters of 50, 100, and 200 Î¼m and area ratios of 10, 20, 30, and 40%, were produced and their CO<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction efficiencies were evaluated. These photoelectrochemicalcells in example 1 were produced as described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0123">First, a structure that has the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> including a pin-type a-Si layer, a-SiGe layer, and a-SiGe layer, the oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b> made from ITO and formed on the front surface of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>, the reduction electrode layer <b>13</b> made from ZnO and formed on the front surface of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>, the reflecting layer <b>12</b> made from Ag and formed on the back surface of the reduction electrode layer <b>13</b>, and the SUS substrate <b>11</b> formed on the back surface of the reflecting layer <b>12</b> is prepared. In this configuration, the thickness of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> is 500 nm, the thickness of the oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b> is 100 nm, the thickness of the reduction electrode layer <b>13</b> is 300 nm, the thickness of the reflecting layer <b>12</b> is 200 nm, and the thickness of the SUS substrate is 1.5 mm. The oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> is disposed on the p-type surface of the multi-junction semiconductor and the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> is disposed on the n-type surface of the multi-junction semiconductor.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0124">Next, the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> made from Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>is formed on the front surface of the oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b> by a sputtering method. On the back surface of the SUS substrate <b>11</b>, the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> made from Au is formed with a vacuum evaporation method. In this process, the thickness of the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> is 100 nm and the thickness of the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> is 100 nm.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0125">A laminated body (cell) of the substrate <b>11</b>, the reflecting layer <b>12</b>, the reduction electrode layer <b>13</b>, the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>, the oxidation electrode layer <b>18</b>, the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b>, and the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> is thus formed. Next, light is irradiated on the laminated body from the side facing the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> by a solar simulator (AM1.5, 1000 W/m<sup>2</sup>) and the open circuit voltage of the cell at the irradiation is measured. Based on the measurement, the open circuit voltage of the cell is set to 1.9 [V].</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0126">Next, the through-hole <b>52</b> is formed in the cell. The through-hole <b>52</b> is formed by irradiating a laser beam on the prepared cell. Laser beam irradiation parameters are as follows: wavelength of 515 nm; pulse width of 15 ps; and repetition frequency of 82 MHz. The laser beam is concentrated with an object lens of 10-fold magnification and irradiated on the cell. With this process, a plurality of through-holes <b>52</b> in an arrangement of a triangular lattice is formed in the cell. Next, each through-hole <b>52</b> is trimmed using a laser beam again so as to be perpendicular.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0127">Next, the cell to which the through-hole <b>52</b> is formed is cut into a square shape and the edges of the cell are sealed with epoxy resin so that the area of the exposed part is 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. Then, an image of the cell is taken with an optical microscope or scanning electron microscope from an angle of view such that about one hundred through-holes <b>52</b> are captured and the equivalent circle diameter and area ratio of the through-hole <b>52</b> of each cell are measured with image processing software. By the above process, the photoelectrochemicalcells (sample cell numbers 1-1 to 1-12) of example 1 were produced.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0128">In contrast, the photoelectrochemicalcell of the comparative example is a photoelectrochemicalcell that has no through-hole <b>52</b> and has the same structure as the cell of example 1 except the through-hole <b>52</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0129">The CO<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction efficiency was measured by a method to be described below. First, the cell was dipped in a closed-system tank (electrolytic tank <b>31</b>) which contained a solution of 0.1 M (mol/l) KHCO<sub>3 </sub>produced by bubbling CO<sub>2 </sub>gas for ten minutes. Next, light was irradiated on the cell from the side where the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> exists by a solar simulator (AM1.5, 1000 W/m<sup>2</sup>) for ten minutes. Then, a quantitative analysis of gas contained in the tank was conducted by gas chromatogram mass spectrometry (GCMS). The result of the analysis shows detected gases are O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, and CO. The CO gas is produced by CO<sub>2 </sub>reduction. CO<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction efficiencies are calculated from CO quantities measured for the sample cells in example 1 and shown in relative values scaled to the CO quantity produced for the cell of the comparative example, which is assumed to be 1.00.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0130">As shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, the smaller the area ratio of the through-holes <b>52</b> are, the higher CO<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction efficiencies can be attained compared to the comparative example, if the equivalent circle diameters of the through-holes <b>52</b> are the same in example 1. More specifically, regardless of the equivalent circle diameter of the through-hole <b>52</b>, a high CO<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction efficiency can be attained if the area ratio of the through-hole <b>52</b> is 10, 20, or 30%. This is a result of minimizing the area ratio of the through-hole <b>52</b>. That is, this is a result of achieving an efficiency increase by H<sup>+</sup> transfer improvement and avoiding an efficiency decrease caused by light absorption loss by controlling the area decrease of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>. For the cases with the area ratio of 40% or more, however, the achieved photoreduction efficiencies are less than that of the comparative example because the efficiency decrease caused by light absorption loss outweighs the efficiency increase by H<sup>+</sup> transfer improvement. From the result of example 1, it can be said that the area ratio of the through-hole <b>52</b> needs to be 40% or less, more preferably 10% or less. However, this area ratio do not apply to cases in which light diffraction effect or scattering effect is available, as described for a second embodiment later.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0131">In example 1, the larger the equivalent circle diameter of the through-holes <b>52</b>, the higher the CO<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction efficiency attained, compared to the comparative example, if the area ratios of the through-holes <b>52</b> are the same. This is because a structure including a through-hole <b>52</b> with a large equivalent circle diameter can have a large processing range (processing area) per unit area, and the effect of damage caused by the processing can be reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0132">As described above, in the first embodiment, higher CO<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction efficiencies compared with the comparative example can be attained by adjusting both the equivalent circle diameter and area ratio of the through-hole <b>52</b> for the cases in which the through-hole <b>52</b> is formed as an ion transfer pathway.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="1">2-2. Second Embodiment</heading>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0133">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 13 to 19</figref>, a photochemical reaction device of a second embodiment will be described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0134">According to the experimental result shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, CO<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction efficiency for a case in which the through-hole <b>52</b> is formed as an ion transfer pathway is determined mainly by not only the H<sup>+</sup> transfer efficiency but also the light absorption amount by the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>. This is because, if the through-hole <b>52</b> is formed in the photoelectrochemicalcell, the area of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> decreases, which leads to a reduction in the light absorption amount. As a result, the number of electrons and holes created by light decreases and the decrease leads to a reduction in reaction efficiency of the oxidation-reduction reaction. Suppression of light absorption loss at the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> caused by forming the through-hole <b>52</b> is thus needed.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0135">The second embodiment is an example in which the light absorption loss associated with the decrease in the area of the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> is suppressed by adjusting the size, shape, or structure of the through-hole <b>52</b>. The second embodiment will be described in detail below. In the description of the second embodiment, description of the same or similar features as the first embodiment will be omitted and only differences will be described.</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="1">Structure of Second Embodiment</heading>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0136">A structure of a photochemical reaction device of the second embodiment will be described first below.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0137">
        <figref>FIG. 13</figref> is a cross-sectional view, taken along the line A-A in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, showing a structure of a photochemical reaction device of the second embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0138">As shown in <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, one of the differences between first embodiment and the second embodiment is that sizes of the through-holes <b>52</b> are precisely defined. More specifically, a pitch w<b>1</b> of the through-hole <b>52</b> is 3 Î¼m or less, or an equivalent circle diameter w<b>2</b> of the through-hole <b>52</b> is 1 Î¼m or less. That is, the through-hole <b>52</b> in the second embodiment is formed comparatively finely. Reasons for this will be described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0139">
        <figref>FIG. 14</figref> is a graph showing a relation between the pitch w<b>1</b> of the through-holes <b>52</b> and a light absorption rate by a multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> in the photochemical reaction device of the second embodiment. <figref>FIG. 15</figref> is a graph showing a relation between the equivalent circle diameter w<b>2</b> of the through-holes <b>52</b> and the light absorption rate by the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> in the photochemical reaction device of the second embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0140">In <figref>FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, the sunlight absorption amount measured by RCWA (Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis) is shown for a case in which a plurality of the through-holes <b>52</b> are arranged in a square lattice in an a-Si layer with a thickness of 550 nm. More specifically, a light absorption rate Î±(Î») for incident light perpendicularly entering the surface of the sample and with a wavelength of 300 nm to 1000 nm is calculated using Diffract MD (manufactured by Rsoft) and the sunlight absorption amount A=Î£Î±(Î»)ÃI(Î») is calculated by multiplying sunlight spectrum I(Î») by the light absorption rate. <figref>FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> show the sunlight absorption amounts in relative values scaled to a sunlight absorption amount of an photochemical reaction device including no through-hole <b>52</b> (hereinafter, a comparative example), which is assumed to be 1. The computing is done for the cases in which the area ratios of the through-hole <b>52</b> are 9, 30, 50, and 70%.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0141">As shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, the light absorption rate decreases (to 1 or less) compared with the comparative example as the pitch w<b>1</b> of the through-hole <b>52</b> increases. Similarly, as shown in <figref>FIG. 15</figref>, the light absorption rate decreases compared with the comparative example as the equivalent circle diameter w<b>2</b> of the through-hole <b>52</b> increases. This is because the light absorption amount decreases by the volume of the through-hole <b>52</b> due to a geometrical interaction between incident light and through-hole structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0142">However, if the pitch w<b>1</b> is 3 Î¼m or less or the equivalent circle diameter w<b>2</b> is 1 Î¼m, there is no decrease in the absorption amount compared with the comparative example and a high absorption amount can be achieved. This is because incident light is diffracted and scattered in the a-Si layer by the formed through-hole structure. That is, this is because, by diffraction and scattering, the incident light enters the a-Si layer, its optical path length is lengthened, and the light absorption amount by the a-Si layer increases.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0143">Though a plurality of the through-holes <b>52</b> arranged in a square lattice is described above, using a triangular arrangement leads to a similar result. The planar shape of the through-hole <b>52</b> is not limited to a circular shape. It may be elliptical, triangular, or square. The planar shape of the through-hole <b>52</b> need neither be a regular shape nor in a regular arrangement. If it has a structure with a cycle and fluctuation in diameters, a diffraction effect is attainable. Even if it has a random structure, the light absorption amount can be increased due to a light scattering effect.</p>

      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0175">The CO<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction efficiency was measured by a method to be described below. First, the cell was dipped in a closed-system tank (electrolytic tank <b>31</b>) which contained a solution of 0.1 M (mol/l) KHCO<sub>3 </sub>produced by bubbling CO<sub>2 </sub>gas for ten minutes. Next, light was irradiated on the cell from the side where the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> exists by a solar simulator (AM1.5, 1000 W/m<sup>2</sup>) for ten minutes. Then, a quantitative analysis of gas contained in the tank was conducted by gas chromatogram mass spectrometry (GCMS). The result of the analysis shows that detected gases are O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, and CO. The CO gas is produced by CO<sub>2 </sub>reduction. CO<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction efficiencies are calculated from CO quantities measured for the sample cells in example 2 and shown in relative values scaled to the CO quantity produced for the cell of the comparative example, which is assumed as 1.00.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0176">As shown in <figref>FIG. 17</figref>, in example 2, if the equivalent circle diameter is 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 Î¼m, a high CO<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction efficiency can be achieved compared with the comparative example. This is because not only an efficiency increase by H<sup>+</sup> transfer improvement is achieved but also the light absorption amount by the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> is increased through the diffraction and scattering of incident light caused by a relatively shortened equivalent circle diameter. In particular, a higher CO<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction efficiency can be attained for the case of sample cell number 2-2 (with the equivalent circle diameter of 0.5 Î¼m). However, if the equivalent circle diameter is 2.0 Î¼m, the diffraction effect diminishes and an attainable advantage is smaller than the comparative example.</p>

With such GI effect, an antireflection effect, by which a light reflection component created upon light incidence is suppressed, can be attained. That is, because more light enters the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>, it is possible to absorb more light. An improvement of 10 to 15% over the photoreduction efficiency achieved by the cells in example 2 due to the antireflection effect is indicated in the result of a photoreduction efficiency measurement, which is conducted under the same conditions as in example 2.</p>
      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0207">As shown in <figref>FIG. 23</figref>, a passivation layer <b>61</b> is formed on the interior surface of the through-hole <b>52</b> in the variation 2 of the photochemical reaction device of the second embodiment. In other words, the passivation layer <b>61</b> is formed on sidewalls of the substrate <b>11</b>, multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>, oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b>, and reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> inside the through-hole <b>52</b>. The passivation layer <b>61</b> is made of a dielectric (insulator) thin film such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and HfO<sub>2</sub>. The thickness of the passivation layer <b>61</b> is, for example, around 30 nm.</p>
      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0208">The passivation layer <b>61</b> is formed on the interior surface of the through-hole <b>52</b> and on the resist by ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition) or CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) after the etching process by ICP-RIE and before the removal of the resist over the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b>. Thus, by removing the passivation layer <b>61</b> over the resist and the resist, the passivation layer <b>61</b> is formed only on the interior surface of the through-hole <b>52</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0209">A method for forming the passivation layer <b>61</b> is not limited to the ALD or CVD method. The dipping method, which includes dipping of a cell into a solution including metallic ions and heat treatment, is also effective.</p>
      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0210">By forming the passivation layer <b>61</b> as a sidewall of the through-hole <b>52</b>, it becomes possible to suppress the leakage of electrons and holes from the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> and prevent the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b> from being corroded by a solution. An improvement of 5 to 10% over the photoreduction efficiency achieved by the cells of example 2 due to the leakage prevention is indicated in the result of a photoreduction efficiency measurement, which is conducted under the same conditions as in example 2.</p>

      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0211">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 24 to 27</figref>, a photochemical reaction device of a third embodiment will be described below. A photochemical reaction device of the third embodiment is an example in which a photoelectrochemicalcell is applied to a tubular (pipe-like) piping. With this structure, it becomes possible to resolve CO<sub>2</sub>, to easily transfer chemical compounds produced in the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> and the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b>, and to use the compounds as chemical energy. The third embodiment will be described in detail below. In the description of the third embodiment, description of the same or similar features as the photochemical reaction device of the first embodiment will be omitted and only differences will be described.</p>
      <heading id="h-00019-en" level="1">Structure of Third Embodiment</heading>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0212">A structure of a photochemical reaction device of the third embodiment will be described first below.</p>

In <figref>FIG. 24</figref>, an ion transfer pathway is not shown.</p>
      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0214">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>, in the photochemical reaction device of the third embodiment, a piping <b>101</b> is used as an electrolytic tank <b>31</b>. The photovoltaic reaction device of the third embodiment has a photoelectrochemicalcell, a piping <b>101</b> including (containing) the photoelectrochemicalcell therein, and an opening <b>51</b> formed in a substrate <b>11</b>, a multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>, an oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b>, and a reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> as an ion transfer pathway. In this description, a âpipingâ means a system of tubes or pipes for leading a fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0215">The photoelectrochemicalcell is formed in a cylindrical (tubular) shape the outer surface of which is the light-irradiation side (the side where the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> exists). That is, the photoelectrochemicalcell has a tubular structure to which the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b>, the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>, the substrate <b>11</b>, and the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> are formed from the outer side in this order. This tubular structure divides the piping <b>101</b> into two parts along a flow direction. The tubular photoelectrochemicalcell and the tubular piping <b>101</b> need not have the same central axis. In other words, their cross sections need not be concentric. With this arrangement, the piping <b>101</b> has an oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>102</b> on the outer side, to which the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> of the photoelectrochemicalcell is disposed, and a reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>103</b> on the inner side, to which the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> of the photoelectrochemicalcell is disposed. The oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>102</b> and the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>103</b> can be provided with different electrolytic solutions. The photoelectrochemicalcell may have a reversed structure, i.e., the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b>, the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>, the substrate <b>11</b>, and the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b> are formed from the outer side in this order. In this case, the positions of the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>102</b> and the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>103</b> are also reversed.</p>
      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0216">The oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>102</b> is filled with an electrolytic solution, e.g., a liquid including H<sub>2</sub>O. In the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>102</b>, O<sub>2 </sub>and H<sup>+</sup> are produced through the oxidation of H<sub>2</sub>O by the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0217">The reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>103</b> is filled with an electrolytic solution, e.g., liquid including CO<sub>2</sub>. In the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>103</b>, carbon compounds are produced through the reduction of CO<sub>2 </sub>by the reduction reaction layer <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0218">The opening <b>51</b> is formed so as to penetrate the substrate <b>11</b>, the multi-junction photovoltaic cell <b>17</b>, the oxidation catalyst layer <b>19</b>, and the reduction catalyst layer <b>20</b> from the side facing the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>102</b> to the side facing the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>103</b>. With this arrangement, the opening <b>51</b> connects the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>102</b> with the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>103</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0219">A portion of the opening <b>51</b> is filled with an ion exchange membrane <b>43</b>, which makes particular ions pass through.

The ion exchange membrane <b>43</b> in the above structure is a proton exchange membrane and is able to make H<sup>+</sup> produced in the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>102</b> move to the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>103</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0220">The photochemical reaction device of the third embodiment is configured with the piping <b>101</b>. O<sub>2 </sub>produced in the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>102</b> and CO produced in the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>103</b> can thus be transferred easily by letting them flow through the piping <b>101</b> in its flow direction.

      <p id="p-00233-en" num="0231">Next, an application example of the photochemical reaction device of the third embodiment will be described below.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 28</figref> is a plan view showing an application example of the photochemical reaction device of the third embodiment.

      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0233">As shown in <figref>FIG. 28</figref>, the piping structure has the above-described piping <b>101</b> composed of the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>102</b> on the outer side and the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>103</b> on the inner side and a CO<sub>2 </sub>flow channel <b>104</b>, an H<sub>2</sub>O flow channel <b>106</b>, a CO flow channel <b>105</b>, and an O<sub>2 </sub>flow channel <b>107</b> connected therewith.</p>

The H<sub>2</sub>O flow channel <b>106</b> is connected to one end of the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>102</b> and the O<sub>2 </sub>flow channel <b>107</b> is connected to the other end of the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>102</b>. That is, the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>103</b> and the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>102</b>, which compose the piping <b>101</b>, branch at one end to form the CO<sub>2 </sub>flow channel <b>104</b> and the H<sub>2</sub>O flow channel <b>106</b>, respectively. The reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>103</b> and the oxidation reaction electrolytic tank <b>102</b>, which compose the piping <b>101</b>, also branch at the other end to form the CO flow channel <b>105</b> and the O<sub>2 </sub>flow channel <b>107</b>, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00237-en" num="0235">To the CO<sub>2 </sub>flow channel <b>104</b>, CO<sub>2 </sub>flows in from the outside.

The CO<sub>2 </sub>flow channel <b>104</b> is made of a photoelectrochemicalcell that is formed in a tubular shape because the CO<sub>2 </sub>flow channel <b>104</b> is connected (unified) with the reduction reaction electrolytic tank <b>103</b>. However, the configuration is not limited to this; any configuration with which CO<sub>2 </sub>in a gaseous state and an electrolytic solution including a CO<sub>2 </sub>absorbent can flow in may be used.</p>

      <p id="p-00242-en" num="0240">A reflector <b>108</b> may be disposed on the light emitting surface side of the piping <b>101</b>. The reflector <b>108</b> is, for example, a concave mirror disposed in the tubular piping <b>101</b>, which can reflect light and make it reenter the piping <b>101</b>. With this configuration, the photochemical reaction efficiency can be improved. Moreover, reflective conditions can be changed by filling the piping <b>101</b> with a liquid. With this configuration, the photochemical reaction efficiency can also be improved by making light enter the piping <b>101</b> by reflection and refraction at the piping <b>101</b> or the gas-liquid interface.</p>
      <p id="p-00243-en" num="0241">As described above, using the photochemical reaction device of the third embodiment, which is a tubular piping, it is possible to resolve CO<sub>2 </sub>which flows in from the outside and to make materials from the resolution flow out separately on the reduction side and the oxidation side.</p>
