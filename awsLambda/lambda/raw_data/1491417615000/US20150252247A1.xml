      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention and do not delimit the scope of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">To facilitate the understanding of this invention, a number of terms are defined below. Terms defined herein have meanings as commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill in the areas relevant to the present invention. Terms such as “a”, “an” and “the” are not intended to refer to only a singular entity, but include the general class of which a specific example may be used for illustration. The terminology herein is used to describe specific embodiments of the invention, but their usage does not delimit the invention, except as outlined in the claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In the chemical industry, it is highly desirable to ship materials in “neat” or high active and easily flowable form at ambient temperatures, thereby avoiding shipment of vast quantities of water in aqueous solutions. This is especially true when surfactants are shipped over distances. The present inventors have discovered, surprisingly, a unique method of producing highly active surfactant blends that are quite flowable at low temperature and which can be diluted with water with much ease in overcoming “Gelling” issues which are well known to happen when one tries to add individual surfactants to water. Surfactant blends as highly active as 87% have been easily prepared and used in alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP) formulations deriving all the benefits including easier solubility in water. Currently, surfactants after manufacture are prepared as 20-30% active solutions and quite often, the higher molecular weight ones are either dispersions or pastes.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">As used herein the following abbreviations are used: alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP); Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR); internal olefin sulfonate (IOS); polypropylene oxide groups (PO); polyethylene oxide groups (EO); and Tristyrylphenol (TSP).</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">For methods of treating a hydrocarbon-bearing formation and/or a well bore, the term “treating” includes placing a chemical within a hydrocarbon-bearing formation using any suitable manner known in the art (e.g., pumping, injecting, pouring, releasing, displacing, spotting, or circulating the chemical into a well, well bore, or hydrocarbon-bearing formation).</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The term “polymer” refers to a molecule having a structure that essentially includes the multiple repetitions of units derived, actually or conceptually, from molecules of low relative molecular mass. The term “polymer” includes “oligomer”.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The term “bonded” refers to having at least one of covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, Van der Waals interactions, pi interactions, London forces, or electrostatic interactions.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The term “productivity” as applied to a well refers to the capacity of a well to produce hydrocarbons; that is, the ratio of the hydrocarbon flow rate to the pressure drop, where the pressure drop is the difference between the average reservoir pressure and the flowing bottom hole well pressure (i.e., flow per unit of driving force). The compositions and methods are used to flood the entire reservoir with chemical solutions to mobilize and displace the oil to the production wells.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">As used herein, the term “viscosity” refers to a fluid's internal resistance to flow or being deformed by shear or tensile stress. Viscosity may also be defined as thickness or internal friction of a liquid. Thus, in terms of viscosity it is common to think of water as having a “thin” or lower viscosity, while oil has a “thick” or higher viscosity. Generally, the less viscous a fluid is, the greater its ease of fluidity.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Examples for Preparation of High Concentration Surfactants blends.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Various combinations of surfactants were tested related to both EOR and detergent industry applications. There are three main surfactant mixing categories. (1) Mixing all neat materials (e.g., Carboxylate and alkyl benzene sulfonic acid (ABS), Sulfate and ABS, or Surfactant/Surfactants and Co-solvent); (2) mixing neat material with aqueous material (e.g., Neat Carboxylate and internal olefin sulfonate (IOS) aqueous solution; Sulfate and IOS solution; or Detergent range sulfate, ABS and Betain); and (3) adding excess water to make high concentration aqueous solutions (e.g., Detergent range Sulfate and ABS).</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In certain examples, the compositions include: Various combinations of surfactants, e.g., mixtures of 2-50PO2-100EO Sulfate and C10-20Alkyl benzene sulfonic acid (ABS); mixtures of 2-50PO 2-100EO carboxylate and Alkyl benzene sulfonic acid (ABS), mixtures of 2-50PO 2-100EO Sulfate and internal olefin sulfonate (IOS); mixtures of ABS and Co-solvent; mixtures of 2-50POSulfate and Alkyl benzene sulfonic acid (ABS); mixtures of 2-50POSulfate, Alkyl benzene sulfonic acid (ABS), and Co-solvent; mixtures of 2-50PO 2-100EO Carboxylate and IOS; mixtures of 2-100EO Sulfate and Alkyl benzene sulfonic acid (ABS); and mixtures Ether sulfate, Alkyl benzene sulfonic acid and Betain.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The mixing temperature depends on the melting point of the surfactant. Some surfactants are solid or viscous at room temperature. The mixing temperature was decided according to the type of surfactant.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The concentration of the surfactant blend depends on the concentration or the activity level of the surfactant. The blend depends on the viscosity and activity of the mixing surfactant and the available heating facility at the place that these blends will be used. Higher activity can make higher concentration surfactants. Some higher concentration blends cannot be poured at room temperature. If the heating facilities are not available, mixtures with low viscosities and low concentrations can be made.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">If the surfactants being mixed do not flow at room temperature, the mixture was heated and mixed until it became homogeneous and flowable.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The use of a base, such as NaOH, is dependent on the surfactants being used in the experiment. If the surfactant was acidic and needed to be neutralized, NaOH was used to do so. If the surfactant such as an alkoxysulfate needs to be stabilized in the alkaline pH range, NaOH was used to do so.</p>

For EOR applications, most of the alkoxy sulfates, carboxylates and ABSs are available as neat materials with high actives. Depending on the type of surfactant, the mixing procedure may vary.</p>
