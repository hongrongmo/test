      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Radiation curable coatings, such as UV curable coatings, are applied to various types of substrates to enhance their durability and finish. These radiation curable coatings are typically mixtures of resins, including oligomers and monomers that are radiation curable after being applied to the substrate. The radiation curing polymerizes and/or cross-links the resins to produce high or low gloss coatings. Radiation curable coatings are often referred to as topcoats or wear layers and are used, for example, in a wide variety of flooring applications, such as on linoleum, hardwood, resilient sheet, and tile flooring.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">However, while these known coatings provide some protection to the substrate, the coatings are prone to wear causing the appearance of the floor to become less desirable. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a coating which exhibits improved stain resistance, improved scuff resistance, improved scratch resistance, and/or the ability to restore the floor using dry buffing maintenance.</p>

      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0073">Coatings of the present invention are evaluated against acrylate coatings which do not contain the combination of elements provided by embodiments of the present invention for their ability to resist heel scuff. Specifically, the coatings are applied to a substrate and are evaluated according to ease of scuffing and the ease with which a scuff is removed. The data described in Table 2 (below) demonstrates that the coatings of the present invention (I-V) provide an acceptable level of heel scuff resistance while comparative acrylate coatings which do not contain the inventive combination of ingredients (CI-CV) do not. âPâ represents an acceptable level of heel scuff resistance, while âFâ represents an unacceptable level of heel scuff resistance. In addition, it is worth noting that the comparative acrylate coatings were much easier to cuff than the coatings of the present invention.</p>

Specifically, the coatings are applied to a substrate and each coated substrate is exposed to 320 grit sandpaper in a Byk Gardner Abrasion Tester for thirty (30) cycles. Gloss measurements are taken prior to and after the 30 cycles are completed. Pre-exposure and post-exposure gloss readings are compared and a percentage gloss retention is calculated.</p>

Specifically, the coatings are applied to a substrate and the water contact angle and surface energy of the coated surfaces are measured. The data described in Table 4 (below) demonstrates that the coatings of the present invention (III-IV) provide a greater water contact angle and lower surface energy than the comparative acrylate coatings which do not contain the inventive combination of ingredients (CI-CV). The increased water contact angle and the reduced surface energy demonstrated by exemplary coatings of the present invention result in a coated surface that provides reduced dirt attraction, improved cleanability and minimized water-based staining.</p>
