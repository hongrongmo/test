    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">A desk assembly is provided for use with a stationary chair. The top of the desk assembly includes a large movable portion that can slide toward a person already seated in the chair. The large movable work surface is sufficiently large to rest both forearms, wrists and hands thereon while working a computer keyboard, to take load off the person's arms, shoulders, neck, and back. The movable portion is free of the weight of other objects. A multi-degree-of-freedom display is independently mounted to stationary structure of the desk. The desk has auxiliary structure hr supporting peripheral devices, such as a printer. The desk has compartments that are exposed when the movable surface is moved to the open position, but that are otherwise concealed. The desk has drawers close to the chair that open on a vertical axis pivot. The desk has an electrical connections suite.</p>

      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This description relates to the field of desks.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Many people have difficulty with mobility, whether in the aftermath of a stroke, because of scoliosis due to arthritis, or many other reasons.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">For people with limited mobility, the use of a computer, and, particularly, of the internet, may be an important link with the world. However, fir many people with limited mobility, the mere act of having to sit down or stand up at a desk is access-limiting. Existing furniture may presume a level of agility and mobility that riot all persons have. Not all persons have the leg strength to cause a chair mounted on rollers to move under a desk. For those persons, it may be more practical for the desk, or the working surface of the desk, to be movable toward (and away) from the user, rather than the other way around. It may be desirable to employ a desk that accommodates a stationary, or limited mobility, user.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The following summary may introduce the reader to the more detailed discussion to fellow. The summary is not intended to, and does not, limit or define the claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In an aspect of the invention, there is a desk assembly. The desk assembly has a desk height, a width, and a depth. The desk assembly has a base having legs. The legs are spaced apart width-wise. The assembly has a body mounted to, and spanning, the legs, a desk top member mounted to the body, the desk top member is translationally movable depth-wise relative to the body. The desk top member has an upper surface having a substantially smooth expanse. The smooth expanse includes a central region and adjacent support regions. The central region is at least as large width-wise as a computer keyboard and is larger depth-wise than a computer keyboard. The adjacent support regions are sized for supporting an adult forearm. The movable desk top member is free of any printer, free of any display, and free of any CPU.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In a feature of that aspect of the invention, the legs of the desk have one of (a) non-rolling feet; and (b) feet having a lock to prevent rolling motion of the desk assembly. In another feature, the assembly includes an electronic display monitor. The display monitor is fixedly secured to the body whereby the weight of the display monitor bears on the body rather than the movable desk top member. In a further feature, the display monitor has an adjustable mounting, and the adjustable mounting is fixedly secured to the body. In another feature, the desk assembly includes an auxiliary support member supported by the body. In still another feature, the auxiliary support member is a movable table leaf, and the movable desk top member is free of weight loading of, and is unobstructed by, the movable table leaf in a further feature, the movable table leaf is a drop leaf mounted adjacent to the movable desk member and the movable table leaf defines a printer support base.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In still another features, the desk assembly has a stationary desk top member. The movable desk top member is mounted flush with the stationary desk top member. The movable desk top member is movable between a proximate, closed position relative to the stationary desk top member and a distant, open position relative to the stationary desk top member, When the movable desk to member is in the closed position the movable desk top member and the stationary desk top member meet at a gap-less join and co-operate to define a continuous smooth surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In another feature, the body includes an internal compartment, and the movable desk top member is movable to govern access to the internal compartment. In a further feature, the internal compartment has an array of divisions. The movable desk top member is movable between a closed position and an open position. When the movable desk top member is in the closed position the internal compartment is concealed. In still another feature, the body has a built-in electrical connection suite that includes at least one of (a) a line power source; (b) a ground line Internet connection; (c) a video feed; and (d) a telephone connection. In a still further feature, the body is cantilevered depth-wise toward the user. In a yet further feature, the legs include feet that stand forwardly proud of the movable desk top member when the movable desk top member is in a retracted position.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In yet another feature, the desk has a set of drawers mounted thereto at a level lower than the movable desk top member, and the set of drawers includes at least one drawer having a pivoting motion about an axis, the at least one drawer being mounted predominantly laterally inboard of said axis.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In another aspect of the invention there is a desk assembly for use in conjunction with a stationary chair. The desk assembly has a desk height, a width, and a depth. It has a base having legs. The legs are spaced apart width-wise and define a stationary datum. There is a body mounted to, and spanning, the legs. A desk top member is mounted to the body, the desk top member being movable depth-wise relative to the body on linear slides. The desk top member has an upper surface having a substantially smooth expanse sized for supporting an adult's forearms while typing at a keyboard. The desk top assembly includes a stationary mounting for a display and a multi-degree of freedom display mounted thereto. The display is mounted independently of the movable desk top member,</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In a feature of that aspect of the invention, the legs each include a foremost foot oriented toward the stationary Chair, the legs standing in a vertical plane common thereto. In a first position of the desk top member substantially all of the desk top member lies rearwardly of the plane, away from the chair, in a second position of the desk top member, most of the upper surface of the desk top member lies forwardly of the plane, toward the chair. In another feature the desk top member is a first desk top member. There is also a second desk top member, the second desk top member being stationary. The second desk top member is located farther away from the plane than is the first, desk top member. The first, movable desk top member is larger in the depth-wise direction than is the second, stationary desk top member. The display is mounted to the second desk top member. The first position of the first desk top member is a closed position, and in the closed position the first and second desk top members meet to form a continuous smooth desk top surface. The second position of the first desk top member is an open position. In the second position of the desk top member at least one internal chamber is revealed that is concealed when the first desk top member is in the first position. The smooth desk top surface is located at a height, h, the legs are spaced apart laterally by a width, w; and w is greater than h;</p>

It is possible that an apparatus, feature, or process described below is not an embodiment of any claimed invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The terminology used in this specification is thought to be consistent with the customary and ordinary meanings of those terms as they would be understood h a person of ordinary skill in the art in North America. The Applicants expressly exclude all interpretations that are inconsistent with this specification, and, in particular, expressly exclude any interpretation of the claims or the language used in this specification such as may be made in the USPTO, or in any other Patent Office, other than those interpretations for which express support can be demonstrated in this specification or in objective evidence of record, demonstrating how the terms are used and understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art, or by way of expert evidence of a person or persons of experience in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">This description discusses desks, desk assemblies and elements of such assemblies. In this discussion it may be helpful to make reference to a Cartesian co-ordinate system. In the embodiments described, the x-axis or x-direction may be taken as being the width-wise, or cross-wise direction of the desk relative to a person sitting in a chair facing the desk. The y-direction may be taken as the horizontal direction running from the front of the desk to the back of the desk, and may also be referred to as the depth-wise direction. The z-direction may be taken as the vertical direction or height direction. The commonly used engineering terms âproudâ, âflushâ and âshyâ may be used herein to denote items that, respectively, protrude beyond an adjacent element, are level with an adjacent element, or do not extend as far as an adjacent element, the terms corresponding conceptually to the conditions of âgreater thanâ, âequal toâ and âless thanâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The illustrative Figures show a desk, indicated generally as <b>20</b>. In this description, the use of desk <b>20</b> assumes the existence and adjacent positioning of a chair, whose position is notionally identified at <b>18</b>. In the combinations of desk and chair, the chair <b>18</b> may be as non-rolling chair. That is, the chair has feet that are intended not to roll Or shift when a person is sitting in the chair, or, if having rollers or wheels, it is assumed that the rollers or wheels have been locked in position such as to impede unintended rolling motion or shilling of the chair while desk <b>20</b> is being used. Although the chair may be placed in position adjacent to the desk, and may be removable, it is intended that the chair not move relative to the desk, or, more precisely, relative to the fixed position supports, or feet of the desk while someone is sitting in the chair <b>18</b></p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The front of desk <b>20</b> is the side of the desk facing, the chair. In the illustrations, the front is designated as <b>22</b>, the rear is designated as <b>24</b>. The left side is designated as <b>26</b>, and the right side is designated as <b>28</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Desk <b>20</b> has an undercarriage, or underframe, or support structure, or base, however it may be termed, this support structure being designated generically as <b>30</b>. Structure <b>30</b> may have the form of a pair of legs, such as left and right hand legs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. Legs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be spaced apart in the lateral (i.e., width-wise, or x-direction). The spacing of legs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be sufficient to accommodate as wheelchair, the wheel chair having been parked and locked. As a wheelchair may be up to 32 inches wide, the spacing between legs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be at least 32 inches, and may be about 36 inches, or greater than 36 inches. The arms of a wheel chair may typically be about 30 inches high. Therefore, the top working surface of desk <b>20</b> may be of comparable height, may be in the range of 27-30 inches, and may in one embodiment be about 29 inches. The lateral spacing of legs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be greater than the vertical height of the working surface of desk <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Legs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be made of steel or aluminum, or such other material as may be suitable. Legs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may each have the form of a single main post, <b>36</b>, that is rigidly mounted to, and stands upright from, stretcher, or longeron, or stringer, or foot-beam, indicated as <b>38</b>. At each end of tile depth-wise extending stretcher <b>38</b> there may be a footing, or foot, <b>40</b> (front) or <b>42</b> (rear). The space between centers of the reactions of feet <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> is indicated as L<sub>30 </sub>(<figref>FIG. 10</figref>). As may be noted, main post <b>36</b> may be narrower in the through thickness direction (i.e., the X-direction) than in the depth wise direction, such that it may have a substantial moment arm connection to stretcher <b>38</b> such as may aid in resisting moments about the x-axis. The vertical centerline of main post <b>36</b> may be closer to rear foot <b>42</b> than to front foot <b>40</b>. in one embodiment the centerline may be in the range of 25% to 50% of that distance, and, in one embodiment is may be in the 30%-35% range, or, generally, about â. The foremost chord of main post <b>36</b> may be in the range of 40% to 50% of that distance. That is, at 50% the forewardmost edge of post <b>36</b> is midway between rear foot <b>42</b> and front foot <b>40</b>. The desk top may be indicated generally as <b>50</b>. As may be noted in the side views of <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, in the closed position of desk <b>20</b> illustrated, foremost foot <b>40</b> stands forwardly proud of the leading edge <b>44</b> of desk top <b>50</b>. That is, if a vertical plane P<sub>40 </sub>is drawn through the center of reaction of foot <b>40</b> of leg <b>32</b> and also through the center of reaction of foot <b>40</b> of leg <b>34</b>, that vertical plane passes forwardly of or flush with, the forwardmost edge of desk top <b>50</b> when desk top <b>50</b> is in the closed position. Expressed differently, desk top <b>50</b> lies shy of or flush, or approximately flush with, or tangent to, plane P<sub>40</sub>. As such, to overturn desk <b>20</b> would require a downward force exerted on a moment arm located forwardly of foot <b>40</b>. In this condition, the entirety of the mass of desk <b>20</b> lies behind plane P<b>40</b>, and the center of mass lies far behind plane P<sub>40</sub>. In another embodiment, at least 90% of the mass of desk <b>20</b> lies behind plane P<sub>40 </sub>when desk <b>20</b> is in the closed position.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">At their uppermost ends main posts <b>36</b> have spreader arms <b>46</b> which support the body <b>48</b> of desk <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, main posts <b>36</b> may be linked by frame members, whether made of metal, such as steel or aluminum, or wood, or such other material as may be. In the embodiment shown, the lateral linking member is the body <b>48</b> itself. Body <b>48</b> may be made of wood, such as maple, oak, cherry, and so on.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Body <b>48</b> carries desk top <b>50</b>. Desk top <b>50</b> may have a first portion, or member, <b>52</b>, and a second portion, or member, <b>54</b>. Desk top member <b>52</b> may be a movable member. Desk top member <b>54</b> may be as stationary member. That is, desk top member <b>52</b> may be mounted to body <b>50</b> on a set of slides (hidden from view). The bottom edge of slides <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> are indicated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. The slides may be metal slides with hearing races. The slides may include nylon rollers, or steel rollers. Body <b>48</b> is, in essence, a laterally extending beam. Movable desk top portion <b>52</b> can be moved from a first, or closed position, in which it is proximate to stationary desk top portion <b>54</b>, to a second, open, or distant position in which it is moved away from stationary desk top portion <b>54</b>. As can be seen in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, when movable desk top portion <b>52</b> is in the âopenâ position, it reveals a hidden or concealed compartment for compartments) generally indicated, as <b>60</b>. Compartment <b>60</b> may have an array of internal dividers <b>62</b> subdividing the internal chamber or space or accommodation into a plurality of smaller spaces or niches. One such niche or accommodation <b>64</b> ma be of a size to accommodate a lap-top computer, or an I-pad, or other reader-sized electronic device. Other spaces may accommodate a calculator, or pens, books, an additional hard drives, electronic memory devices, or other materials such as may be. Desk <b>20</b> may have a lock (not shown) such as may be secured by a manual key. A keyboard <b>68</b>, which may previously have been stored in one of the concealed compartments, is shown placed on desk top <b>50</b>. One may note that movable desk top member <b>52</b> is much larger than keyboard <b>68</b>, that keyboard <b>68</b> may be placed in a variety of positions on member <b>52</b>, as the user may find comfortable, and that desk top member <b>52</b> is much larger than keyboard <b>68</b>, being both more than three times its size in the depth (y-direction) and more than three times its width (x-direction). As such, desk top member <b>52</b> has room not only to support keyboard <b>68</b>, but also ample room to support the forearms, wrists, and hands, (and a significant portion of the upper body weight) of the person using the keyboard.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Stationary desk top member <b>54</b> may extend along the rearward or rearmost margin of body <b>48</b>, and may extend across all, or substantially all, of the width of desk <b>20</b>. This need not be so. However, where it is intended that members <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> may meet flush at both lateral sides, and also flush along their top surfaces and it is convenient that it be so, such that, when closed items <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> present a continuous smooth planar table top or desk. top. Stationary desk top member <b>54</b> is fixed in position not only to body <b>20</b>, but also to relative to the support structure of main posts <b>36</b> and feet <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>. Stationary member <b>54</b> has a monitor mounting fitting <b>70</b> fixedly mounted thereto. An articulated monitor support. structure, such as a multi-degree-of-freedom articulated arm <b>72</b> may be seated in fitting <b>70</b>, and may carry a monitor, such as may be a flat screen display <b>74</b>. In this arrangement, the entire vertical loud of display <b>74</b> is carried through stationary member <b>54</b> and body <b>50</b> into legs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. None of the vertical load passes into movable, desk top portion <b>52</b>. Furthermore, display <b>74</b> is independently movable relative to movable desk top portion <b>52</b>. That is, display <b>74</b> can be positioned by a person who is standing, or who is not necessarily seated at desk <b>20</b>. That person need not be the person using desk <b>20</b>, but may be an assistant or other person. Furthermore, once positioned, display <b>74</b> may stay in the selected position and may remain there without regard to the movement of movable desk top portion <b>52</b> or the comings and goings of any person using desk <b>20</b>. While in some embodiments articulated arm <b>72</b> may be manually adjusted, in one embodiment, articulated arm <b>72</b> may be automated, i.e., it may be electrically controlled and driven, either by a manual device such as a track ball, arrow keys on a key-board, a joystick or other means, or may be voice operated, such as not to require a lifting ability or physical agility on the part of the user of desk <b>20</b>. Articulated aim <b>72</b> may be programmable to remember a given position or positions such as may correspond to settings associated with a particular user.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Stationary desk top portion <b>54</b> may also have., or include, a services module, or suite, such as may collect in one place an array of interconnections such as electrical power from a household supply, and several outlets to power the computer, monitor, printer and other peripherals, such as may be a 120 VAC 60 Hz power supply, for example; a telephone connection, an internet connection, a connection to a video or other electronic signal feed, an optical fiber connection, a modem connection, and so on. Once again, by gathering services in one location, it may be that by doing so none of the various cables or connections that might otherwise be loose may entangle or encumber, or otherwise interfere with the motion or function of movable desk top portion <b>52</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Desk <b>20</b> may also include one or more auxiliary support structures <b>76</b>. In the embodiment shown, auxiliary support structure <b>76</b> may have the form of a platform, or carrier, or frame, or shelf such as a drop-leaf <b>80</b>. As shown, drop leaf <b>80</b> is pivotally mounted to body <b>50</b>, and is movable between a retracted or lowered, or hanging position, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b>, and a raised, extended, or deployed position, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1</figref><i>b </i>and <b>2</b><i>b. </i>In the raised position, drop leaf <b>80</b> is raised by pivoting it about the pivot hinge, and then sliding the shelf along the slides <b>82</b> of the binge fitting such that the inward portion of the shell anchors against the underside of the adjacent body structure, with the distal portion <b>84</b> cantilevered outward. The cantilevered portion <b>84</b> may define support structure for a printer, for example. As before, auxiliary support structure <b>76</b> is deployable or retractable independently of motion or position of movable desk top member <b>52</b>. Neither auxiliary support structure <b>76</b> nor any load carried on cantilevered portion <b>84</b> bears on, encumbers, places a weight load on, or otherwise interferes with the operation of member <b>52</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Desk <b>20</b> may also include a carriage or frame or basket <b>88</b> for as PC CPU tower or hard drive. Basket <b>88</b> may hang downwardly from body <b>50</b>. As with the other elements, basket <b>88</b> neither places loads upon, nor encumbers or obstructs operation of movable desk top member <b>52</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Desk <b>20</b> may have a set of drawers <b>90</b> that hang, or extend downwardly from, body <b>50</b> (and which, alternatively, may in some embodiments be supported directly from support structure <b>32</b> or <b>34</b> as may be). It may be noted that the contour of drawers <b>90</b>, seen from above, may fall within, or conform to the profile of desk top <b>50</b>. Drawers <b>90</b> may be rearwardly shy of or approximately flush with or tangent to, plane P<sub>40</sub>. While in some embodiments linearly sliding drawers may be employed, in one embodiment the drawers may be pivotally mounted on an axis of rotation that is oriented up-and-down, i.e., vertically or predominantly vertically, such that the drawers open by displacement in the circumferential direction rather than by linear translation. Each drawer has a lever, or pull, or tab, or handle, <b>92</b> that is radially distant from the hinge or axis of rotation. The axis of rotation may be laterally outboard of the handle, and may be more or less located near or adjacent to the outside edge of desk <b>20</b>. Each drawer, or tray, is then moved or opened or closed by rotation in the manner of a âlazy Susanâ. Operation in this manner may place the handle close to the hand of a person sitting in a chair in front of desk <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Movable desk member <b>52</b> may extend the full width of desk <b>20</b>, and may include a surround, or flange, or peripheral wall, or wrap-around edge, or skirt <b>96</b> however it may be termed, that is curved downwardly to conceal body <b>20</b>. That is, skirt <b>96</b> extends downwardly around the outside periphery of surface <b>100</b>, and extends downwardly far enough to hide body <b>48</b> from view. Stationary desk member <b>54</b> may have the same kind and shape or profile of edging as at <b>98</b> to mate flush with the downturned borders of member <b>52</b>. Similarly, whether on a straight line or a curve, in the closed position members <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> may meet at a join that is flush and gapless, so that in the closed position it may not be evident that the two parts separate.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The top portion or surface <b>100</b> of movable desk portion <b>52</b> may be of full width and more than half the front-to-back depth of desk <b>20</b>. Surface <b>100</b> defines a work surface. That work surface is intended to be large. Past desks have used Concealed pull-out keyboard trays, as in U.S. Pat. No. 8,276,523, of Miller. Miller refers to his item <b>17</b> as a âkeyboard support platformâ, which identifies as problem with the apparatus: it supports the keyboard, not the user's hands and arms. That is, for a person of limited mobility, or of motion or body support difficulties, or arthritis, or repetitive strain injuries, an apparatus such as Miller does not permit the user to rest even their arms on the desk while typing, and clearly is not intended to permit a person to place a significant portion of the user's body weight on the keyboard support. Such an arrangement may become very tiring and painful for a user, often quite quickly. Yet users may wish to spend many hours at their keyboard during the day.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">By contrast, desk <b>20</b> provides a central working surface area, which may be considered generally to be in front of the user's chair, plus ample depth to place the keyboard sufficiently far onto surface <b>100</b> depth-wise that the user's forearms may be substantially entirely supported by surface <b>100</b>, taking the weight off the user's shoulders, neck, and back. The center of surface <b>100</b> where the keyboard may be placed may be considered a central region, and the regions adjacent to the keyboard, upon which a user may rest his or her arms may be considered as adjacent support regions.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In the depth direction, surface <b>100</b> is more than three times the size of a typical computer keyboard. It is sufficiently large to carry either a conventional keyboard or a lap top, with room remaining for the users to rest their arms and a portion of their upper body weight on surface <b>100</b>. For the purposes of description herein, the length of a person's arms from elbow to wrist may be approximately 1 ft., and from elbow to finger-tips may be approximately 20 inches. In classical terms, this measure is defined as a cubit. The length of a forearm may then be taken as roughly 1 ft, or approximately double the extent of a typical âqwertyâ typewriter keyboard. Similarly, a typical keyboard may be approximately 18 inches wide, or of comparable extent to the length of the forearm and hand. Surface <b>100</b> is more than double a typical keyboard width to provide ample room for a place to rest arms and upper body weight, and, in one embodiment, more than triple. In summary, surface <b>100</b> of member <b>52</b> is greater than a cubit deep (i.e., in the y-direction) and is greater than two cubits wide (in the x-direction).</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Once the user is seated in a non-musing chair facing desk <b>20</b>, movable desk top portion <b>52</b> may be drawn toward the user, rather than the user having to attempt to move the chair under the desk top. A person with reduced mobility may find it difficult to propel a chair under a table, but may have sufficient arm strength to draw a slide-mounted table top toward themselves. In using desk <b>20</b>, in the initial, or closed position, all of portion <b>52</b> lies behind the depth-wise position of foremost feet <b>40</b>. Once the user is sitting in their chair facing desk <b>20</b>, the forward edge of member <b>52</b> is drawn forward through the vertical plane of feet <b>40</b>, to a position beyond that plane, up to about half the total depth of member <b>52</b>, providing a full-width cantilevered support surface for the user, where the cantilever (a) extends forwardly from main port <b>36</b>; and (b) extends beyond feet <b>40</b>. Movable desk top portion <b>52</b> may have a concave front edge <b>102</b> such that the outside portions or regions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> upon which one may wish to rest one's arms actually curve around the user to some extent. When the user wishes to leave, the user may then push the table top, or desk top member <b>52</b>, away, again, rather than having to rely on leg strength to move a chair out from under the table, which may be difficult for many people. When movable portion <b>52</b> is moved to its fully extended forward position, more than half of movable member <b>52</b> lies forward of plane P<sub>40</sub>. At the full extent of travel, foremost edge <b>104</b> lies forward of plane P<sub>40 </sub>by a distance L<sub>52</sub>. L<sub>52 </sub>is less than L<sub>30</sub>, but may be in the range of Â½ to â of L<sub>30</sub>. In one embodiment the limit of forward travel L<sub>52 </sub>may be about 70-80% of L<sub>30</sub>. Nonetheless, the majority of the weight of desk <b>20</b> remains behind plane P<sub>40</sub>, including relatively heavy elements such as the main support posts which are closer to feet <b>42</b> than to feet <b>40</b>; body <b>48</b>, drop leaf <b>80</b>, rearward member <b>54</b>, and all of the monitor and monitor support structure. The arrangement of weight behind plane P<sub>40 </sub>may discourage overturning of desk <b>20</b> when weight is applied to cantilevered movable member <b>52</b> when it is moved to the fully open position.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Desk <b>20</b> may incorporate a combination of some or all of the following features:</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">(a) Desk <b>20</b> includes a movable, table top member <b>52</b> of the desk <b>20</b> slides toward the user in the direction of arrow âAâ once the user is positioned, i.e., it is adjustment of the desk, not adjustment of the chair that brings the user closer to the work surface, and the sliding top may be manually adjustable or power operated by a gentle touch, and when the table top is in the closed position, the moving portion and the stationary portion meet at a close tolerance closure;</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">(b) The top of desk <b>20</b>, typically the rearward margin thereof <b>54</b>, has an articulated mounting <b>72</b> for a screen <b>74</b>. The mounting may be manually or power operated.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">(c) The desk has an auxiliary support surface <b>76</b>, such as a drop-leaf wing <b>80</b> or a retractable sliding panel, upon which to mount a computer peripheral such as a printer;</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">(d) Desk <b>20</b> has an auxiliary electronic equipment cradle <b>68</b>, such as an under-side mounted rack for a CPU;</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">(e) Trip <b>50</b> of desk <b>20</b> has an electronic connection bus, or module or suite <b>78</b> at which a broad range of communications connections can be made.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">(f) When the table top <b>50</b> is in the open position or condition, it exposes internal storage compartments <b>60</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">(g) Desk <b>20</b> has a set of drawers or storage compartments <b>36</b> on the opposite side from the from drop leaf wing <b>80</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The base of the desk <b>20</b> is stationary, it is not mourned on rollers, or, if mounted on rollers, they are provided with a locking mechanism to make desk <b>20</b> stationary.</p>
