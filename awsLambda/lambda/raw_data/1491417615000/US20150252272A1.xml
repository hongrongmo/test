      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Stringent environmental regulations are increasingly being directed at reducing permissible levels of sulfur in petroleum and in the exhaust emitted upon burning petroleum products (e.g., fuels). Though there is no single consensus on the amount of allowable sulfur in petroleum across the world, there are government mandated regulations in all countries. For example, in Europe the Euro V fuel standard allows less than or equal to 10 parts per million of sulfur in on-highway petroleum since about 2005. The allowable sulfur content for Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) used in United States since September 2007, is less than or equal to 15 parts per million, which is much lower than the previous United States on-highway standard for Low Sulfur Diesel (LSDâless than or equal to 500 parts per million). In India, the sulfur content in diesel being used was previously less than or equal to 350 parts per million, and since Apr. 1, 2010, Indian regulations direct the use of ULSD with less than or equal to 15 parts per million sulfur.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The primary reason for targeting low sulfur content in petroleum is to curb environmental pollution. Alternatively methods of minimizing the pollution by treating emissions results in increased costs. Further sulfur may poison and reduce the lifetime of the catalysts used in automotive catalytic converters that are used to clean up exhaust emissions. Though ULSD is the preferred fuel today, ULSD typically has lower energy content due to the heavy processing required to remove large amounts of sulphur, leading to lower fuel economy and higher fuel costs.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Carbon Black Feed Oil (CBFO) is a primary raw material in the manufacturing of Carbon Black. CBFO can be acquired either from oil refineries or from coal tar distillers or ethylene cracking units. One of the major issues faced with most of the CBFO is the high sulfur content. This sulfur leads to severe environmental concerns due to SO<sub>2 </sub>emissions during Carbon Black manufacturing. In addition, it leads to corrosion of manufacturing and exhaust equipment. Another major drawback is that significant amounts of sulfur from CBFO can remain in the final Carbon Black powder as a contaminant. Thus, there is a need to develop a suitable commercially viable process for âSâ removal from the CBFO.</p>

      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">A. Example 1</heading>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The catalyst La<sub>0.80</sub>Sr<sub>0.20</sub>FeO<sub>3 </sub>(LSF) was synthesized using the gel combustion synthesis method. Thus, lanthanium oxide [La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>(99.99%)], strontium nitrate [Sr(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>(99%)] and ferric nitrate [Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.9H<sub>2</sub>O (98%)] were used as the starting materials. A stoichiometric amount of lanthanum oxide was first dissolved in diluted HNO<sub>3 </sub>(50%). To this solution, stoichiometric amounts of strontium nitrate and ferric nitrate were added. Finally, an appropriate amount of citric acid was dissolved in distilled water and added to this nitrate solution. The entire solution was then carefully dehydrated at about 80Â° C. to remove excess of water. After thermal dehydration of the solution, a viscous gel was formed. As soon as the viscous gel was formed, the temperature of the hot plate was increased to â250Â° C. The powder obtained after auto-ignition was calcined at 600Â° C. for 1 hour to obtain the chemically pure and crystalline powder.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">After synthesis of the La<sub>0.80</sub>Sr<sub>0.20</sub>FeO<sub>3 </sub>(LSF) catalyst system, the system was tested for desulfurization efficiency. A simulated sulfur feed solution was prepared using a sulfur containing species viz., thiophene (99%, spectrochem) and the organic solvent n-octane (99%, Merck). The simulated stock solution was prepared by dissolving thiophene to obtain a sulfur content 20,950 ppm. Around 20 ml of this simulated stock solutions, was mixed with about 1.0 g of nano-crystalline LSF catalyst. This mixture was then taken in a 100 ml three-necked round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser. The system was heated in a water bath with continuous stirring to a temperature of about 70Â° C. After the mixture reached the temperature, 60 ml of hydrogen peroxide (30%, Fisher Scientific) was added drop by drop using an addition funnel, over a period of 15 min. The reaction was allowed to continue for 2.5 h. After completion of the reaction, the whole system was allowed to cool and allowed to settle for another 15 min so that two separate layers of the reaction mixture were formed. After oxidation the two layers were an oil layer (top) and an aqueous layer (bottom). The upper feed oil layer was then filtered and found to contain a sulfur content as low as 110 ppm, i.e. a desulfurization of about 99%.</p>

      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">In this example, the synthesized catalyst was impregnated with a solution of sulfuric acid (30%) for a period of 24 hrs. The excess acid was decanted and the catalyst was then dried in an oven at 100Â° C. Further the dried catalyst was calcined at 600Â° C. for 2 h, resulting in a sulfonated LSF catalyst. The sulfonated LSF catalyst was then tested for its desulfurization efficiency. A simulated sulfur feed solution was prepared using a sulfur containing species viz., thiophene (99%, spectrochem) and organic solvents as n-octane (99%, Merck). The simulated stock was prepared by dissolving thiophene to obtain a sulfur content 20,950 ppm. Around 20 ml of this simulated stock was mixed with about 1.0 g of nano-crystalline LSF catalyst. This mixture was then taken in a 100 ml three-necked round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser. The system was heated in a water bath with continuous stirring to a temperature of about 70Â° C. After the mixture reached the temperature, about 60 ml of hydrogen peroxide (30%, Fisher Scientific) was added drop by drop, using an addition funnel, over a period of 15 min.

      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">In order to determine the effect of the catalyst on desulfurization, a control experiment was conducted without any catalyst. The simulated stock was prepared by dissolving thiophene to obtain a sulfur content of 12,000 ppm. Around 20 ml of this simulated stock was then taken in a 100 ml three-necked round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser. The system was heated in a water bath with continuous stirring to a temperature of about 80Â° C. After the mixture reached the temperature, 100 ml of hydrogen peroxide (30%, Fisher Scientific) was added drop by drop, using addition funnel, over a period of 15 min. The reaction was allowed to continue for 5 h. After the completion of reaction, the whole system was allowed to cool and allowed to settle for another 15 min so that two separate layers of the reaction mixture were formed. Thus after oxidation, the two layers were an oil layer (top) and an aqueous layer (bottom). The upper feed oil layer was then filtered and found to contain a sulfur content as high as 11,900 ppm, i.e. a desulfurization of &lt;1.0%.</p>

      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">This experiment was performed to carry out the desulfurization of Carbon Black Feed Oil (CBFO). For this purpose a 50% mixture of (CBFO-iso octane) was prepared with an initial sulfur content of 2.11%. About 30 ml of this solution was mixed with about 0.5 g of nano-crystalline LSF catalysts. The entire mixture was then taken in a 100 ml three-necked round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser. The system was heated in a water bath with continuous stirring to a temperature of about 75Â° C. After the mixture reached the temperature, 10 ml of hydrogen peroxide (30%, Fisher Scientific) was added drop by drop, using addition funnel, over a period of 15 min. The reaction was allowed to continue for 1 h. After the completion of reaction, the whole system was allowed to cool and allowed to settle for another 15 min so that two separate layers of the reaction mixture were formed.

      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">This experiment was performed to carry out the desulfurization of Carbon Black Feed Oil (CBFO). For this purpose a 50% mixture of (CBFO-iso octane) was prepared with an initial sulfur content of 2.14%. About 30 ml of this solution was mixed with about 0.5 g of sulfonated nano-crystalline LSF catalysts. The sulfonation of the catalyst was carried by impregnation in a solution of sulfuric acid (30%) for a period of 24 hrs. The excess acid was decanted and the catalyst dried in an oven at 100Â° C. Further the dried catalyst was calcined at 600Â° C. for 2 h, resulting in a sulfonated LSF catalyst. The entire mixture was then taken in a 100 ml three-necked round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser. The system was heated in a water bath with continuous stirring to a temperature of about 65Â° C. After the mixture reached the temperature, 10 ml of hydrogen peroxide (30%, Fisher Scientific) was added drop by drop, using addition funnel, over a period of 15 min. The reaction was allowed to continue for 1 h. After the completion of reaction, the whole system was allowed to cool and allowed to settle for another 15 min so that two separate layers of the reaction mixture were formed. Thus after oxidation the two layers were an oil layer (top) and an aqueous layer (bottom). The upper feed oil layer was then filtered and in this case also found to contain a sulfur content as high as 10,900 ppm from an initial sulphur content of 21,490 ppm, i.e. a desulfurization of about 50%.</p>
