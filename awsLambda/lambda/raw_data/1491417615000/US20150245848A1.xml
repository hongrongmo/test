    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">This disclosure discusses various methods and devices for providing multiple types of indicators to be used with a sheath set. One type of indicator indicates the linear position and alignment of each of the sheaths within the sheath set, and another type of indicator indicates the rotational position and alignment of the sheaths. Both types of indicators may be included on the ends of the sheath set proximal to the user outside the patient's vasculature, thereby informing the user of the sheath set of the linear and rotational position and alignment of the ends of the inner and outer sheaths within the vasculature.</p>

      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to sheaths, including methods for using sheaths for separating tissue in a patient, and more specifically, to techniques for separating tissue attached to leads in a patient's vascular system.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Surgically implanted cardiac pacing systems, such as pacemakers and defibrillators, play an important role in the treatment of heart disease. In the 50 years since the first pacemaker was implanted, technology has improved dramatically, and these systems have saved or improved the quality of countless lives. Pacemakers treat slow heart rhythms by increasing the heart rate or by coordinating the heart's contraction for some heart failure patients. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators stop dangerous rapid heart rhythms by delivering an electric shock.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Cardiac pacing systems typically include a timing device and a lead, which are placed inside the body of a patient. One part of the system is the pulse generator containing electric circuits and a battery, usually placed under the skin on the chest wall beneath the collarbone. To replace the battery, the pulse generator must be changed by a simple surgical procedure. Another part of the system includes the wires, or leads, which run between the pulse generator and the heart. In a pacemaker, these leads allow the device to increase the heart rate by delivering small timed bursts of electric energy to make the heart beat faster. In a defibrillator, the lead has special coils to allow the device to deliver a high-energy shock and convert potentially dangerous rapid rhythms (ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation) back to a normal rhythm. Additionally, the leads may transmit information about the heart's electrical activity to the pacemaker.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">For both of these functions, leads must be in contact with heart tissue. Most leads pass through a vein under the collarbone, and the vein connects to the right side of the heart (right atrium and right ventricle). In some cases, a lead is inserted through a vein and guided into a heart chamber where it is attached with the heart. In other instances, a lead is attached to the outside of the heart. To remain attached to the heart muscle, most leads have a fixation mechanism, such as a small screw and/or hooks at the end.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Within a relatively short time after a lead is implanted into the body, the body's natural healing process forms scar tissue along the lead and possibly at its tip, thereby fastening it even more securely in the patient's body. Leads usually last longer than the batteries that power the device(s); so leads are simply reconnected to each new pulse generator (battery) at the time of replacement. Although leads are designed to be implanted permanently in the body, occasionally these leads must be removed, or extracted. Leads may be removed from patients for numerous reasons, including but not limited to, infections, lead age, lead malfunction, and lead obsolescence due to device upgrades.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Removal or extraction of the lead may be difficult. As mentioned above, the body's natural healing process forms scar tissue over and along the lead, and possibly at its tip, thereby encasing at least a portion of the lead and fastening it even more securely in the patient's body. In addition, the lead and/or tissue may become attached to the vasculature wall. Both results may, therefore, increase the difficulty of removing the leads from the patient's vasculature.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">A variety of tools have been developed to make lead extraction safer and more successful. Current lead extraction techniques include mechanical traction, mechanical devices, and laser devices. Mechanical traction may be accomplished by inserting a locking stylet into the hollow portion of the lead and then pulling the lead to remove it. A mechanical device to extract leads may include a flexible tube called a sheath. One end of the sheath passes over the end of the lead outside of the body and enters the vasculature. This end of the sheath then advances over the lead and dilates, separates and/or cuts the surrounding tissue during advancement, while the other end of the sheath remains outside of the body. The end of the sheath that remains outside of the body is the end that is manipulated and controlled by the user. The mechanical device may include one sheath or a set of sheaths, such as an inner sheath and outer sheath which cooperate to separate the scar tissue from other scar tissue including the scar tissue surrounding the lead, and in some cases, the sheath(s) may also separate the tissue itself from the lead. Once the lead is separated from the surrounding tissue and/or the surrounding tissue is separated from the remaining scar tissue, the lead may be removed from the patient's vasculature using some other mechanical device(s), such as the mechanical traction device previously mentioned.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">There is a need for a device, method and/or system for a sheath set that includes indicators indicative of both the linear and rotational position of the sheaths with respect to one another that are visible to the user while the sheaths are in a patient's vasculature system.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Accordingly, the present disclosure discusses an indicator on an inner sheath at a linear position along the inner sheath's longitudinal axis such that when such indicator is aligned with the proximal end of the outer sheath, the user is informed that distal ends of the inner sheath and the outer sheath are linearly aligned such that the distal end of the inner sheath is located within the distal end of the outer sheath. The present disclosure also discusses that the inner sheath can have two halves, which are the mirror images of each, such that the distal end of the inner sheath can be removed from the outer sheath and the original proximal end can be inserted into the outer sheath such that when the same or additional indicator is linearly aligned with the now proximal end of the outer sheath, the user is informed that the now distal ends of the inner sheath and the outer sheath are linearly aligned such that the distal end of the inner sheath is located at and/or within the distal end of the outer sheath. Alternatively, the distal end of the outer sheath can be removed from the inner sheath and the original proximal end of the outer sheath can be inserted over the inner sheath such that when the same or additional indicator is linearly aligned with the now proximal end of the outer sheath, the user is informed that now distal ends of the inner sheath and the outer sheath are linearly aligned such that the distal end of the inner sheath is located at and/or within the distal end of the outer sheath.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The present disclosure also discusses having further indicators along the longitudinal axis of the inner sheath and outer sheath to indicate the rotational position of each of the inner sheath and outer sheath, as well as the rotational alignment of the inner sheath and with respect to the outer sheath. Providing both types of indicatorsâone type of indicator indicative of linear position and alignment and another type of indicator indicative of rotational position and alignmentâon or towards the halves or ends of the inner sheath proximal to the user and/or outside the patient's vasculature, informs the user of the inner sheath of the linear and rotational positions and alignment of the inner sheath within the patient's vasculature. Also, providing an indicator indicative of rotational position and alignment of the outer sheath on or toward the proximal end of the outer sheath that is outside the patient's vasculature, informs the user of the outer sheath of the rotational position of the distal end of the outer sheath within the patient's vasculature. Providing the linear position indicator and rotational position indicator on the proximal end inner sheath in combination with providing the rotational position indicator on the proximal end of the outer sheath, informs the user of the sheath set of the linear position and alignment of the inner and outer sheaths relative to one another, the rotational position of each of the inner and outer sheaths, and the possible rotational alignment of the inner and outer sheaths relative to one another for the halves or ends of the inner sheath and outer sheath distal to the user and/or inside the patient's vasculature.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">This linear and rotational position information is helpful to the user, particularly when the user is using the sheath set to navigate curved or tortuous paths of the patient's vasculature. Such information is also helpful to the user when the distal ends of the inner sheath and/or outer sheath are beveled such that the face of the distal end is angled, thereby creating two edges at the intersection of the face and the exterior surface of the outer sheath. In comparison to one another, one beveled edge (aka heel) is more proximal to the other beveled edge (aka tip), and one beveled edge (aka tip) is more distal to the other beveled edge (aka heel). Knowing the position of the proximal beveled edge and/or distal beveled edge of the inner sheath and/or outer sheath is helpful to the user when using the sheath set to navigate curved or tortuous paths of the patient's vasculature because the user may prefer to have the distal beveled edge(s) on the interior of the curved vasculature and the proximal beveled edge(s) on the exterior of the curved vasculature to reduce the likelihood of puncturing the vasculature as the sheath set passes therethough. Accordingly, it may be desirable for the indicators indicative of the rotational position of the inner sheath and outer sheath to be aligned with the proximal beveled edge(s) and/or distal beveled edge(s) along the longitudinal axes of the inner sheath and outer sheath.</p>

      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Before any embodiments of the disclosure are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the disclosure is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following drawings. The disclosure is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of âincluding,â âcomprising,â or âhavingâ and variations thereof herein is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">With reference to <figref>FIG. 1</figref> and <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, an exemplary sheath set <b>100</b> is depicted. The sheath set includes an inner sheath <b>104</b> and an outer sheath <b>108</b>. Both the inner sheath <b>104</b> and the outer sheath <b>108</b> have two ends, a longitudinal axis, a lumen extending therethough along the longitudinal axis between the two ends, and an exterior surface. Depending upon the orientation of the inner sheath <b>104</b> and the outer sheath <b>108</b>, the ends may be referred to as either a proximal end or a distal end. The proximal end generally refers to the end closest the user of the inner sheath <b>104</b> and the outer sheath <b>108</b>, and the distal end generally refers to the end furthest from the user. In use, the proximal ends of the sheath set typically remain outside the patient's vasculature, and the distal ends of the sheath set typically enter the patient's vasculature.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The inner sheath <b>104</b> and the outer sheath <b>108</b> may preferably be constructed of a rigid and flexible biocompatible material, such as stainless steel or biocompatible polymers, using an extrusion process. An example of a biocompatible polymer is polypropylene. Additives, such as polyolefin elastomers, may also be combined with the polypropylene to obtain the desired rigidity, flexibility, fracture toughness and/or impact strength of the sheaths. Additionally, radiopaque material may further be added to the blend of biocompatible polymer. Adding the radiopaque material to the blend will allow a physician to see the inner sheath <b>104</b> and the outer sheath <b>108</b> within the patient's vasculature with the aid of visualization equipment, such as that is known in the art (e.g., fluoroscopy).</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">With reference to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, there is depicted a side view of an exemplary outer sheath <b>108</b> having two ends <b>150</b>, <b>154</b>. The opposite side view of the outer sheath <b>108</b> is not shown. Nevertheless, it is a mirror image of <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. Referring to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, there is depicted an enlarged view of end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. The end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> is tapered, and the face <b>166</b> of the end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> is generally orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the outer sheath <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Referring to <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, there is depicted an enlarged view of end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. Similar to end <b>150</b>, the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> is tapered such that the thickness of the wall of the outer sheath <b>108</b> reduces towards the face <b>170</b>. However, unlike the end <b>150</b>, the face <b>170</b> of the end <b>154</b> is beveled with respect to the longitudinal axis of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. Because the face <b>170</b> of the end <b>154</b> is beveled, the intersection of the face <b>170</b> and the exterior surface of the outer sheath <b>108</b> forms an acute angle, thereby creating an edge <b>178</b>. Additionally, the intersection of the face <b>170</b> and the exterior surface of the outer sheath <b>108</b> forms an obtuse angle, thereby creating an edge <b>182</b>. In comparison to the edge <b>182</b>, the edge <b>178</b> is further distally of the center and of the end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. That is, the edge <b>182</b> is located more proximal the center and the end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> in comparison to the edge <b>178</b>. Accordingly, the edge <b>182</b> may be referred to as a proximal edge or a beveled proximal edge, and the edge <b>178</b> may be referred to as a distal edge or a beveled distal edge. That is, the distal edge <b>178</b> acts as a tip of the face <b>170</b>, and proximal edge <b>182</b> acts as a heel of the face <b>170</b>. Accordingly, distal edge <b>178</b> acts as a tip for the outer sheath <b>108</b>. Furthermore, the use of the terminology for proximal edge and distal edge may be reversed in the event that the orientation of the outer sheath <b>108</b> is such that end <b>154</b> is located closer to the user than the end <b>150</b>. Moreover, although <figref>FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> depict and discuss one orthogonally shaped end <b>150</b> and one beveled end <b>154</b>, both ends of the outer sheath <b>108</b> may be orthogonal or both ends may be beveled.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Referring to <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, there is depicted a bottom view of an exemplary outer sheath <b>108</b> having two ends <b>150</b>, <b>154</b>. This figure illustrates indicator <b>134</b> positioned along the longitudinal axis of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. As discussed in more detail below, indicator <b>134</b> is used to determine the rotational position of the outer sheath <b>108</b> within a patient's vasculature, as well as the rotational alignment of the outer sheath <b>108</b> with respect to the inner sheath <b>104</b>. The indicator <b>134</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is not only positioned along the longitudinal axis of the outer sheath <b>108</b>, but the indicator <b>134</b> is also aligned with the edge <b>178</b> of the distal end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. As discussed above with respect to <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, edge <b>178</b> is the most distal edge of the beveled face <b>170</b>. Positioning indicator <b>134</b> in longitudinal alignment with the distal edge <b>178</b>, informs the user (i.e., clinician) of the outer sheath <b>108</b> of the position of tip of end <b>154</b> located within the patient's vasculature because the indicator <b>134</b> is located on the outer sheath <b>108</b> at or towards the end <b>150</b> located proximal to the user and/or outside the patient's vasculature. This may be particularly helpful when the user is navigating the outer sheath <b>108</b>, either alone or in conjunction with the inner sheath <b>104</b>, through a curved or tortuous portion of the patient's vasculature. For example, assuming a portion of the vasculature is curved, there will be an interior segment and an exterior segment of the curved vasculature. And it may be desirable for the beveled distal edge <b>178</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> to pass through the curved portion of the vasculature along the interior segment rather than the exterior segment, thereby reducing the likelihood that the beveled distal edge <b>178</b> will rupture the vasculature as it passes therethrough. That is, it may be desirable for beveled proximal edge <b>182</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> to pass through the vasculature along the exterior curved segment and the beveled distal edge <b>178</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> to pass through the interior segment. If so, the user would navigate the outer sheath <b>108</b> with the indicator <b>134</b> aligned with the interior segment of the curved vascular portion. Accordingly, providing indicator <b>134</b> on the outer sheath <b>108</b> informs its user of the position of edge <b>178</b> of end <b>154</b> located within the patient's vasculature because the indicator <b>134</b>, in addition to being located on the distal end of the outer sheath <b>108</b>, is at, on, or towards the end <b>150</b> located proximal to the user and/or outside the patient's vasculature so that such indicator <b>134</b> is visible to the user during the procedure while the other distal end of the outer sheath <b>108</b> is located within patient's vasculature.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> depicts the indicator <b>134</b> in alignment with the distal beveled edge <b>178</b> of the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. However, the indicator <b>134</b> may alternatively be aligned with the proximal beveled edge <b>182</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. If so, positioning indicator <b>134</b> in alignment with the proximal beveled edge <b>182</b> of the distal end <b>154</b>, informs the user (i.e., clinician) of the outer sheath <b>108</b> of the position of edge <b>182</b> of end <b>154</b> located within the patient's vasculature by looking at the indicator <b>134</b>, which is also located on the outer sheath <b>108</b> at or towards the end <b>150</b> located proximal the user and/or outside the patient's vasculature. In such instance, it may be desirable for proximal edge <b>182</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> to pass through the vasculature along the exterior curved segment and the distal edge <b>178</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> to pass through the interior segment. If so, the user would navigate the outer sheath <b>108</b> with the indicator <b>134</b> aligned with the exterior segment of the curved vascular portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The indicator <b>134</b> in <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is depicted as a solid line between the ends <b>150</b>, <b>154</b> on the exterior surface of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. However, the indicator may not be a solid line. For example, the indicator may alternatively include a series of broken lines, a series of dots, a series of lines and dots and/or a combination of lines, dots and other characters that are positioned in alignment with the longitudinal axis of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and/or in alignment with the proximal beveled edge <b>182</b> or distal beveled edge <b>178</b> of end <b>154</b>. Additionally, the outer sheath may have multiple indicators aligned with the longitudinal axis of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. For example, the outer sheath <b>108</b> may include one type of indicator positioned along its longitudinal axis that aligns with the proximal beveled edge <b>182</b> and another type of indicator positioned along its longitudinal axis that aligns with the distal beveled edge <b>178</b>. Furthermore, the outer sheath <b>108</b> may include a third type of indicator positioned along its longitudinal axis that aligns with another reference point for the end <b>154</b>. For example, the third type of indicator may indicate the mid-point of the face <b>170</b> of the end <b>154</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">With reference to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, there is depicted a side view of an exemplary inner sheath <b>104</b> having two ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b>. The opposite side view of the outer sheath <b>104</b> is not shown. Nevertheless, it is a mirror image of <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. Referring to <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, there is depicted an enlarged view of end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b>. Although only end <b>162</b> will be discussed, it shall be understood that end <b>158</b> may have the same configuration as end <b>162</b>. The end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>108</b> is tapered. The end <b>162</b> includes a face <b>174</b> that is beveled with respect to the longitudinal axis of the inner sheath <b>104</b>. Because the face <b>174</b> of the end <b>162</b> is beveled, the intersection of the face <b>174</b> and the exterior surface of the inner sheath <b>104</b> forms an acute angle, thereby creating an edge <b>186</b>. Additionally, the intersection of the face <b>174</b> and the exterior surface of the inner sheath <b>104</b> forms an obtuse angle, thereby creating an edge <b>190</b>. In comparison to the edge <b>190</b>, the edge <b>186</b> is further distally of the center and of the end <b>158</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b>. That is, the edge <b>190</b> is located more proximal the center and the end <b>158</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> in comparison to the edge <b>186</b>. Accordingly, the edge <b>190</b> may be referred to as a proximal edge or a beveled proximal edge, and the edge <b>186</b> may be referred to as a distal edge or a beveled distal edge. That is, the distal edge <b>186</b> acts as a tip of the face <b>174</b>, and proximal edge <b>190</b> acts as a heel of the face <b>174</b>. Accordingly, distal edge <b>186</b> acts as a tip for the inner sheath <b>104</b>. Furthermore, the use of the terminology for proximal edge and distal edge may be reversed in the event that the orientation of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is such that end <b>162</b> is located closer to the user than the end <b>158</b>. Moreover, although <figref>FIGS. 3 and 8</figref> depict and discuss two beveled ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b>, one or both ends of the inner sheath <b>104</b> may be orthogonally shaped.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Continuing to refer to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, there are depicted two indicators, namely indicator <b>112</b> and indicator <b>116</b> on the exterior surface of the inner sheath <b>104</b>. Indicator <b>112</b> and indicator <b>116</b> provide a user with an indication of the linear position and alignment of the inner sheath <b>104</b> with respect to the outer sheath <b>108</b>. Specifically, when the inner sheath <b>104</b> is located within the lumen of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and indicator <b>112</b> on the inner sheath <b>104</b> is linearly aligned with the end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>, the indicator <b>112</b> indicates to the user that the end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is linearly aligned with the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. When the end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is linearly aligned with the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>, the end <b>162</b> is located at the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath, is within the outer sheath <b>134</b>, and is not extending beyond the distal end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. Additionally, when the inner sheath <b>104</b> is located within the lumen of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and indicator <b>112</b> on the inner sheath <b>104</b> is not linearly aligned with the end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> such that the all of the indicator <b>112</b> is entirely visible to the user, then the indicator <b>112</b> indicates to the user that the end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is not linearly aligned with the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and the end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is located proximally of the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and potentially within the outer sheath <b>108</b>. Furthermore, when the inner sheath <b>104</b> is located within the lumen of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and indicator <b>112</b> on the inner sheath <b>104</b> is not linearly aligned with the end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> such that the entire indicator <b>112</b> is not at all visible to the user, then the indicator <b>112</b> indicates to the user that the end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is not linearly aligned with the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and the end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is protruding beyond the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Similarly, when the inner sheath <b>104</b> is located within the lumen of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and indicator <b>116</b> on the inner sheath <b>104</b> is linearly aligned with the end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>, the indicator <b>116</b> indicates to the user that the end <b>158</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is linearly aligned with the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. Indicators <b>112</b> and <b>116</b> on the exterior surface of the inner sheath <b>104</b> can also be linearly aligned with end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>134</b> to indicate that the corresponding end <b>158</b> or <b>162</b> is linearly aligned with end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>134</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Indicator <b>112</b> and indicator <b>116</b> may each include a single mark or a combination of marks. For example, <figref>FIG. 4</figref> illustrates indicator <b>112</b> as a combination, particularly a pair of two triangular shaped marks <b>120</b>, <b>124</b> spaced apart and facing one another such that the triangularly shaped marks <b>120</b>, <b>124</b> are mirror images of one another because the apex of each triangularly shaped mark <b>120</b>, <b>124</b> face each another. When the inner sheath <b>104</b> is located within the lumen of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and the space between the two apexes of the triangularly shaped marks <b>120</b>, <b>124</b> is linearly aligned with the end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>, the indicator <b>112</b> indicates to the user that the end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is linearly aligned with the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. Similarly, <figref>FIG. 4</figref> illustrates indicator <b>116</b> as a pair of two triangular shaped marks <b>126</b>, <b>130</b> spaced apart and facing one another such that the triangularly shaped marks <b>126</b>, <b>130</b> are mirror images of one another because the apex of each triangularly shaped mark <b>126</b>, <b>130</b> face each another. When the inner sheath <b>104</b> is located within the lumen of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and the space between the two apexes of the triangularly shaped marks <b>126</b>, <b>130</b> is linearly aligned with the end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>, the indicator <b>116</b> indicates to the user that the end <b>158</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is linearly aligned with the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the triangularly shaped mark <b>120</b>â³ points toward the end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. The shape, orientation and space between the triangularly shaped marks <b>120</b>â³, <b>124</b>â³ <b>126</b>â³, <b>130</b>â³, particularly the directional aspect of triangularly shaped mark and their spaced apart configuration, provide a user with an intuitive and useful indicator where to align inner sheath <b>104</b> with the outer sheath <b>108</b> such that ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> linearly align with the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. However, other type of marks may be used as indicators <b>112</b>, <b>116</b>. The marks may have an alternate geometric shapes, such as a circle, oval, ellipse, crescent, curvilinear triangle, quatrefoil, parallelogram, square, rectangle, trapezoid, trapezium, rhombus, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, nonagon, and decagon. The marks may also have other types of shapes or symbols, such as a kite, star, heart, cross, arrow, diamond, etc. Additionally, one indicator, such as indicator <b>112</b> may have a pair of marks with the same shape, and the other indicator, such as indicator <b>116</b> may have a pair of marks with the same shape but different than the shape of the marks for indicator <b>112</b>. Furthermore, the indicator may include a combination of two differently shaped marks. Moreover, each mark may have the same color (e.g., red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, black, etc.) or a combination of different colors.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">As mentioned above, the indicator <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> may include a single mark rather than a combination of marks. For example, the indicators <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> may include one of the shapes or symbols discussed above. Alternatively, the indicators <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> may include an indicator, such as a line, stripe, bar, etc. Such indicator may have a single color (e.g., red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, black, etc.) or a combination of multiple colors. Furthermore, any of the indicators discussed above may have a particular color, and if multiple indicators are used, such indicator may have the same or different colors, thereby creating a color code therefor.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The indicators <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> may include a set of multiple individual marks or multiple sets of marks around the circumference of the inner sheath <b>104</b> at the same linear position. Having a set of individual marks (e.g., any combination of <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>â² and <b>120</b>â³) or multiple sets of marks provide the user the ability to see the linear position of the inner sheath <b>104</b> with respect to the outer sheath <b>108</b> from multiple rotational perspectives. Referring to <figref>FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, the indicator <b>112</b> may include three sets, wherein each set is a pair of triangularly shaped marks: (1) the first set includes a pair of triangularly shaped marks <b>120</b>, <b>124</b>; (2) the second set includes a pair of triangularly shaped marks <b>120</b>â², <b>124</b>; and (3) the third set includes a pair of triangularly shaped marks <b>120</b>â³, <b>124</b>â³. Each set of marks may be spaced evenly around the circumference of the inner sheath <b>104</b> at the same linear distance from one of the ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b>. For example, the first, second, and third set of marks may be spaced 120 degrees from each other around the circumference of the inner sheath <b>104</b>. If a fourth set of marks was included as part of the indicator <b>112</b>, the four sets of marks may be spaced 90 degrees from each other around the circumference of the inner sheath <b>104</b>. Similarly, if a fifth set of marks was included as part of the indicator <b>112</b>, the five sets of marks may be spaced 72 degrees from each other around the circumference of the inner sheath <b>104</b>. Including multiple sets of marks, particularly three or more sets of marks, provides the user of the sheath set <b>100</b> with constant visualization of the linear orientation of the inner sheath <b>104</b> relative to the outer sheath. Although the majority of this paragraph discusses the indicator <b>112</b> and its corresponding sets of marks, it shall be understood that the same discussion applies to indicator <b>116</b> and its corresponding set of marks, wherein the first set includes triangularly shaped marks <b>126</b>, <b>130</b>; (2) the second set includes triangularly shaped marks <b>126</b>â², <b>130</b>; and (3) the third set includes triangularly shaped marks <b>126</b>â³, <b>130</b>â³.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Referring to <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, there is depicted a bottom view of an exemplary inner sheath <b>104</b> having two ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b>. This figure illustrates three indicators <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> positioned along the longitudinal axis of the inner sheath <b>104</b>. As discussed in more detail below, the three indicators <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> are used to determine the rotational position of the inner sheath <b>104</b> within the patient's vasculature, as well as the rotational alignment of the inner sheath <b>104</b> with respect to the outer sheath <b>104</b>. The three indicators <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 6</figref> are not only positioned along the longitudinal axis of the inner sheath <b>104</b>, but the three indicators <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> are also aligned with the edge <b>186</b> of the beveled ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b>. As discussed above with respect to <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, edge <b>186</b> is the most distal edge of the beveled face <b>174</b>. Positioning indicators <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> in longitudinal alignment with the edge <b>186</b>, informs the user (i.e., clinician) of the inner sheath <b>104</b> of the position of edge <b>186</b> for ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> located within the patient's vasculature because the three indicators <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> are located on the inner sheath <b>104</b> at or towards one of the ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> located proximal the user and/or outside the patient's vasculature. Accordingly, providing indicators <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> informs the user of the inner sheath <b>104</b> of the position of edge <b>186</b> of end <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> located within the patient's vasculature because at least some of the indicators <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b>, in addition to being located on the distal end of the inner sheath <b>104</b>, is at, on, or towards the opposite end <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> located proximal to the user and/or outside the patient's vasculature so that such indicators <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> is visible to the user during the procedure while the other distal end of the outer sheath <b>108</b> is located within patient's vasculature.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">As discussed above, with respect to the outer sheath <b>108</b>, it may be helpful to the user when navigating the inner sheath <b>104</b>, either alone or in conjunction with the outer sheath <b>108</b>, through a curved or tortuous portion of the patient's vasculature to know where the distal edge <b>186</b> and proximal edge <b>190</b> are located with respect to the interior segment and the exterior segment of the curved vasculature. It may be desirable for the distal edge <b>186</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> to pass through the curved portion of the vasculature along the interior segment rather than the exterior segment, thereby reducing the likelihood that the distal beveled edge <b>186</b> will rupture the vasculature as it passes therethrough. That is, it may be desirable for proximal edge <b>190</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> to pass through the vasculature along the exterior curved segment and the distal edge <b>186</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> to pass through the interior segment.

However, one or all of the indicator <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> may alternatively be aligned with the proximal beveled edge <b>190</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b>. If so, positioning indicators <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> in alignment with the proximal beveled edge <b>190</b> of the ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b>, informs the user (i.e., clinician) of the inner sheath <b>104</b> of the position of edge <b>190</b> of one of the ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> located within the patient's vasculature by looking at one or more of the indicators <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b>, which are also located on the inner sheath <b>104</b> at or towards one of the ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> located proximal the user and/or outside the patient's vasculature. In such instance, it may be desirable for proximal edge <b>190</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> to pass through the vasculature along the exterior curved segment and the distal edge <b>186</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> to pass through the interior segment. If so, the user would navigate the inner sheath <b>104</b> with the indicators <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> aligned with the exterior segment of the curved vascular portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The indicators <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> in <figref>FIG. 6</figref> are depicted as a three solid lines between the ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> on the exterior surface of the inner sheath <b>104</b>, wherein the three lines are separated by indicators <b>112</b> and <b>116</b>. However, each of the three indicators may not be a solid line. For example, one or more of the indicators may alternatively include a series of broken lines, a series of dots, a series of lines and dots and/or a combination of lines, dots and other characters that are positioned in alignment with the longitudinal axis of the inner sheath <b>104</b> and/or in alignment with the proximal beveled edge <b>190</b> or distal beveled edge <b>186</b> of ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b>. Additionally, the outer sheath may have multiple indicators aligned with the longitudinal axis of the inner sheath <b>104</b>. For example, the inner sheath <b>104</b> may include one type of indicator positioned along its longitudinal axis that aligns with the proximal beveled edge <b>190</b> and another type of indicator positioned along its longitudinal axis that aligns with the distal beveled edge <b>186</b>. Furthermore, the inner sheath <b>104</b> may include a third type of indicator positioned along its longitudinal axis that aligns with another reference point for one of the ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b>. For example, the third type of indicator may indicate the mid-point of the face <b>174</b> of one of the ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">It may also be preferable for the indicator <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> and/or one set (or pair) of marks <b>120</b>â³, <b>124</b>â³, <b>126</b>â³, <b>130</b>â³ from each of the indicators <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> on the inner sheath <b>104</b> to be aligned with the indicators <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b>. Aligning the indicator <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> and/or one set (or pair) of marks <b>120</b>â³, <b>124</b>â², <b>126</b>â³, <b>130</b>â³ with the indicator <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> on the inner sheath <b>104</b> in conjunction with the indicator <b>134</b> on the outer sheath <b>108</b> allows the user to quickly see the rotational position of the inner sheath <b>104</b>, the possible rotational alignment of the inner sheath <b>104</b> and outer sheath <b>108</b>, and the linear position of the inner sheath <b>104</b> with respect to the outer sheath <b>108</b>. That is, the combination of indicators <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> with at least one of the indicators <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> on the inner sheath <b>104</b> in conjunction with the indicator <b>134</b> on the outer sheath <b>108</b> allows the user to determine whether the distal ends <b>154</b>, <b>162</b> (or <b>158</b>) of the inner sheath <b>104</b> and outer sheath <b>108</b> are both linearly and rotationally aligned. This may be particularly helpful to the user of the sheath set <b>100</b> when navigating the sheath set <b>100</b> through a curved portion of the vasculature, as discussed above, so the user knows that the distal beveled edge of the inner and outer sheaths will pass along the interior portion of the curved vasculature, as opposed to the exterior curved portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Referring to the sheath set <b>100</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the sheath set includes a portion of the inner sheath <b>104</b> located within the outer sheath <b>108</b> such that the beveled distal end <b>162</b> (not shown) of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is linearly aligned with the distal end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> as indicated by the alignment of indicator <b>112</b> (on the inner sheath <b>104</b>) with the proximal end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. Specifically, the proximal end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> is located between the mark <b>120</b> and mark <b>124</b> of indicator <b>112</b> on the inner sheath, thereby indicating that the beveled distal end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is located within the outer sheath <b>108</b>, is at the distal end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath, and is not extending beyond the distal end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. Additionally, when the inner sheath <b>104</b> is located within the lumen of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and both marks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> of indicator <b>112</b> on the inner sheath indicator <b>112</b> are visible to the user, then the indicator <b>112</b> indicates to the user that the end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is not linearly aligned with the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and the end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is located proximally of the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and potentially within the outer sheath <b>108</b>. Furthermore, when the inner sheath <b>104</b> is located within the lumen of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and neither marks <b>120</b> nor <b>124</b> of indicator <b>112</b> on the inner sheath indicator <b>112</b> are visible to the user, then the indicator <b>112</b> indicates to the user that the end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is not linearly aligned with the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and the end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is protruding beyond the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Continuing to refer to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the indicator <b>138</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is also aligned with the indicator <b>134</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>, thereby indicating that the distal beveled edge <b>186</b> of end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is rotationally aligned with the distal beveled edge <b>178</b> of end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. That is, the beveled distal end <b>154</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is both linearly and rotationally aligned beveled distal end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>, such that the beveled distal end <b>154</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is located with the outer sheath and not extending beyond the distal end <b>154</b>, and the distal beveled edge <b>186</b> of end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is rotationally aligned with the distal beveled edge <b>178</b> of end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Knowing the linear and rotational orientation of the inner sheath <b>104</b> and outer sheath with respect to one another, a user may advance the sheath set <b>100</b> in this aligned configuration over a lead and insert sheath set <b>100</b> into a patient's vasculature to separate tissue surrounding the lead. That is, the user may concurrently advance the inner sheath <b>104</b> and outer sheath <b>108</b> over the end of the lead outside of the patient and into the patient's vasculature in such aligned position. Once the sheath set <b>100</b> contacts the tissue, the user may rotate and/or advance the inner sheath <b>104</b> beyond the distal end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> to separate tissue surrounding the lead using the face <b>174</b> and/or edges <b>186</b>, <b>190</b> of the beveled distal end <b>162</b>. The beveled distal end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> may be retracted back into the outer sheath <b>108</b> by the user, and potentially realign the inner and outer sheaths, such that the sheath set <b>100</b> is further advanced in unison over the lead and deeper into the vasculature. The user may then again rotate and/or advance the inner sheath <b>104</b> beyond the distal end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> to create additional separation of the tissue surrounding the lead using the face <b>174</b> and/or edges <b>186</b>, <b>190</b> of the beveled distal end <b>162</b>. This process of concurrently advancing, in unison, the inner sheath <b>104</b> and outer sheath <b>108</b> over the lead and into the patient's vasculature in such aligned position, then rotating and/or advance the inner sheath <b>104</b> beyond the distal end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>, and followed by retraction of the inner sheath <b>104</b> into the outer sheath <b>108</b> may be repeated until the desired amount of tissue has been separated from the lead. The outer sheath <b>108</b> can also be advanced in front of the inner sheath <b>104</b> to aid in separation of lead from tissue; for example, when the tissue is directly attached to the lead, it is possibly more difficult to dilate than tissue radially positioned around the lead but unattached to the lead. Accordingly, it may be advantageous to advance either end <b>150</b> or end <b>154</b> or both ends into the tissue and initiate dilation prior to introducing either end <b>158</b> or end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath to completing the dilation of the tissue surrounding and/or attached to the lead.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">As discussed above, when navigating the sheath set <b>100</b> through a curved portion of a patient's vasculature, it may be desirable for the beveled distal edge <b>186</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> and the beveled distal edge <b>178</b> of the outer sheath to pass through the vasculature along the interior curved segment and the beveled proximal edge <b>190</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> and the beveled distal edge <b>182</b> of the outer sheath to pass through the vasculature along the exterior curved segment. And the indicator of the present disclosure allow the user to know the linear and rotational alignment of the inner sheath <b>104</b> and the outer sheath <b>108</b> as the sheath set advances through the vasculature, thereby minimizing the likelihood of rupturing the vasculature, particularly as the sheath set <b>100</b> advances through a curved section of the vasculature.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">A number of variations and modifications of the disclosure may be used. For example, the end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> may be inserted into the outer sheath <b>108</b> and aligned with its end <b>154</b>. If so, the indicator <b>116</b>, along with its marks <b>126</b>, <b>126</b>â², <b>126</b>â², <b>130</b>, <b>130</b>â², and <b>130</b>â³, on the inner sheath <b>104</b> would be aligned with the end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. Also, when the end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> is inserted into the outer sheath <b>108</b>, the indicator <b>134</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and the indicator <b>146</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> will be aligned when the inner sheath and outer sheath are rotationally aligned. Another variation of the disclosure may include inserting a beveled distal end <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>108</b> into the outer sheath <b>108</b> such that one of the beveled distal ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> aligns with the non-beveled end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">It may also desirable for the user of the sheath set <b>100</b> to utilize both ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> during a procedure for separating tissue from a lead in the event that one of the ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> becomes dull during the procedure and thereby, potentially becoming less effective in separating tissue. Accordingly, a user may leave the outer sheath <b>108</b> in the patient's vasculature while removing the inner sheath <b>104</b> completely therefrom and switching the ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> that are inserted into the outer sheath <b>108</b> during the procedure by inserting the alternate end back into the outer sheath <b>108</b>. The indicator of the present disclosure allows the user to do so quickly and effectively because the indicator <b>112</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>138</b>, <b>146</b> is the same for both halves of the inner sheath <b>104</b>, both ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> are equally distant from the center of the inner sheath <b>104</b>, and both ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> have the same or similar configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">It may also be possible for both halves of the inner sheath <b>104</b> to use a single indicator similar to indicator <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> to indicate the alignment of the ends <b>158</b>, <b>162</b> of the inner sheath <b>104</b> with the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b>. For example, if the single indicator is located at the center (with respect to both ends) of the inner sheath <b>104</b> and includes two triangular shaped marks spaced apart and facing one another, then a user will be able to align that indicator with the end <b>150</b> of the outer sheath <b>108</b> and know that either end <b>158</b> or end <b>162</b> of the inner sheath is located within the end <b>154</b> of the outer sheath</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">It would be possible to provide for some features of the disclosure without providing others. For example, the inner sheath may only have one beveled end rather than two beveled ends to separate tissue. If so, some of the indicator of the present disclosure may be omitted.</p>
