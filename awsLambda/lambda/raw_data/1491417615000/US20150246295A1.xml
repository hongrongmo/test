      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to spill-proof containers and more especially to nestable vacuum formed spill-proof bubble solution containers in kit form.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Ever since the commercialization of the spill-proof bubble solution container invention disclosed in the Schramm U.S. Pat. No. 5,246,046 patent, spill-proof bubble solution containers have been widely popular, have become a standard in the industry and have provided autonomy and enjoyment for young children in creating bubbles without the mess that otherwise occurs when using conventional bubble creation wands. Examples of such containers are disclosed in the following patents and applications, all of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference: U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,942,109, 7,524,230, 7,244,161, 6,857,928, 6,638,131, 6,629,870, 6,595,822, 6,520,822, 6,386,138, 6,186,853, 6,135,842, 6,015,327, 5,908,057, 5,832,969, 5,495,876, 5,304,085, 5,246,046, 5,105,975, 5,088,950, 4,957,464, 4,840,597, 4,180,938, 3,579,898, 2,858,639, RE42,610, RE39,443, RE36,131, 20110081821, 20080289975, 20050130552, 20040084453, 20030155364, 20020187716, 20020129763, 20010035413, D600,290, 12/539,803, 13,234,265, and EU0094532.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Over the years, many different embodiments of the spill-proof bubble solution container have been produced by many different manufacturers. However, none such prior art spill-proof bubble solution containers have been vacuum formed or nestable so as to be able to be provided in an efficient kit form.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The present invention is a reusable/disposable low cost spill-proof bubble solution container apparatus that eliminates accidental spillage of bubble solution and that may be provided in a compact kit form for the use and enjoyment by several users simultaneously. The apparatus preferably defines a vacuum formed container upper portion having an inwardly extending open funnel, a vacuum formed container lower portion having a trough, a removable bubble wand having a bubble creation orifice, and bubble creation solution. In practice, a user may use the bubble wand to in immerse the bubble creation orifice in the bubble solution and then withdraw the bubble wand from the container to blow a bubble. However, even with the bubble wand removed from the container, the container can be oriented in any orientation without the bubble solution container therein spilling out of the container. The apparatus is preferably provided in kit form having for instance a plurality of nested container upper portions, a plurality of nested container lower portions, a plurality of bubble wands, and a bottle of bubble solution. The kit is preferably adapted such that a single compact low cost kit provides components such that multiple containers may be assembled with each container preferably having a bubble wand and such that bubble solution is provided such that each kit may be filled with bubble solution to a predetermined amount. Thus for instance a single kit could provide for instance a bubble solution container complete with solution and bubble wand each for six different users.</p>
