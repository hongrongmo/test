      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Oil-in-water emulsions have many uses, for example many food and beverage products are, or contain, oil-in-water emulsion. The stability of such products is of great importance. Examples of oil-in-water emulsions are creamers. Creamers are widely used as whitening agents with hot and cold beverages such as, for example, coffee, cocoa, tea, etc. They are commonly used in place of milk and/or dairy cream. Creamers may come in a variety of different flavors and provide mouthfeel, body, and a smoother texture. Creamers can be in liquid or powder forms. A liquid creamer may be intended for storage at ambient temperatures or under refrigeration, and should be stable during storage without phase separation, creaming, gelation and sedimentation. The creamer should also retain a constant viscosity over time. When added to cold or hot beverages such a coffee or tea, the creamer should dissolve rapidly, provide a good whitening capacity, and remain stable with no feathering and/or sedimentation while providing a superior taste and mouthfeel. Emulsions and suspensions are not thermodynamically stable, and there is a real challenge to overcome physico-chemical instability issues in the liquid creamers that contain oil and other insoluble materials, especially for the aseptic liquid creamers during long storage times at ambient or elevated temperatures. Moreover, over time, creaming that can still be invisible in the liquid beverages stored at room and elevated temperatures can cause a plug in the bottle when refrigerated. Emulsifiers are used to stabilise emulsions, such as oil-in-water emulsions. A variety of emulsifiers, both natural and synthetic, exist, but it may still be a challenge to achieve the desired stability of emulsions during storage and use. Conventionally, low molecular weight emulsifiers, such as e.g. mono- and diglycerides, are added to non-dairy liquid creamers to ensure stability of the oil-in-water emulsion. Low molecular weight emulsifiers are effective stabilisers of the oil-in-water emulsion, but may be perceived as artificial by consumers.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">WO 2011/108633 discloses creamer compositions comprising deamidated casein. The objects of the invention is to provide oil-in-water emulsions that are stable, by using emulsifiers that are perceived as being natural, as well as improved methods of producing these. Specifically, the invention aims to provide improved methods for producing oil-in-water emulsions with deamidated casein, e.g. by performing the deamidation as an integrated step of the preparation of the emulsion, and preparation of emulsions with a lower degree of deamidation than used in the prior art. Using a lower degree of deamidation has the advantage of reducing the use of reactants, e.g.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">According to the present invention an oil-in-water emulsion is provided which has a good physical stability without the need for low molecular weight emulsifiers. By physical stability is meant stability against phase separation, plug formation, flocculation and/or aggregation of fat due to fat crystallization and/or formation of an oil rich fraction in the upper part of the composition due to aggregation and/or coalescence of oil droplets, e.g. aggregation and/or coalescence of oil droplets to form a hard “plug” in the upper part of the product. An oil-in-water emulsion of the invention is preferably a food or beverage product, and/or an ingredient to be used in a food and beverage product. In a preferred embodiment, an oil-in-water emulsion is a creamer composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">By a creamer composition is meant a composition that is intended to be added to a food composition, such as e.g. coffee or tea, to impart specific characteristics such as colour (e.g. whitening effect), thickening, flavour, texture, and/or other desired characteristics. A creamer composition of the invention is preferably in liquid form, but may also be in powdered form.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The oil-in-water emulsion of the invention comprises oil. The oil may be any oil, or combination oils. If the oil-in-water emulsion is a food or beverage product, such as a creamer, the oil should be suitable for human consumption in a liquid creamer. The oil is preferably a vegetable oil, such as e.g. oil from canola, soy bean, sunflower, safflower, cotton seed, palm oil, palm kernel oil, corn, and/or coconut. The oil is preferably present in an amount of between about 0.5% and about 60% (weight/weight), such as e.g. between about 1% and about 40% (weight/weight), or between about 1% and about 20% (weight/weight). In another embodiment, the oil-in-water emulsion of the invention comprises less than 10% oil (weight/weight), such as e.g. between 1% and 9% oil (weight/weight).</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The oil-in-water emulsion of the invention further comprises protein which has been deamidated to a degree of at least 5%. The oil-in-water emulsion preferably comprises between about 0.1% (weight/weight) and about 5% protein which has been deamidated, such as between about 0.2% (weight/weight) and about 4% protein which has been deamidated, more preferably between about 0.5% (weight/weight) and about 3% protein which has been deamidated. The protein may be any suitable protein, e.g. milk protein, such as casein and whey protein; vegetable protein, e.g. soy and/or pea protein; and/or combinations thereof. The protein is preferably casein. By casein is meant casein in any suitable form, e.g. in the form of caseinate, such as e.g. sodium caseinate. By deamidated is meant that amide groups of the protein are converted to carboxyl groups, converting glutaminyl residues in the protein into glutamyl acid residues. The protein may be deamidated by any suitable method known in the art. The deamidation is preferably performed without substantial cross-linking of the protein, or substantial cleavage of peptide bonds. The protein is deamidated to a degree of at least 5%. In a preferred embodiment, the protein is deamidated to a degree of less than 70%. In a further preferred embodiment the protein is deamidated to a degree of between about 10% and about 65%, such as between about 30% and about 60%. Deamidation is preferably performed by treating the protein with an enzyme capable of deamidating said protein. The use of enzymes in protein deamidation has several advantages over chemical modification, including greater reaction rate, mild reaction, food safety and, most importantly, high substrate specifity.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Degree of deamidation as used herein is defined as the degree of conversion of protein glutamine residues amide groups to carboxyl groups with the concomitant release of ammonia, converting glutamine residues in the protein into glutamic acid residues. The degree of deamidation can be expressed as the ratio of the amount of released ammonia by the deamidation treatment of the protein and the ammonia released when the protein is completely deamidated by treatment with 2N sulphuric acid at 100° C. for 8 h (Inthawoot Suppavosatit, Elvira Gonzalez De Mejia, and Keith R. Cadwallader. Optimization of the enzymatic deamidation of soy protein by protein-glutaminase and its effect on the functional properties of the protein. Journal of Agric.

      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Enzymes useful for deamidating protein in accordance with the present invention are any enzymes capable of deamidating the protein to be used, without creating substantial cross-linking of proteins, or substantial cleavage of peptide bonds. Peptidoglutaminase, as well as a combination of protease and protein glutaminase are known to be useful for the deamidation of food proteins. Protein glutaminase (E.C.3.5.1.44) (also referred to as protein-glutamine glutaminase, glutaminylpeptide glutaminase, or peptidoglutaminase II) appears to be the most attractive enzyme since it does not cause side reaction, such as crosslinking or peptide hydrolysis. Japanese laid-open patent application (Kokai) No. 2000-50887 and Japanese laid-open patent application (Kokai) No. 2001-21850 disclose enzymes useful for performing deamidation of protein according to the invention. A commercial enzyme useful for deamidation according to the invention is Amano 500 K Protein-glutaminase derived from <i>Chryseobacterium proteolyticum </i>(E.C.3.5.1.44) (Amano Enzymes). The enzyme to be used is preferably not a transglutaminase (EC 2.3.2.13), and preferably do not have substantial transglutaminase activity, as transglutaminase activity may result in undesirable cross-linking of proteins. EC (Enzyme Committee) numbers refer to the nomenclature of enzymes defined by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB).</p>

      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In one embodiment of the invention, the oil-in-water emulsion is devoid of added low molecular weight emulsifiers. By a low molecular weight emulsifier is meant an emulsifier with a molecular weight below 1500 g/mol Emulsions are thermodynamically unstable, and the phases of an emulsion will separate with time. By an emulsifier is meant a compound that stabilises the interface between the two phases of the oil-in-water emulsion and reduces the rate of phase separation. By the term “devoid of added low molecular weight emulsifiers” is meant that the oil-in-water emulsion does not contain any low molecular weight emulsifiers which have been added in amounts sufficient to substantially affect the stability of the emulsion. An oil-in-water emulsion devoid of added low molecular weight emulsifiers may contain minor amounts of low molecular weight emulsifiers which do not substantially affect the stability of the emulsion, but which are present e.g. as minor impurities of one or more of the ingredients of the oil-in-water emulsion.</p>

      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The inventors have found that this method is advantageous over methods wherein protein is deamidated separately before being mixed with an oil. It is thus important in the method of the invention that (at least part of) the treatment is performed while both oil and protein is present in an aqueous suspension.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The protein may be any suitable protein as disclosed herein, and may be provided in any suitable form, e.g. as a powder, granulate or a solution. The oil may be any suitable oil as mentioned herein, and may be provided in liquid or solid form. The aqueous liquid may be any aqueous liquid, e.g. an aqueous phase as disclosed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The oil, protein and aqueous liquid may be mixed in any suitable way to provide an aqueous suspension of oil and protein. Normally, before mixing the oil will be present in liquid form, but it could also be provided in solid form and melted in the liquid during mixing. Methods and apparatus for mixing the components of oil-in-water emulsions, e.g. food or beverage emulsions, are well known in the art, and any suitable method may be used. The oil, protein and aqueous liquid may be mixed in any order, e.g. all three components may be mixed simultaneously, or the protein may be mixed the aqueous liquid before oil is introduced into the liquid. Any additional components may be present in the aqueous liquid before mixing, or may be mixed into the suspension at any appropriate time, e.g. before, during, and/or after the treatment with an enzyme.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The liquid suspension of oil and protein is treated with an enzyme capable of deamidating the protein. The enzyme may be any such enzyme as disclosed herein. It is important that the treatment is, at least partly, carried out while both protein and oil is present. Normally, the enzyme will be added to the liquid suspension of oil and water. It is also possible to e.g. add the enzyme to the aqueous liquid before mixing; or to a mixture of the protein and the aqueous liquid before the oil is added, and then add the oil subsequently and continue the enzymatic reaction with the oil present. The treatment may be carried out in any suitable way, depending e.g. on the characteristics of the enzyme. Methods for performing enzymatic treatments are well known in the art. The enzyme may be in any suitable form, e.g. in the form of a powder, liquid solution, or immobilised unto a solid support. Conditions such as temperature and time may be readily determined and optimised by the skilled person to achieve the desired result. Treatment temperature may typically be between about 5° C. and about 60° C., such as e.g. between about 30° C. and about 60° C. Treatment time may vary according to the amount of enzyme, activity of the enzyme, and the desired degree of deamidation, but may typically be between about 15 minutes and about 10 hours, such as e.g. between about 30 minutes and about 5 hours. When the desired degree of deamidation has been reached, the enzymatic reaction may be stopped by any suitable method. If the enzyme is immobilised, the enzyme and the liquid suspension may e.g. be separated to stop the enzymatic reaction, if the enzyme is in powder or liquid form and added to the suspension, the reaction may be stopped by e.g. cooling the suspension to a temperature where the enzymatic activity is negligible, or the enzyme may be inactivated, e.g. by heat treatment, e.g. at between about 70° C. and about 100° C. for between about 30 seconds and 1 hour, depending on the characteristics of the enzyme.
