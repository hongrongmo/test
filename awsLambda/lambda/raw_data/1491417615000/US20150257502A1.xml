      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to a compartmentalized protective case for portable handheld electronic devices; and, more particularly to a compartmentalized protective case including a primary compartment appointed for receiving a portable handheld electronic device and at least one cell compartment appointed for receiving at least one personal item such as one or more interchangeable replaceable cells, which may include beauty items, cosmetics, hygiene items, medications, vitamins, breathe fresheners and/or health care products. Preferably, the compartmentalized protective case also has a second cell compartment constructed as a removable pouch for holding identification cards, currency, visa or bank cards, and/or keys.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Use of handheld electronic devices such as cell phones, smart phones, and media players has become extremely popular. Carrying handheld electronic devices, wallets, makeup, ID, health care products and other personal items on the person can become cumbersome. With the advent of consumers leaning toward sleeker, smaller and more compact handheld electronic devices such as cell phones, smart phones, and media players there is a need in the art for a sleek protective case that not only houses the device, but houses personal items, so that consumers do not need to carry excessive accessories on their person. Carrying cases for these devices are currently provided as holster type devices and/or pouches which receive and house the electronic device. However, none of the heretofore disclosed and utilized devices provide a protective case having compartments for housing personal items for compact convenience.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Travel compacts for carrying and housing makeup products have been provided for, however these compacts are not constructed with a compartment for a handheld electronic device. For example: U.S. Pat. No. 5,163,457 to Lombardi discloses a travel compact for housing a cosmetic supply and a mirror, both of which are encased by the compact in a storage mode. The supply and the mirror are both exposed in a utility mode whereby the user may then view her face as she applies the cosmetic thereto. U.S. Pat. No. 5,353,947 to Zinnbauer et al. discloses a cosmetic case having a base and a cover releasably secured to one another; and Foreign Publication No. KR20080036823 to Bae et al. discloses a cosmetic case. These compacts and cases are constructed and function to merely provide a case for housing and carrying cosmetics, and do not provide a compact protective case for carrying a handheld electronic device.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Conversely, other devices only provide a holder for electronic devices. These other devices fail to provide a protective case and fail to provide a compartment housing beauty, health products or personal items in a compact integrated manner. For example: U.S. Pat. No. 6,357,646 to Gur et al. discloses a holder for an article or mobile device that allows a device to be securely held in the holder while providing easy and flexible access to the personal device; U.S. Pat. No. 7,077,596 to Bianco et al. discloses a two-way pocket assembly for use with a notebook constructed over a window formed in a subsurface material of the notebook; U.S. Pat. No. 7,204,398 to Smith, Sr. discloses a multi-purpose wallet/cellular telephone case. This wallet/cellular telephone case includes a multi-sectional wallet unit having a central section and first, second, and third foldout sections that are integral with the central section; U.S. App. Pub. No. 2008/0149235 to Jay discloses a wallet having at least two surfaces defining an internal compartment; âNaztech The Voyage Cell Phone Caseâ by LTgear.com, found at http://www.ltgear.com/bags_cases.aspx?ID=3367 discloses a cell phone case that includes an area for storage of the cell phone and a separate bi-fold zip area for other personal items, such as keys, and the like; âV6075 All-N-One Cell Phone Case and Walletâ by Vitronicpromotional.com found at http://www.vitronicpromotional.com/productdetail.aspx?id=V6075 discloses a cell phone case wallet; âCell Phone Walletâ by Celi.com found at http://www.celicase.com/cell_phone_wallet.cfm discloses a cell phone wallet; âSena Cases Iphone 3G and Iphone 3G S WalletBook CaseâRedâ by HandHeldItems.com found at http://www.handhelditems.com/sena-cases-Iphone-walletbook-case-p-18159.html discloses a smartphone wallet-book case. These wallet type/or bi-fold cases do not provide at least one cell having personal care items integrated therein for receiving cosmetics and/or beauty or personal care products, or health products, instead these constructs are merely bi-folds or wallet type structures.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Still other devices have been provided concerning cellular phones with personal items actually integrated within the body of the cellular phone itself. Unfortunately, integration within the phone renders the items un-removable form the phone, while rendering the items useless if they become exhausted or if the user wishes to change or upgrade the phone. Integration within the phone itself vastly limits the ability for a user to select his/her own personal products, while also limiting the ability for cellular phone selection. For example: U.S. Pat. No. 6,424,823 to Moles discloses a cellular telephone comprising: 1) a handset case; 2) a display associated with the handset case capable of displaying alphanumeric characters when the cellular telephone is operated; and 3) a personal mirror associated with the cellular telephone. The cellular phone is taught to include a built-in personal mirror, but is not directed toward protective covers for cellular devices; U.S. Pat. No. 6,788,919 to Watanabe which discloses a cellular phone including a cosmetics container integrated therein, attached in a back of the cellular phone body; U.S. Pat. No. 7,146,184 to Tsitsiashvili discloses a personal communication and cosmetic storage device comprising a housing including personal communication circuitry having a first input portion and a second output portion pivotally connected to one another. At least one cosmetic storage layer is positioned within the first input layer for retaining and storing at least one type of cosmetic therein. The device is selectively operable in a first mode as a personal communication device and, in a second mode upon accessing the at least one cosmetic storage layer, thereby allowing a user to access the stored cosmetic for application thereof. These cellular phones have integral cosmetic packs encompassed therein and do not teach a protective case for receiving a cellular telephone, or other handheld portable device, wherein the case includes a compartment for receiving a handheld electronic device and a second compartment appointed for receiving and housing at least one personal item.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Separate carries have been provided wherein a cosmetic carrier is appointed to be attached to a separate cell phone case. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,431,161 to Carlino discloses a cosmetic carrier attachment for an electronic communications device that includes housing for retaining cosmetics and various configurations and elements for removably attaching the housing to the electronic communications device. The cosmetic carrier attachment includes a cosmetic case and means for attaching the cosmetic case to an electronic communications device. Appreciably, devices such as this provide a cosmetic carrier attachment including a cosmetic case and means for attaching the cosmetic case to an electronic communications device. The cosmetic carrier attachment is not a protective case for the electronic device, but instead is a cosmetic carrier that can be attached to the back of the electronic device. If the attachment becomes compromised, the device itself or the cosmetic carrier attachment could easily become lost.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Various purse-like devices have been provided that have the ability to hold a cellular phone and can receive items therein. However, these constructs are cumbersome in nature, and are not provided as a compact case. For example: U.S. Patent App. Pub. No. 2006/0112966 to Phue discloses a makeup case or kit comprising two hingedly connected compartments. A flat dividing element inserted between the compartments is hingedly held in place. A plurality of magnetic holders of the cosmetics supplies are removably insertable inside the first compartment; U.S. Patent App. Pub. No. 2008/0135144 to Brody discloses an adjustable size purse insert for easily transferring items from one purse to another. These devices are not protective, compact cases for a handheld electronic device, but are, instead, more like clutches or purses that are not small or compact in nature.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Even where cases have been provided which are appointed for housing personal electronic devices and personal items, these devices fail to provide integration of a plethora of personal items within a compartment in the case in a compact, organized, and replaceable manner. For example, U.S. App. Pub. No. 2009/0166247 to Gindi discloses a personal electronics device including a case having a first compartment and a second compartment. A series of integrated electronic components perform a desired personal electronic function wherein at least a portion of the components are housed in the first compartment. The second compartment defines a selectively accessible storage volume. A cosmetic tray is housed in the accessible storage volume, and contains at least one form of cosmetic selected from the group of nail polish, mascara, eyeliner, lipstick, lip liner, and lip gloss. The cosmetic insert is slid out and removed when in use. It is not interstitially mounted in the case itself, but is received within a pocket/volume within the case. This is disadvantageous for at least two reasons. It would render the case less compact in nature, and heightens chances that the cosmetic insert would fall out and/or become lost. Although the cosmetic tray is replaceable, there is no indication that the actual deposits are individually replaceable cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Notwithstanding the efforts of prior art workers to construct a compartmentalized protective case for portable handheld electronic devices, there is a need in the art for a compact compartmentalized protective case for a personal electronic device that also compactly includes personal care products integrated therein. The compartmentalized protective case for portable handheld electronic devices should have appropriate apertures for connecting external speakers, wired head phones and hand held device charging connectors. The charging connects typically comprise different configurations, such as a flat rectangular connector for Iphone devices or a USB connector for a blackberry device. In addition, there remains a need in the art for a compartmentalized protective case that includes a primary compartment appointed for receiving a portable handheld electronic device and at least one cell compartment appointed for receiving at least one personal item that is preferably directed to a plurality of interchangeable replaceable cells including beauty items, cosmetics, hygiene items, medications, vitamins, breathe fresheners and/or health care products. There further exists a need in the art for a compartmentalized protective case wherein personal care items are provided in a plurality of replacement cells secured within a cell compartment within a case.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The present invention provides a compartmentalized protective case for housing a portable electronic device and personal care items that are organized and securely held within the case. The compartmentalized protective case has a major compartment appointed to receive and house an electronic device such as a smart phone, cellular phone, music player, or other digital media device. At least one cell compartment is constructed within the case with means for receiving and housing personal care items removably integrated therein. Preferably the personal care items are provided as a plurality of interchangeable replacement cells including beauty items, cosmetics, hygienic items, oral care products such as floss or breath strips, medications, vitamins, breathe fresheners and/or health care products. Preferably, a second cell compartment is provided that is constructed as a removable pouch or restraining system, for holding identification cards, currency, visa or bank cards, and/or keys.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Carrying electronic devices, wallets, makeup, ID and other personal items on the person can become cumbersome. With the advent of consumers leaning toward sleeking, smaller and more compact handheld electronic devices such as cell phones, smart phones, and media players there is a need in the art for a sleek protective case that not only houses the device, but houses personal items. In this manner, consumers do not need to carry excessive accessories on their person. None of the heretofore disclosed and utilized cases for these devices provide compartments for housing personal items for compact convenience. Further none of the heretofore known devices include a compartment for housing makeup products.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Uniquely, the compartmentalized protective case herein provides a compact compartmentalized protective case appointed to house an electronic device as well as personal items. Personal items intended for storage in the compartmentalized protective case may include identification, keys, money, business cards, makeup (such as eye makeup, lip gloss, powder, foundation, and applicators thereof) beauty products in general, oral health care products, health products, medication, vitamins, hand sanitizer, lotions, anti-wrinkle creams and serums, a note pad, and/or other personal items.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Generally stated, the compartmentalized protective case is preferably constructed from a polymeric material forming a rigid protective case body. In one embodiment the case is constructed having a major compartment appointed for receiving and housing an electronic device and a cell compartment appointed for receiving and housing personal care items removably integrated therein. Electronic devices appointed to be received in the case include cell phones, smart phones, media players and music player devices. Preferably the personal care items are presented as a plurality of replacement/replaceable cells that carry personal items therein. The major/primary and/cell compartment may include a cover which hingedly operates to open and close to allow access to the compartment. The compartmentalized protective case may have geometrically shaped apertures suitable for attachment of external speakers, wired headphones camera operation and the like while said portable device contained within the protective case. The compartmentalized protective case may also include suitably shaped apertures for inserting charging wired connectors for Iphones or blackberry devices. Alternatively, the primary and/cell compartments are enclosed with sliding covers. What is more, a mirror or reflective material may be included within the cell compartment or on the cell compartment or major compartment covers so that a user to view herself/himself. An opening appointed to receive a wristlet attachment, or at least two parallel openings may be integrated within the case appointed to receive a strap or chain attachment so that the case resembles a small clutch.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Preferably, the cell compartment includes internal attachment means and the personal care items are integrated within replaceable cells including cell attachment means in mating communication for interchangeability and securing the replaceable cells within the cell compartment. These personal items may comprise a mini-makeup kit including internal attachment means for securing a plurality of makeup cells (replacement cells) having mating cell attachment means. The mini-makeup kit preferably includes internal attachment means and the makeup cells include cell attachment means in mating communication for securing the plurality of makeup cells, wherein the makeup cells are replaceable cells removable from the mini-makeup kit for unique selection and interchangeability of the makeup cells. The internal attachment means preferably comprises grooves/rails and the mating cell attachment means comprise rails/grooves so that the makeup cells are slidably secured within the mini-makeup kit. The internal attachment means may instead comprise low bond adhesive, mating clip, magnetic portions, or hook and loop fasteners mechanisms such as those sold under the trade name VELCRO. The makeup cells may include a plethora of beauty supplies, for example, the makeup cells may include items selected from a group consisting of foundation, concealed, lipstick, lip gloss, eye shadow, eye liner, mascara and blush and/or combinations thereof. What is more, at least one applicator may be provided for applying the makeup products.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Alternatively, the personal care items may comprise a mini-health care product kit. The mini-health care product kit in turn may include oral hygienic items comprising dental floss. For example a replaceable floss wheel with a typical cutting portion may be provided, such as those currently sold, but in a smaller configuration so as to fit within the compact case. Conversely, instead of a floss wheel, floss pieces may simply be provided as precut floss pieces having a length ranging between two to four inches. Optionally, the mini-health care product kit may be made-up of hygienic items consisting of lotions, serums, sun screens and anti-aging creams. In this manner the cells are provided as shallow trays wherein the lotion or serums are injected into the trays and allowed to set for packaging: Other personal care items may be provided including a mini-health care product kit comprising items such as breath strips, breath mints, gum, and candies. Still alternatively, the optional mini-health care product kit may include cells for pill medication, cold medication, vitamins, eye drops, ointment, adhesive strips for cuts, bandages and hand sanitizers.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">A second cell compartment may be provided that is either integrated within the case or provided as a removable pouch removably attached to the case. The pouch may be attached by way of hook and loop fasteners, such as those sold under the trade name VELCRO, or by way of magnetic attachment to the case. Instead of a pouch, the optional third cell compartment may be constructed as a restraining system, preferably a netted restraining system, wherein the netting is integrated within the case and provides shallow depth containment for holding identification cards, currency, keys, or other shallow depth items.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">A method of using a compartmentalized protective case for a portable electronic device is provided. The method comprises the steps of: (a) inserting the portable electronic device into a major compartment of the compartmentalized protective case; (b) selecting personal care items comprising a plurality of replaceable cells; (c) inserting the selected replaceable cells within a cell compartment of the compartmentalized protective case, the cell compartment having internal attachment means and the replaceable cells including cell attachment means in mating communication for interchangeability and securing the replaceable cells within the cell compartment; and (d) replacing and interchanging the selected replaceable cells as desired or as the selected replaceable cells become used-up or depleted.</p>
