      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a desalination apparatus, and more particularly, to a desalination apparatus based on the electro-double-layer (EDL) overlap effect.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Desalination of the seawater has attracted an increasing interest since 1950. According to the International Desalination Association, more than 14,000 desalination plants operated worldwide in 2009, producing 59.9 million cubic meters (Mm<sup>3</sup>) per day, a yearly increase of 12.3%. The production was 68 Mm<sup>3 </sup>in 2010, and expected to reach 120 Mm<sup>3 </sup>by 2020. Many desalination techniques have been developed with varying degrees of success, such as multi-stage flash (MSF), multi-effect distillation (MED), vapor compression (VC), reverse Osmosis (RO), electro-dialysis (ED), and nano-filtration (NF). Due to relatively high energy consumption the cost of desalinating sea water are generally high. Therefore, it is in need to develop a new desalination technique.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">For further understanding and recognizing the fulfilled functions and structural characteristics of the disclosure, several exemplary embodiments cooperating with detailed description are presented as the following. Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In the following description of the embodiments, it is to be understood that when an element such as a layer (film), region, pattern, or structure is stated as being âonâ or âunderâ another element, it can be âdirectlyâ on or under another element or can be âindirectlyâ formed such that an intervening element is also present.

It will be understood that this expression is intended to encompass different orientations of the elements in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures, namely, to encompass both âonâ and âunderâ. In addition, although the terms âfirstâ, âsecondâ and âthirdâ are used to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by the term.

      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> schematically shows a cross-sectional view of a desalination apparatus <b>100</b> according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. The desalination apparatus <b>100</b> is used to remove or decrease salt and other minerals from saline water or seawater. Salt is an ionic compound, and it separates into positive ions (or ions with a positive charge) and negative ions (or ions with a negative charge) when dissolved in water. Here, desalination or desalinization refers to a process that removes or filters out some amount of positive ions and negative ions in salt water, to produce fresh water suitable for human consumption. Since sodium chloride (NaCl) is the salt most responsible for the salinity of the seawater, NaCl solution is used as the saline water or seawater in the embodiment to be desalinated. The desalination apparatus <b>100</b> is to remove Na<sup>+ </sup>and Cl<sup>â</sup> ions or to decrease NaCl concentration in the NaCl solution; but is not limited thereto; it can be used to treat other salts or minerals in the saline water or seawater.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the desalination apparatus <b>100</b> includes: a reaction chamber <b>110</b>, a first filtering unit <b>120</b>, a second filtering unit <b>130</b>, a first electrode plate <b>140</b>, a second electrode plate <b>150</b>, and a power supply unit <b>160</b>. The reaction chamber <b>110</b> may have one inlet <b>112</b> and three exits <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>. The saline water or seawater can be injected into the reaction chamber <b>110</b> through the inlet <b>112</b>, the filtered positive ions (e.g., Na<sup>+</sup>) and negative ions (e.g., Cl<sup>â</sup>) are expelled from the reaction chamber <b>110</b> through the first exit <b>116</b> and the second exit <b>118</b>, respectively, and the third exit <b>114</b> is designed to output the treated saline water or seawater. The first electrode plate <b>140</b>, the first filtering unit <b>120</b>, the second filtering unit <b>130</b> and the second electrode plate <b>150</b> may be disposed in sequence and arranged in parallel in the reaction chamber <b>110</b>; but is not limited thereto, the first electrode plate <b>140</b>, the first filtering unit <b>120</b>, the second filtering unit <b>130</b> and the second electrode plate <b>150</b> may not parallel with each other. The power supply unit <b>160</b> is used to provide the first filtering unit <b>120</b>, the second filtering unit <b>130</b>, the first electrode plate <b>140</b> and the second electrode plate <b>150</b> with electric potentials or voltages.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">After the saline water or seawater flows into the reaction chamber <b>110</b>, the first filtering unit <b>120</b> and the second filtering unit <b>130</b> are to perform the filtering of the negative and positive ions, respectively. In the embodiment, the first filtering unit <b>120</b> and the second filtering unit <b>130</b> have the same structure, but they are provided with different electric potentials or voltages according to what kind of ions they are going to treat. <figref>FIG. 2</figref> schematically shows a perspective diagram of a filtering unit <b>120</b> or <b>130</b> according to one embodiment of the present disclosure, and <figref>FIG. 3</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the filtering unit <b>120</b> or <b>130</b> taken along the line A-Aâ² in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the filtering unit <b>120</b> or <b>130</b> may include: an insulation substrate <b>124</b> having a plurality of trench holes <b>122</b>, a conductive layer <b>126</b> formed on the insulation substrate <b>124</b> and sidewalls of the plurality of trench holes <b>122</b>, and an insulation layer <b>128</b> formed on the conductive layer <b>126</b> and the sidewalls of the plurality of trench holes <b>122</b>. Wherein, the trench holes <b>122</b> may penetrate through the insulation substrate <b>124</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The insulation substrate <b>124</b> may be made of porous material, and a less thickness may facilitate the effect on filtering or removing the ions. However, regarding the mechanical strength, the insulation substrate <b>124</b> may tend to deformation or break due to the insufficient thickness. The conductive layer <b>126</b> may be made of electrically conductive material, e.g. metal, and its thickness can be designated according to the required electrical conductivity and mechanical strength. The insulation layer <b>128</b> may be made of high permittivity dielectric material, and a less thickness may facilitate the dielectric polarization effect. However, regarding the mechanical strength, the insulation layer <b>128</b> may tend to generation of defects like a crack or hole due to the insufficient thickness. To affect the ion distributions of the saline water in the reaction chamber <b>110</b>, a positive or negative electric potential is applied to the conductive layer <b>126</b>. The electric potential would drive the ions into the trench holes <b>122</b>, so the ions can be filtered out from the saline water. A metal thin film with good conductivity is suitable for the conductive layer <b>126</b>, and a porous-material plate is suitable for the insulation substrate <b>124</b>. For example, the insulation substrate <b>124</b> may be a porous insulation plate with a thickness of between 40 and 200 Î¼m and a porosity of between 25% and 50%. In the embodiment, we choose an anodic-aluminum-oxide (AAO) plate as the insulation substrate <b>124</b>; wherein, the AAO plate has trench holes <b>122</b> with an aperture of between 100 and 300 nm, a metal (e.g. aluminum (Al)) film with a thickness of between 25 and 55 nm as the conductive layer <b>126</b>, a hafnium oxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>) layer with a thickness of between 5 and 35 nm as the insulation layer <b>128</b>. Breakdown voltage of the HfO<sub>2 </sub>layer may increase about 1.9 V per 1-nm thickness increment.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In the following paragraph, we explain the operational principle of the filtering unit <b>120</b> or <b>130</b>. When the saline water of high concentration reaches the filtering unit <b>120</b> or <b>130</b>, the distributions of positive and negative ions of the saline water in the trench holes <b>122</b> may be altered according to the electric potential of the conductive layer <b>126</b>. In cases that different electric potentials are respectively applied to the filtering unit <b>120</b> or <b>130</b>, the distributions of the charges in the conductive layer <b>126</b> and the insulation layer <b>128</b> as well as the ions in the trench holes <b>122</b> can be illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref> schematically. <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> shows the distribution of charges and ions when a zero electric potential is applied to the filtering unit <b>120</b> or <b>130</b>. There is no charges accumulating in the conductive layer <b>126</b> and the insulation layer <b>128</b>, and the positive and negative ions may distribute uniformly in the trench holes <b>122</b>. <figref>FIG. 4B</figref> shows the distribution of charges and ions when a small positive potential is applied to the filtering unit <b>120</b> or <b>130</b>. A small amount of positive charges may accumulate on the outer side face of the conductive layer <b>126</b>, and a small amount of negative and positive charges may be respectively induced on the inner and outer side faces of the insulation layer <b>128</b>. Thus, the positive ions in the saline water may be repelled away from the side walls of the trench holes <b>122</b>, and the negative ions in the saline water may be attracted close to the side walls of the trench holes <b>122</b>. This can be recited as the âelectro-double-layer (EDL)â phenomena in the art. As shown in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, the dashed lines represent the boundaries between the distributions of the positive and negative ions, and the left and right boundaries are spaced out apart from each other. The effect of the EDL phenomena can be controlled by the electric potential applied to the conductive layer <b>126</b>. As the electric potential increases, the separation between the two boundaries decreases. When a large positive electric potential is applied to the filtering unit <b>120</b> or <b>130</b>, a large amount of positive charges may accumulate on the outer side face of the conductive layer <b>126</b>, and a large amount of negative and positive charges may be respectively induced on the inner and outer side faces of the insulation layer <b>128</b>. Thus, more positive ions in the saline water may be repelled away from the side walls of the trench holes <b>122</b>, and more negative ions in the saline water may be attracted close to the side walls of the trench holes <b>122</b>. The boundaries between the distributions of the positive and negative ions may get closer, meet, and even overlap with each other, as shown in <figref>FIG. 4C</figref>. This is the so-called âEDL overlapâ phenomena in the art. Wherein, the positive ions cannot pass through the trench holes <b>122</b>, but only the negative ions can be driven to pass through the trench holes <b>122</b> and be filtered out by the filtering unit <b>120</b> or <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">On the other respect, if a negative electric potential is applied to the filtering unit <b>120</b> or <b>130</b>, the distributions of the charges therein may very similar to those in</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">
        <figref>FIGS. 4B and 4C</figref> except that any of the â+â signs is switched to a âââ sign and any of the âââ signs is switched to a â+â sign. Thus, when a sufficient negative electric potential is applied to the filtering unit <b>120</b> or <b>130</b>, the negative ions cannot pass through the trench holes <b>122</b>, but only the positive ions can be driven to pass through the trench holes <b>122</b> and be filtered out by the filtering unit <b>120</b> or <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In the embodiment, we set the power supply unit <b>160</b> to provide the first filtering unit <b>120</b> with a first electric potential of positive value and the second filtering unit <b>130</b> with a second electric potential of negative value, so that the first filtering unit <b>120</b> is used to filter out the negative ions in the saline water or seawater and the second filtering unit <b>130</b> to filter the positive ions out. For example, the first electric potential can be set in a range between 1 and 6.65 V, and the second electric potential can be set in a range between â1 and â6.65 V. In other words, the filtering unit <b>120</b> or <b>130</b> may function as an ion selector, in which the first filtering unit <b>120</b> can select and extract negative ions in the saline water due to the positive electric potential, and the second filtering unit <b>130</b> is for positive ions due to the negative electric potential.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In the above-described operation of the filtering unit <b>120</b> or <b>130</b>, the first filtering unit <b>120</b> and the second filtering unit <b>130</b> filter out negative ions and positive ions, respectively. However, when the ions pass through the trench holes <b>122</b>, they tend to being adsorbed onto the side walls of the trench holes <b>122</b>. The ions may accumulate on the side walls to block up the trench holes <b>122</b>. Therefore, an electric field is further established across the reaction chamber <b>110</b> to drive the filtered negative ions in the first filtering unit <b>120</b> to move leftward and the filtered positive ions in the second filtering unit <b>130</b> to move rightward. The negative ions from the first filtering unit <b>120</b> are then evacuated to the first exit <b>116</b> and the positive ions from the second filtering unit <b>130</b> are evacuated to the second exit <b>118</b>. The operation is described in detail in the following paragraphs.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">By applying a third electric potential to the first electrode plate <b>140</b> and a fourth electric potential less than the third electric potential to the second electrode plate <b>150</b>, the electric field can be established in a direction from the first electrode plate <b>140</b> to the second electrode plate <b>150</b>. So, the negative ions filtered by the first filtering unit <b>120</b> keep moving leftward to the first exit <b>116</b>, and the positive ions filtered by the second filtering unit <b>130</b> keep moving rightward to the second exit <b>118</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">For example, the electric field between the first electrode plate <b>140</b> and the second electrode plate <b>150</b> may have a magnitude between 5.411 and 54.11 V/cm.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In an exemplary embodiment, the desalination apparatus <b>100</b> is based on AAO material. An AAO plate with a thickness of 60 Î¼m was used as the insulation substrate <b>124</b>, wherein the trench holes <b>122</b> have an aperture of about 200 nm. An Al film with a thickness of 50 nm was deposited on the insulation substrate <b>124</b> as well as the sidewalls of the trench holes <b>122</b> to act as the conductive layer <b>126</b>. An HfO<sub>2 </sub>film with a thickness of 10 nm was then deposited on the conductive layer <b>126</b> as well as the sidewalls of the trench holes <b>122</b> to be the insulation layer <b>128</b>. An electric potential of about 1 V was applied to the first filtering unit <b>120</b>, another electric potential of about â1 V was applied to the second filtering unit <b>130</b>, and a potential difference of about 1500 V was applied between the first electrode plate <b>140</b> and the second electrode plate <b>150</b>. The housing or outer case of the reaction chamber <b>110</b> is made of acrylic material with a relative dielectric constant of 4, and the saline water has a relative dielectric constant of about 80. The housing has a thickness of 0.65 cm and the reaction chamber <b>110</b> has a waist width of 1.7 cm.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Although the 1500V voltage was applied between the first electrode plate <b>140</b> and the second electrode plate <b>150</b>, only 92 V is effectively sensed by the saline water, and the remainder 1408 V may be taken away by the acrylic material of the housing to be an ineffective voltage. Thus, only an electric field of about 54.11 V/cm has an effect on the positive and negative ions in the reaction chamber <b>110</b>. The electric field may drive the filtered negative ions in the first filtering unit <b>120</b> to move leftward into the first exit <b>116</b> and the filtered positive ions in the second filtering unit <b>130</b> to move rightward into the second exit <b>118</b>. Hence, the adsorption and accumulation of the ions on the side walls of the trench holes <b>122</b> can be prevented so that the ions can be evacuated from the trench holes <b>122</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Moreover, to improve the desalination performance, the desalination apparatus <b>100</b> can be designed to construct a circulative feedback system. For example, the third exit <b>114</b> can be connected to the inlet <b>112</b>, so that the treated saline water outputted from the third exit <b>114</b> of the desalination apparatus <b>100</b> can be fed back into the inlet <b>112</b> of the desalination apparatus <b>100</b> circulatively. To verify the desalination performance of the circulative desalination apparatus <b>100</b>, a 1M (or 1000 mM) NaCl solution is injected into the device. <figref>FIG. 5</figref> shows the measured concentration of the NaCl solution processed by the desalination apparatus <b>100</b> of the embodiment at different cycle times. As shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the concentration of the NaCl solution can be decreased to 835.08 mM, corresponding to a desalination efficiency of 16.5%, after ten cycles of desalination.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Consider the case that only the electric potentials of 1V and â1V are respectively applied to the first filtering unit <b>120</b> and the second filtering unit <b>130</b>, with no voltage application between the first electrode plate <b>140</b> and the second electrode plate <b>150</b>. That is to say, only the filtering units <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> affect the input saline water. After injecting a 1000 mM NaCl solution into the desalination apparatus <b>100</b>, we measured the concentration of the output NaCl solution at the third exit <b>114</b>. As the dashed-line curve shows in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the concentration would go down to a minimum (e.g. 984 mM) and then go up back to 1000 mM. This is because the ion adsorption of the filtering units <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> may have been saturated at the minimum, and the concentration increases reversely after that. At this moment, if the electric potentials are switched off, the concentration would go up to a maximum (e.g. 1010 mM) and then go down back to 1000 mM, as the solid-line curve shows in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>. The reason for the concentration increment comes from the fact that the adsorbed ions on the filtering units <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> may depart back to the NaCl solution after the electric potentials are switched off. <figref>FIG. 6</figref> shows the measured concentration of the NaCl solution processed by the desalination apparatus <b>100</b> of this case according to the solution flow. The results indicate that the filtering units <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> can adsorb ions in the NaCl solution to decrease its concentration, when positive and negative potentials are respectively applied to the first filtering unit <b>120</b> and the second filtering unit <b>130</b>. However, the ion adsorbability of the filtering units <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> would saturate, and the saturation would limit the desalination efficiency of the desalination apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Next, consider the case that the electric potentials of 1V and â1V are respectively applied to the first filtering unit <b>120</b> and the second filtering unit <b>130</b>, and an electric voltage of 1500V applied between the first electrode plate <b>140</b> and the second electrode plate <b>150</b>. After injecting a 1000 mM NaCl solution into the desalination apparatus <b>100</b>, we measured the concentration of the output NaCl solution at the third exit <b>114</b>. <figref>FIG. 7</figref> shows the measured concentration of the NaCl solution processed by the desalination apparatus <b>100</b> of this case according to the solution flow. Wherein, the solid-line curve represents the concentration measurement of the NaCl solution for every 5 c.c. solution flow, and the dashed-line curve represents cumulative measurement results for the NaCl solution. It should be noted that too much ion adsorption on the filtering units <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> would cause a loss in measurement accuracy, and this can be avoided by the above-mentioned every-5 c.c.-flow measurement. As shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the concentration of the NaCl solution can be reduced from 1000 mM to 941.13 mM at the flow of 10 c.c. after treated by the desalination apparatus <b>100</b>. The desalination efficiency is estimated to be 5.9%. Also, the desalination apparatus <b>100</b> has an average desalination capacity to reduce concentration of the NaCl solution from 1000 mM to 981 mM, which corresponds to a desalination efficiency of 5.9%.</p>
