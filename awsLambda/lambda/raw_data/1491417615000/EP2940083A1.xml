    <heading id="h-00002-en">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Aluminum flakes are used in broad fields as a metallic pigment contained in paint compositions, ink compositions, resin compositions, cosmetics and the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In general, aluminum flakes are obtained by wet-grinding an aluminum powder as a raw material (also referred to as "raw material aluminum powder") and a grinding aid in an organic solvent by using a grinding device having grinding media such as a ball mill or an attritor to flake the aluminum powder as a raw material.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The metallic texture of a paint film obtained by applying a paint or the like containing aluminum flakes to a base material is determined principally by the shape, the surface smoothness, the average particle size, the particle size distribution, the average thickness, the thickness distribution, the aspect ratio and so on of the aluminum flakes, and these parameters are adjusted by the combination of the properties of the raw material aluminum powder and the grinding condition. <patcit id="pcit-00001" dnum="WO2003022934A"><text>WO 2003/022934</text></patcit> (hereinafter, Patent Document 1) discloses development of a technique of obtaining an aluminum flake pigment having high brightness by adjusting these parameters.</p>

    <heading id="h-00005-en">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
    <heading id="h-00006-en">TECHNICAL PROBLEM</heading>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The metallic texture is visually recognized by the combination of brightness, luminosity, glittering texture and so on, and there has been a high tendency to desire a paint film of high brightness. In flaking a raw material aluminum powder by using a grinding device having grinding media, there is a general tendency that the time required for flaking is short when the impact applied to the raw material aluminum powder from the grinding media is strong, whereas the time required for flaking is longer when the impact is weak.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">For producing aluminum flakes (also referred to as "aluminum flake pigment") that give a paint film of high brightness as described above, an approach of smoothening the surface of the aluminum flakes, and an approach of inhibiting tearing of aluminum flakes due to strong collision with the grinding media are proposed.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">As an approach different from the approach of increasing the brightness mainly by changing the grinding media, changing the solvent for use in production of aluminum flakes (also referred to as "grinding solvent") is conducted.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Through examination of various solvents, inventors of the present application unexpectedly found that aluminum flakes having higher brightness compared with those obtainable by conventional methods can be obtained by using, as a grinding solvent, an organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient rather than using, as a grinding solvent, an organic solvent containing an aliphatic hydrocarbon (typically mineral spirit) as a main ingredient that is ordinarily used. This is attributable to the fact that by using a solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient, the powdering impact applied to the aluminum flakes from the grinding media is weakened and tearing of the aluminum flakes can be controlled.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">However, when the organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient is used as the grinding solvent, solubility of fatty acids such as oleic acid and stearic acid in the grinding solvent increases in comparison with the case where an organic solvent containing an aliphatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient (typically mineral spirit) is used. Fatty acids such as oleic acid and stearic acid are added as a grinding aid at the time of flaking (grinding), and adhere to the surface of the aluminum flakes after formation of flakes to play roles of imparting parallel alignment to the aluminum flakes, inhibiting aggregation, and protecting the surface of the aluminum flakes. However, if the solubility of these compounds in the grinding solvent increases, the amount of fatty acid adhered to the surface of the aluminum flakes decreases. Accordingly, aggregation occurs with the lapse of time, and hence the storage stability of the aluminum flake paste deteriorates. Accordingly, it has been considered difficult to put the method for producing an aluminum flake paste using an organic solvent containing, as a main ingredient, an aromatic hydrocarbon as a grinding solvent to practical use.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The present invention was devised in consideration of the aforementioned current circumstances, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for producing an aluminum flake paste imparting high brightness while keeping the storage stability.</p>
    <heading id="h-00007-en">SOLUTION TO PROBLEM</heading>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Based on the aforementioned findings, the present inventors examined why the aluminum flake paste produced by the production method using an organic solvent containing, as a main ingredient, an aromatic hydrocarbon as a grinding solvent has high brightness. The inventors focused on the difference in shape between the aluminum flakes obtained by using, as a grinding solvent, an organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient and the aluminum flakes obtained by using conventional mineral spirit as a grinding solvent, and measured the circularity of these. As a result, the inventors revealed that the aluminum flakes obtained by using, as a grinding solvent, an organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient are more approximate to a perfect circle. The inventors also found that the aluminum flakes that are more approximate to a perfect circle give higher brightness. Further, the inventors found that it is effective to adhere an organic compound having a polar group such as a fatty acid to the surface of the aluminum flakes in a separate step for inhibiting aggregation of the aluminum flakes obtained by using, as a grinding solvent, an organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient and improving the storage stability, and accomplished the present invention.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Specifically, the present invention is a method for producing an aluminum flake paste including a first step of flaking a raw material aluminum powder in an organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient to give aluminum flakes, and a second step of treating the aluminum flakes obtained in the first step with an organic compound having a polar group, and forming the treated flakes into a paste.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Preferably, the organic compound having a polar group is at least one selected from the group consisting of a fatty acid, an aliphatic amine, a fatty acid amide, an aliphatic alcohol, and an ester of a fatty acid and an aliphatic alcohol.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Further, the present invention is an aluminum flake paste containing aluminum flakes, wherein letting the water covering area (cm<sup>2</sup>/g) of the whole of the aluminum flakes contained in the aluminum flake paste be A, and the circularity of the aluminum flakes having a surface area greater than or equal to 250 Âµm<sup>2</sup> be B, the ratio A/B is greater than or equal to 6000 (cm<sup>2</sup>/g).</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Preferably, the aluminum flake paste contains the organic compound having a polar group in an amount of greater than or equal to 0.5% by mass in terms of carbon amount.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Preferably, the organic compound having a polar group is at least one selected from the group consisting of a fatty acid, an aliphatic amine, a fatty acid amide, an aliphatic alcohol, and an ester of a fatty acid and an aliphatic alcohol.</p>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Further, the present invention is a metallic colored matter obtained by using the aluminum flake paste according to any of the above descriptions.</p>

    <heading id="h-00010-en">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail by indicating the embodiments.</p>
    <heading id="h-00011-en">&lt;Method for producing aluminum flake paste&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">A method for producing an aluminum flake paste of the present invention is characterized in that it includes a first step of flaking a raw material aluminum powder in an organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient to give aluminum flakes, and a second step of treating the aluminum flakes obtained in the first step with an organic compound having a polar group, and forming the treated flakes into a paste. The production method of the present invention may include other steps as far as the first step and the second step are included. As such other steps, a solid-liquid separation step such as a filtering operation or a screening operation can be recited.</p>
    <heading id="h-00012-en">&lt;First step&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The first step of the production method of the present invention is a step of flaking a raw material aluminum powder in an organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient to give aluminum flakes. The raw material used in the first step, and the condition of the first step will be described below.</p>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">For flaking a raw material aluminum powder, a grinding device having grinding media is used. The term "flaking" used herein means forming a powder in a particulate form into a flake form (scale form) by means of a grinding device or the like. The grinding device used in the present invention is not particularly limited in terms of its type, and a grinding device conventionally known in the art can be preferably used. For example, a grinding device of the attritor type having a revolving arm inside, or a cylindrical ball mill can be preferably used. Among the above exemplary grinding devices, a cylindrical ball mill is particularly preferred because aluminum flakes having the quality of higher brightness can be obtained.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In the production method of the present invention, when a ball mill is used, the number of revolutions of the ball mill is preferably less than or equal to 95% of the critical number of revolutions. The term "critical number of revolutions" used herein refers to the number of revolutions at or above which balls (grinding media) are fixed to the inner wall of the ball mill by the centrifugal force, and is represented by the following formula (1). <maths id="maths-00001-en" num="(1)"><math display="block"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi><mo>=</mo><mfenced open="[" close="]" separators=""><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn><mo>/</mo><mfenced separators=""><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn><mo>â¢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Ï</mi></mfenced></mfenced><mo>Ã</mo><msup><mfenced separators=""><mi mathvariant="normal">g</mi><mo>/</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">r</mi></mfenced><mrow><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></math><img id="img-00001-en" wi="46" he="6" img-content="math" file="imgb0001.tif" img-format="tif" /></maths> wherein n stands for the number of revolutions (rpm), g stands for the gravitational acceleration (3528000 cm/min<sup>2</sup>), and r stands for the radius of the ball mill (cm).</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">If the number of revolutions of the ball mill exceeds 95% of the critical number of revolutions, the powdering effect is superior to the grinding effect, so that sufficient flaking cannot be achieved, and inversely large flake particles are fragmented to give extra fine particles. Accordingly, the brightness of the paint film containing the aluminum flake paste tends to deteriorate. In particular, when steel balls having a diameter less than or equal to 1 mm are used as the grinding media, the impulsive force due to collision of the grinding media is large at the number of revolutions of the ball mill that is approximate to the critical number of revolutions. This shortens the service life of the grinding media and tends to interfere with the continuous use. This is because a grinding medium formed of a steel ball having a diameter less than or equal to 1 mm does not generally have a cured film formed on its surface. By keeping the number of revolutions of the ball mill less than or equal to 95% of the critical number of revolutions, it is possible to extend the service life of the grinding media.</p>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The grinding time is not particularly limited, and may be appropriately determined according to the diameter of the grinding media, the mass of the grinding media, the amount of the grinding solvent, the number of revolutions and so on. It is typically 3 to 48 hours.</p>
    <heading id="h-00013-en">&lt;Grinding media&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">As the grinding media used in the aforementioned grinding device, those made of various materials including, but not particularly limited to, steel balls, stainless balls, glass balls and ceramic balls can be used, however, spherical media made of materials containing steel are preferably used from the view point of specific gravity and economy. While the grinding media used herein are preferably spherical, the grinding media are not necessarily required to be perfectly spherical, and are only required to be substantially spherical grinding media. The size of the grinding media can be appropriately selected according to the aluminum flakes that are intended to be finally obtained, and preferably ranges from 0.3 mm to 5.0 mm in diameter. When the aluminum flakes that are intended to be finally obtained have a relatively small particle size and high brightness, the diameter preferably ranges from 0.3 mm to 1.0 mm, and more preferably ranges from 0.5 mm to 0.8 mm particularly in the case of using steel balls as the grinding media to make it possible to flake the fine raw material aluminum powder. If the diameter exceeds 1.0 mm, the fine raw material aluminum powder is trapped between grinding media, and the raw material aluminum powder is difficult to be ground, and can be failed to be flaked efficiently. On the other hand, if the diameter is less than 0.3 mm, the mass of the grinding media is so light that the grinding power is poor, and too long a time is required for flaking, so that the raw material aluminum powder can be substantially failed to be flaked. As the grinding media, a mixture of two or more kinds of grinding media having different diameters may be used. Grinding media having a diameter exceeding 1.0 mm may be contained in the grinding device for use in the present invention. The amount of the grinding media can be varied according to the amount of the raw material aluminum powder to be put into the grinding device as will be described later.</p>

    <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In the production method of the present invention, the raw material aluminum powder as a raw material of the aluminum flake paste is not particularly limited. The powder may be composed exclusively of aluminum, or may be composed of an aluminum-based alloy, and the purity of aluminum is not particularly limited. For further improving the gloss of a paint film and a printed matter, it is typically preferred to use pure aluminum, and pure aluminum having a purity greater than or equal to 99.9% by mass is further preferred.</p>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The amount of oxygen contained in the raw material aluminum powder varies depending on the particle size or the shape of the raw material aluminum powder. The amount is preferably, but not limited to, less than or equal to 0.5% by mass. If the oxygen amount exceeds 0.5% by mass, the oxide film is stiff so that production of thin flakes tends to be difficult because of reduction in ductility.</p>
    <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Although the raw material aluminum powder for use in the production method of the present invention can be obtained by any production method, an atomized aluminum powder is preferred from the view point of the availability or the cost.</p>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">An atomized aluminum powder is a raw material aluminum powder that is obtained by a conventionally known atomizing method, and non-limitative examples of the atomizing medium include the air, nitrogen, argon gas, carbon dioxide gas, helium gas and a mixed gas containing at least one kind of these gases. Also, liquids such as water may be used as the atomizing medium. Among these, a raw material aluminum powder that is obtained by an atomizing method using argon gas or nitrogen gas as an atomizing medium is particularly preferred because it has a shape approximate to a sphere, and it facilitates production of aluminum flakes having high circularity by using such a raw material aluminum powder.</p>
    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The shape of the raw material aluminum powder for use in the production method of the present invention is not particularly limited, and may be any of a spherical shape, a flat shape, a plate shape, a teardrop shape, a needle shape, a spheroidal shape, and an indeterminate shape. However, those more approximate to a spherical shape are more preferred because the circularity is higher and it becomes easy to obtain aluminum flakes having high brightness.</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The average particle size of the raw material aluminum powder for use in the production method of the present invention is not particularly limited, and is preferably greater than or equal to 1.0 Âµm and less than or equal to 50.0 Âµm, more preferably ranges from 1.0 to 10.0 Âµm, and further preferably ranges from 1.0 to 6.0 Âµm. In the present invention, the average particle size (D50) can be determined by calculating the volume average from distribution of particle sizes measured by the laser diffraction method.</p>
    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">If D50<sub>A1</sub> exceeds 50.0 Âµm, the average particle size of the aluminum flakes after flaking is large, so that the orientation of the aluminum flakes can be disarranged at the time of forming a paint film containing the aluminum flake paste, graininess appears on the surface of the paint film due to projection of the aluminum flakes, or the design of the paint film is not favored depending on its use because the glittering texture of the paint film is too strong. On the other hand, if D50<sub>A1</sub> is less than 1.0 Âµm, there is a tendency that the raw material aluminum powder cannot be flaked efficiently and sufficient paint film brightness cannot be obtained particularly when grinding media having a small diameter are used (for example, when flaking is conducted by using grinding media ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 mm).</p>
    <heading id="h-00015-en">&lt;Ratio between average particle size of raw material aluminum powder and diameter of grinding media&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In the production method of the present invention, while the ratio (D50<sub>Al</sub>/D<sub>B</sub>) between the average particle size of the raw material aluminum powder (D50<sub>Al</sub>) and the diameter of the grinding media (D<sub>B</sub>) is not particularly limited, it preferably ranges from 0.001 to 0.02, and more preferably ranges from 0.0015 to 0.008 when grinding media of steel balls are used. The value of D50<sub>Al</sub>/D<sub>B</sub> within the above range makes it possible to flake a finer raw material aluminum powder, and improves the brightness of the aluminum flake paste. If the value of D50<sub>Al</sub>/D<sub>B</sub> is less than 0.001, the gap of the grinding media of steel balls is too large relative to the raw material aluminum powder. As a result, the raw material aluminum powder cannot be flaked efficiently, so that fine aluminum flakes that are not flaked enough can be contained, and grinding for a long time is required to advance the flaking, during which tearing of large aluminum flakes can occur, and the brightness of the aluminum flake paste tends to decrease. On the other hand, if the value of D50<sub>Al</sub>/D<sub>B</sub> exceeds 0.02, the steel ball grinding media are so small in relation to the raw material aluminum powder that the grinding power which is correlated with the mass of each steel ball of the grinding media is insufficient, and the raw material aluminum powder cannot be flaked efficiently. Therefore, the brightness of the paint film tends to decrease.</p>
    <heading id="h-00016-en">&lt;Mass ratio between raw material aluminum powder and grinding media&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In the production method of the present invention, while the ratio (W<sub>B</sub>/W<sub>Al</sub>) between the mass (W<sub>B</sub> (g)) of the grinding media and the mass (W<sub>Al</sub> (g)) of the raw material aluminum powder at the time of flaking (grinding) is not particularly limited, it is preferably within the range from 20 to 200. If the ratio is less than 20, the productivity tends to decrease. If the ratio exceeds 200, the grinding time is very long, and the slurry viscosity increases too much during the grinding, resulting in that the efficiency of flaking tends to decrease.</p>
    <heading id="h-00017-en">&lt;Organic solvent containing aromatic hydrocarbon as main ingredient&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In the production method of the present invention, an organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient is used as the grinding solvent.</p>
    <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In producing aluminum flakes and an aluminum flake paste, an organic solvent called mineral spirit containing an aliphatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient is generally used as a grinding solvent. On the other hand, the present invention is characterized in that aluminum flakes that give higher brightness than those obtainable by conventional methods can be obtained by using, as the grinding solvent, an organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient in place of the mineral spirit.</p>
    <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">That is, the production method of the present invention advantageously allows production of an aluminum flake paste having high brightness. This is attributable to the fact that by using, as the grinding solvent, the organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient, the powdering impact applied to the aluminum flakes from the grinding media is weakened, and tearing of the aluminum flakes is less likely to occur.</p>
    <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The wording "containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient" means containing greater than or equal to 50% by mass of an aromatic hydrocarbon in the mass of the whole organic solvent. More preferably, greater than or equal to 70% by mass, further preferably greater than or equal to 90% by mass, or the whole of the organic solvent may be the aromatic hydrocarbon.</p>
    <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Although the kind of the aromatic hydrocarbon is not particularly limited, generally, those having a high boiling point greater than or equal to 120Â°C are preferably used for the safety reason including inflammability to the grinding solvent. Non-limitative examples of a usable aromatic hydrocarbon include 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, xylene, cumene, and naphthalene. It may have a substituent such as a nitro group or a halogen group.</p>
    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient in the production method of the present invention, that also contains other organic solvents, can be used as far as it contains an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient.</p>
    <heading id="h-00018-en">&lt;Ratio between mass of raw material aluminum powder and volume of organic solvent containing aromatic hydrocarbon as main ingredient&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In the production method of the present invention, although the ratio (W<sub>Al</sub>/W<sub>sol</sub> (kg/L)) between the mass (W<sub>Al</sub> (kg)) of the raw material aluminum powder and the volume (W<sub>sol</sub> (L)) of the organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient is not particularly limited, it preferably ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 kg/L, and more preferably ranges from 0.14 to 0.20 kg/L. If W<sub>Al</sub>/W<sub>sol</sub> is less than 0.1 kg/L, the slurry viscosity at the time of flaking is low, and the grinding impact of the grinding media on the raw material aluminum powder is weakened due to the presence of the excessive organic solvent, and the efficiency of flaking decreases. Accordingly, the raw material aluminum powder tends not to be flaked uniformly. On the other hand, if W<sub>Al</sub>/W<sub>sol</sub> exceeds 0.3 kg/L, the slurry viscosity at the time of grinding is too high, and motion of the grinding media is restrained, so that the raw material aluminum powder tends not to be flaked uniformly.</p>
    <heading id="h-00019-en">&lt;Grinding aid&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In the production method of the present invention, it is preferred to conduct flaking of the raw material aluminum powder in the presence of a grinding aid. As the grinding aid, those conventionally known can be used without particular limitation. For example, a fatty acid such as oleic acid or stearic acid, an aliphatic amine, a fatty acid amide, an aliphatic alcohol and an ester of a fatty acid and an aliphatic alcohol can be preferably used.</p>
    <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Such a grinding aid has the effect of inhibiting unnecessary oxidation of the surface of the aluminum flakes and improving the brightness of the aluminum flake paste. While the amount of the grinding aid added at the time of flaking (grinding) is not particularly limited, it is preferably within the range from 0.1 to 20 parts by mass, more preferably within the range from 0.5 to 10 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the raw material aluminum powder. If the amount of the grinding aid added is less than 0.1 part by mass, aluminum flakes can aggregate, and the brightness of the aluminum flake paste can decrease. In addition, insufficient lubricity in flaking the raw material aluminum powder can cause tearing of the aluminum flakes, and a consequent decrease in brightness. On the other hand, if the amount of the grinding aid added exceeds 20 parts by mass, the physical properties of the paint, especially the adhesion properties can be deteriorated. Moreover, the raw material aluminum powder are difficult to be flaked, and the grinding time can be disadvantageously elongated.</p>
    <heading id="h-00020-en">&lt;Separation of aluminum flakes&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In the first step, after obtaining the aluminum flakes by flaking the raw material aluminum powder, for collecting the aluminum flakes, a solid-liquid separation operation such as a filtering operation or a screening operation may be conducted. For example, the flaking (grinding) can be followed by an operation of washing out the slurry containing the aluminum flakes in the ball mill with mineral spirit and subjecting it to a vibration screen, and solid-liquid separating the passing slurry by a pan filter to give aluminum flakes (as a filter cake, in this case). The term "filter cake" used herein refers to a semi-solid substance that remains after removal of the organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon. In the filtering operation or the screening operation, grinding media can be removed from the organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon.</p>
    <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The filtering operation or the screening operation can be appropriately conducted in each of the later-described steps without limited to the first step.</p>
    <heading id="h-00021-en">&lt;Solvent replacement or solvent addition&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In the first step, after obtaining the aluminum flakes by flaking the raw material aluminum powder, the organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient may be replaced by a different solvent by solvent replacement or solvent addition. At this time, the organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient can be changed to a solvent having lower solubility with respect to a later-described "organic compound having a polar group". This makes it possible to further suppress dissolution of the organic compound having a polar group in the solvent in the later-described second step. As will be described later, although the organic compound having a polar group has an effect of improving the storage stability of the aluminum flake paste regardless of whether it is adhered to the surface of the aluminum flakes or it is contained in the solvent, it is more preferred that the organic compound is adhered to the surface of the aluminum flakes from the view point of further improving the storage stability. Accordingly, by changing the solvent, it is possible to suppress dissolution of the organic compound having a polar group in the solvent, and to increase the adhesion amount to the surface of the aluminum flakes, and thus to improve the effect of protecting the surface of the aluminum flakes.</p>

    <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The second step of the production method of the present invention is a step of treating the aluminum flakes obtained in the first step with an organic compound having a polar group, and forming the treated flakes into a paste. The wording "treat with an organic compound having a polar group" used herein refers to a step intended to adhere the organic compound having a polar group to the surface of the aluminum flakes. When the second step is executed in the condition that a paste-forming solvent is added to the aluminum flakes, the organic compound having a polar group may be contained in the paste-forming solvent while it is adhered to the surface of the aluminum flakes. Hereinafter, raw materials, conditions and so on used in the second step will be described.</p>
    <heading id="h-00023-en">&lt;Organic compound having polar group&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In the second step of the production method of the present invention, an operation of treating the aluminum flakes obtained in the first step with an organic compound having a polar group is conducted.</p>
    <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">When an organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient is used as a grinding solvent, solubility in fatty acids such as oleic acid and stearic acid is higher in comparison with the case where an aliphatic hydrocarbon (typically mineral spirit) is used as a grinding solvent. Fatty acids such as oleic acid and stearic acid are added as a grinding aid at the time of flaking (grinding), and adhere to the surface of the aluminum flakes after formation of flakes to play roles of imparting parallel alignment to the aluminum flakes, inhibiting aggregation, and protecting the surface of the aluminum flakes. However, increased solubility in the grinding solvent results in reduction in the amount of fatty acids adhered to the surface of the aluminum flakes. Accordingly, aggregation occurs with the lapse of time, and hence the storage stability of the aluminum flake paste deteriorates. However, by treating the aluminum flakes obtained in the first step with an organic compound having a polar group in the production method of the present invention, it is possible to improve the storage stability of the aluminum flake paste.</p>
    <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">That is, the production method of the present invention shows the excellent effect that an aluminum flake paste having excellent storage stability can be obtained. This is because by treatment with an organic compound having a polar group, aggregation of the aluminum flakes in the aluminum flake paste is inhibited.</p>
    <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">As described above, the organic compound having a polar group has the effect of improving the storage stability regardless of whether it is adhered to the surface of the aluminum flakes or it is contained in the paste-forming solvent. However, for improvement of the storage stability, it is more preferred that the organic compound having a polar group is adhered to the surface of the aluminum flakes.</p>
    <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The organic compound having a polar group for use in the production method of the present invention is an organic compound having a polar group such as a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, an amino group, an amide group (amide bond), or an ester group (ester bond), however, its chemical structure is not particularly limited. Preferably, at least one organic compound selected from the group consisting of a fatty acid, an aliphatic amine, a fatty acid amide, an aliphatic alcohol, and an ester of a fatty acid and an aliphatic alcohol can be used. The organic compound having a polar group may be the same or different from the compound that is added as a grinding aid in the first step.</p>
    <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Examples of the fatty acid include caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and behenic acid.</p>
    <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Examples of the aliphatic amine include lauryl amine, myristyl amine, palmityl amine, and stearyl amine.</p>
    <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Examples of the fatty acid amide include lauric acid amide, palmitic acid amide, oleic acid amide, stearic acid amide, and behenic acid amide.</p>
    <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Examples of the aliphatic alcohol include capryl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, and behenyl alcohol.</p>
    <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Examples of the ester of a fatty acid and an aliphatic alcohol include methyl laurate, methyl oleate, methyl stearate, octyl stearate, isopropyl myristate, butyl stearate, octyl palmitate, octyl oleate, and isopropyl palmitate.</p>
    <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Among these, fatty acids, aliphatic amines, fatty acid amides, aliphatic alcohols and esters of fatty acids and aliphatic alcohols each having greater than or equal to 12 carbon atoms are preferred. By using an organic compound having greater than or equal to 12 carbon atoms, it is possible to further heighten the storage stability. The organic compound more preferably has greater than or equal to 14 carbon atoms.</p>
    <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">While the amount of the organic compound having a polar group for use in the second step is not particularly limited, it is preferably within the range of greater than or equal to 0.5 part by mass and less than or equal to 20 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the aluminum flakes. If this amount is less than 0.5 part by mass, the effect of improving the storage stability of the aluminum flake paste is poor, and the brightness can be decreased due to deterioration in storage stability with the lapse of time. If the aforementioned amount exceeds 20 parts by mass, adhesion properties of a paint film when the aluminum flakes are blended in a paint can be impaired.</p>
    <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Non-limitative examples of the operation method of treating the aluminum flakes with an organic compound having a polar group include a method of adhering an organic compound having a polar group to the surface of the aluminum flakes by bringing the powdery or pasty aluminum flakes into contact with the organic compound having a polar group or mixing the powdery or pasty aluminum flakes with the organic compound having a polar group. When the second step is conducted in the condition that the aluminum flakes are contained in the solvent, a method of adding the organic compound having a polar group at the same time or after dispersing the aluminum flakes in a large amount of solvent in the form of a slurry, to adhere the organic compound having a polar group to the surface of the aluminum flakes can be mentioned. When the powdery or pasty aluminum flakes are used without being dispersed in a solvent, non-limitative examples of the method for contacting and mixing include a method of mixing a paste by means of a kneading machine such as a kneader mixer. In both of the cases where the powdery or pasty aluminum flakes are used without being dispersed in a solvent, and where they are dispersed in a solvent, it is possible to bring the organic compound having a polar group into contact with the aluminum flakes at a higher concentration in comparison with the case where the organic compound having a polar group is added as a grinding aid at the time of flaking in the first step. Therefore, it is possible to adhere the organic compound having a polar group to the surface of the aluminum flakes more efficiently.</p>
    <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Although the organic compound having a polar group has the effect of improving the storage stability of the aluminum flake paste regardless of whether it is adhered to the surface of the aluminum flakes or it is contained in the solvent, it is more preferably adhered to the surface of the aluminum flakes to improve the storage stability. Therefore, by efficiently adhering the organic compound having a polar group to the surface of the aluminum flakes, it is possible to improve the storage stability of the aluminum flake paste.</p>
    <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">While the time for treating the aluminum flakes with the organic compound having a polar group is not particularly limited, it preferably ranges from 5 minutes to 10 hours both in the case of using the powdery or pasty aluminum flakes without being dispersed in a solvent, and in the case of using the aluminum flakes dispersed in a solvent. It is advantageous to select this range in the points that each of the aluminum flakes is uniformly treated, the storage stability is improved, and the brightness of the flakes can be retained.</p>
    <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">In the case of using a solvent in the treatment of the aluminum flakes with the organic compound having a polar group, the kind of the solvent is not particularly limited. For example, a polar solvent such as water, an alcohol, or an ether may be used, and a nonpolar solvent such as an aromatic hydrocarbon or an aliphatic hydrocarbon may be used. However, for avoiding the influence of corrosion by the solvent on the aluminum flakes, a nonpolar solvent is preferably used.</p>
    <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">As such a nonpolar solvent, an aliphatic hydrocarbon or an aromatic hydrocarbon having a boiling point approximately ranging from 120Â°C to 250Â°C, or a mixture thereof can be preferably used. Non-limitative concrete examples thereof include normal paraffin, isoparaffin, xylene, sorbent naphtha, kerosene, mineral spirit, and petroleum benzine.</p>
    <heading id="h-00024-en">&lt;Forming into a paste&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The term "forming into a paste" used in the second step of the present invention refers to elevating the viscosity of the slurry containing the aluminum flakes in the first step (when the aluminum flakes are obtained as a filter cake, transforming it into a fluid of high viscosity). This operation is typically conducted by adding a paste-forming solvent. However, when the viscosity of the mixed system is high in the treatment by adding the organic compound having a polar group to the aluminum flakes, the solvent that forms the mixed system is regarded as a paste-forming solvent, and there is no need to add a paste-forming solvent separately. When the viscosity of the mixed system is low in the treatment by adding the organic compound having a polar group to the aluminum flakes, the viscosity of the mixed system can be elevated by adding a paste-forming solvent to the mixed system, or by replacing the solvent that forms the mixed system with a paste-forming solvent.</p>
    <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The term "paste-forming solvent" used herein refers to a compound to be mixed with aluminum flakes for paste forming. The paste-forming solvent may be the organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient used in the first step. Alternatively, when the second step involves a solvent, the solvent may be directly used as the paste-forming solvent, or any other solvent may be used as a paste-forming solvent by solvent addition or solvent replacement as described above. Non-limitative examples of the material that can be used for the paste-forming solvent include a glycol ether solvent as well as an aliphatic hydrocarbon (e.g., mineral spirit) and an organic solvent containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a main ingredient. While the content of the paste-forming solvent in the aluminum flake paste is not particularly limited, it is preferably greater than or equal to 15% by mass and less than or equal to 50% by mass in the point that the storage stability can be improved, and the dispersibility of the aluminum flakes in a paint can be improved in producing the paint. It is more preferably greater than or equal to 25% by mass and less than or equal to 40% by mass.</p>

    <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">In the production method of the present invention, an operation of adding an antioxidant may be included.</p>
    <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">If the grinding aid such as a fatty acid or the organic compound having a polar group adhered to the surface of the aluminum flakes has an unsaturated double bond in its structure, it has such a nature that it can be denatured or polymerized (transformed) due to radical reaction. This transformation can cause aggregation of the aluminum flakes, and adversely influence on the parallel arrangement of the aluminum flakes to deteriorate the brightness.</p>
    <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">Such transformation can be stopped or inhibited by adding an antioxidant.</p>
    <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The stage in the production process at which the operation of adding an antioxidant is to be conducted can be appropriately determined according to the kinds of the grinding aid and the organic compound having a polar group added to the aluminum flakes. Concretely, when the one having an unsaturated double bond in its structure that easily causes radical reaction, e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid is used as the grinding aid, an antioxidant should be added during flaking in the first step. When the one having an unsaturated double bond in its structure that easily causes radical reaction is used as the organic compound having a polar group in the second step, an antioxidant should be added during the second step or after completion of the second step.</p>

    <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">The aluminum flake paste of the present invention can contain a paste-forming solvent as well as aluminum flakes. Letting the water covering area (cm<sup>2</sup>/g) of the whole of the aluminum flakes contained in the aluminum flake paste be A, and the circularity of the aluminum flakes having a surface area greater than or equal to 250 Âµm<sup>2</sup> be B, the ratio A/B is greater than or equal to 6000 (cm<sup>2</sup>/g). Such an aluminum flake paste can be prepared by the method for producing an aluminum flake paste as described above.</p>

    <heading id="h-00028-en">&lt;Aluminum flakes&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">The composition of the aluminum flakes is identical to the composition of the raw material aluminum powder in the aforementioned method for producing an aluminum flake paste. That is, the composition of the aluminum flakes is not particularly limited, and the aluminum flakes may be composed exclusively of aluminum, or may be composed of an aluminum-based alloy. Also the purity of the aluminum is not particularly limited, however, for further increasing the gloss of a paint film or a printed matter containing the aluminum flake paste, pure aluminum is generally preferred, and pure aluminum having a purity greater than or equal to 99.9% by mass is more preferred.</p>
    <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">While the content of the aluminum flakes in the aluminum flake paste is not particularly limited, a content greater than or equal to 50% by mass and less than or equal to 85% by mass with respect to the aluminum flake paste is preferred because the effect of improving the storage stability and improving the dispersibility of the aluminum flakes in a paint at the time of producing a paint is obtained. More preferably, the content is greater than or equal to 60% by mass and less than or equal to 75% by mass.</p>
    <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">The aluminum flakes of the present invention include aluminum flakes having a surface area greater than or equal to 250 Âµm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <heading id="h-00029-en">&lt;Ratio between circularity and water covering area of aluminum flakes&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">In the aluminum flake paste of the present invention, letting the water covering area (cm<sup>2</sup>/g) of the whole of the aluminum flakes contained in the aluminum flake paste be A, and the circularity of the aluminum flakes having a surface area greater than or equal to 250 Âµm<sup>2</sup> be B, it is required that the ratio A/B is greater than or equal to 6000 (cm<sup>2</sup>/g).</p>
    <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Here, the circularity is a measure that indicates how approximate to a perfect circle the shape of the surface having the largest area of aluminum flakes is. A perfect circle is indicated by a circularity of 1, and the circularity moves away from 1 as the shape moves away from a perfect circle.</p>
    <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">The circularity of the aluminum flakes having a surface area greater than or equal to 250 Âµm<sup>2</sup> can be determined in the following manner. Specifically, vanish (trademark: "Autoclear," available from NIPPONPAINT Co., Ltd.) is added to the aluminum flake paste (solid content: 0.2 g) and stirred, and the obtained paint composition is applied to a hiding power test paper by means of a one-mill doctor blade, to give a painted chart. Then, after drying the painted chart, a picture of aluminum flakes is taken by a digital microscope (trademark: "VHX-1000," available from KEYENCE Corporation), and aluminum flakes having a surface area greater than or equal to 250 Âµm<sup>2</sup> are selected by image analysis measurement processing software (trademark: "Image-Pro Plus version 4.0," available from Planetron, Inc.). The circularity is measured for all of the selected flakes, and an average value thereof is adopted to calculate the circularity of the aluminum flakes having a surface area greater than or equal to 250 Âµm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">While the range of the circularity of the aluminum flakes having a surface area greater than or equal to 250 Âµm<sup>2</sup> contained in the aluminum flake paste of the present invention is not particularly limited, a circularity closer to 1 is preferred. A more preferred circularity is greater than or equal to 1.0 and less than or equal to 1.8.</p>
    <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">The value of the water covering area (WCA) depends not only on the aluminum flakes having a surface area greater than or equal to 250 Âµm<sup>2</sup>, but also on the properties of the whole of the aluminum flakes contained in the aluminum flake paste. The water covering area can be determined according to JIS K 5906:1998 after conducting a predetermined preliminary treatment (collect the aluminum flake paste on a glass filter, wash the paste four times with hexane, and dry the paste) on the aluminum flake paste. While the method of measuring a water covering area described in JIS is for those of the leafing type, the aluminum flake paste of the present invention also includes those of the non-leafing type. Accordingly, in the method of measuring a water covering area in the present invention, the sample of the aluminum flakes is preliminarily treated with a solution of 5% stearic acid in mineral spirit (leafing treatment). The measurement is conducted in the same manner as in the case of the leafing type described in JIS K 5906:1998 except that this preliminary treatment is conducted.</p>
    <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">While the range of the water covering area is not particularly limited, it is preferably greater than or equal to 5000 cm<sup>2</sup>/g and less than or equal to 800000 cm<sup>2</sup>/g, more preferably greater than or equal to 6000 cm<sup>2</sup>/g and less than or equal to 50000 cm<sup>2</sup>/g. This range is advantageous in terms of brightness. If this value is less than 5000 cm<sup>2</sup>/g, the hiding power of the aluminum flake paste is small, and a disadvantage can arise in improving the brightness. If the value exceeds 800000 cm<sup>2</sup>/g, although the aluminum flakes have hiding power, they are too thin in conducting grinding, tearing of the aluminum flakes is more likely to occur, and a disadvantage can arise in improving the brightness.</p>
    <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">In the aluminum flake paste of the present invention, letting the water covering area (cm<sup>2</sup>/g) of the whole of the aluminum flakes contained in the aluminum flake paste be A, and the circularity of the aluminum flakes having a surface area greater than or equal to 250 Âµm<sup>2</sup> be B, the ratio A/B is greater than or equal to 6000 (cm<sup>2</sup>/g), and preferably greater than or equal to 6500 (cm<sup>2</sup>/g). While the upper limit of the ratio A/B is not particularly limited, the ratio is preferably less than or equal to 30000 (cm<sup>2</sup>/g) because the nature of the aluminum flake paste is sufficiently approximate to that of a perfect circle, and the brightness increases.</p>
    <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">The aluminum flake paste of the present invention imparts high brightness because each particle of the aluminum flakes has a shape that is approximate to a perfect circle in contrast with the conventional aluminum flake paste having a comparable water covering area. Although the reason why the aluminum flakes having a shape approximate to a perfect circle impart the high brightness is not clear, one supposable reason is that the aluminum flake paste contains less aluminum flakes having such a shape that the circularity is far from 1 as a result of tearing at the time flaking (grinding) the aluminum flakes because a lot of aluminum flakes have a shape approximate to a perfect circle.</p>
    <heading id="h-00030-en">&lt;Average particle size, average thickness and aspect ratio of aluminum flakes&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">The average particle size of the aluminum flakes of the present invention can be determined by calculating the volume average from the particle size distribution measured by a laser diffraction method. While the average particle size of the aluminum flakes of the present invention is not particularly limited, it is preferably greater than or equal to 1 Âµm and less than or equal to 50 Âµm. Within this range, advantageously, the brightness can be further improved, and there is no fear that the appearance is impaired because the aluminum flakes are less likely to project from the paint film containing the aluminum flake paste. This is particularly desired in automobile applications or the like. The average particle size of the aluminum flakes is more preferably greater than or equal to 3 Âµm and less than or equal to 20 Âµm, further preferably greater than or equal to 5 Âµm and less than or equal to 15 Âµm.</p>
    <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">The average thickness (Âµm) of the aluminum flakes of the present invention is calculated according to the following formula from the measurement of water covering area (WCA) per 1 g of aluminum flakes.

    <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">Here, the reason for using 2.5 (g/cm<sup>3</sup>) is as follows. Although the metal density (specific gravity) of aluminum is 2.7 (g/cm<sup>3</sup>), when the aluminum flakes are arranged, there is a gap between these aluminum flakes because the aluminum flakes have a shape approximate to a circle, and hence 2.5 (g/cm<sup>3</sup>) rather than 2.7 (g/cm<sup>3</sup>) is used as a correction value.</p>
    <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">While the average thickness of the aluminum flakes of the present invention obtained in the manner as described above is not particularly limited, it is preferably greater than or equal to 0.01 Âµm and less than or equal to 5 Âµm. An average thickness within this range is more advantageous in terms of brightness. On the other hand, an average thickness less than 0.01 Âµm is disadvantageous in terms of circulation, and an average thickness exceeding 5 Âµm leads the problem that in a paint film containing the aluminum flake paste, the aluminum flakes project from the paint film to impair the appearance. The average thickness of the aluminum flakes is more preferably greater than or equal to 0.03 Âµm and less than or equal to 1 Âµm.</p>
    <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">The aluminum flakes for use in the present invention preferably have a shape coefficient obtainable by dividing the average particle size by the average thickness (referred to as "aspect ratio") greater than or equal to 50 and less than or equal to 200. This range is more advantageous in terms of the brightness. The aspect ratio is more preferably greater than or equal to 60 and less than or equal to 150.</p>

    <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">The amount of the organic compound having a polar group contained in the aluminum flake paste is represented in terms of the amount of carbon. As a method for measuring the amount of carbon, a method of measuring the amount of carbon contained in the aluminum flake paste by means of an adhered carbon analyzing device (trademark: "K0918," available from Kojima Seisakusho Inc.) can be employed. Concretely, a certain amount of the aluminum flake paste is weighed, and dried to give powdery aluminum flakes. Then, the obtained powdery aluminum flakes are subjected to the adhered carbon analyzing device and the amount of carbon is measured, and thus measurement can be conducted.</p>

    <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">In the method for producing an aluminum flake paste described above, the surface of the aluminum flakes is treated with an organic compound having a polar group in the second step. Therefore, the organic compound having a polar group is adhered to the surface of the aluminum flakes in the finally obtained aluminum flake paste.

    <p id="p-00135-en" num="0135">The circularity of aluminum flakes in each of the aluminum flake pastes obtained in Examples 1 to 9, Reference Example 1 and Comparative Examples 1 to 10 was determined in the following manner. More specifically, varnish (trademark: "Autoclear," available from NIPPONPAINT Co., Ltd.) was added to each aluminum flake paste (as 0.2 g of solid content) obtained in examples and comparative examples so that the total weight was 50 g, and the mixture was stirred by a stirring deaerator (trademark: "MAZERUSTAR," available from KURABO INDUSTRIES LTD.) to give a paint composition. Then, the obtained paint composition was applied to a hiding power test paper (trademark: "Hiding power test chart," available from T.P GIKEN) by means of a 1 mil doctor blade, and dried to give a painted chart. Subsequently, a picture of aluminum flakes in the painted chart was taken by a digital microscope (trademark: "VHX-1000," available from KEYENCE Corporation). Subsequently, by image analyzing the picture of the aluminum flakes by using image analysis measurement processing software (trademark: "Image-Pro Plus version 4.0," available from Planetron, Inc.), the surface area and the circularity of every aluminum flake were measured. Among all of the measured aluminum flakes, aluminum flakes having a surface area greater than or equal to 250 Âµm<sup>2</sup> were selected, and an average value of the circularity of the aluminum flakes having a surface area greater than or equal to 250 Âµm<sup>2</sup> was determined. The results are shown in Table 1.</p>

The measurement result of average particle size of aluminum flakes is shown in Table 1. The average particle size of aluminum flakes in this context corresponds to the average particle size "directly after preparation" in the later-described evaluation of storage stability.</p>

    <p id="p-00144-en" num="0144">Storage stability of the aluminum flake pastes obtained in Example 1, Examples 5 to 9, Reference Example 1 and Comparative Example 1 was examined in the following manner. Specifically, for an aluminum flake paste directly after preparation, the particle size distribution of aluminum flakes was measured. Then, the aluminum flake paste was stored at a constant-temperature room at 50Â°C for three months, and the particle size distribution of aluminum flakes in the aluminum flake paste after storage was measured. Then, the particle size distribution of aluminum flakes directly after preparation was compared with the particle size distribution of aluminum flakes after storage for three months.</p>
    <p id="p-00145-en" num="0145">The aforementioned particle size distribution was measured by using a laser diffraction type particle size distribution measuring device (trademark: "Micro Track HRA," available from Honeywell International Inc.), and the particle size of D50 was determined.

Specifically, 2.0 g by solid content of an aluminum flake paste was weighed on a glass filter. Then, the glass filter was set in an aspiration bottle, and the paste was dispersed with a glass rod while 40 mL of n-hexane was added to give a dispersion. Subsequently, the dispersion was allowed to pass through the glass filter by aspiration, and thus filtered and washed. Then, the operation of adding n-hexane and dispersing the paste, and washing the dispersion by aspiration was repeated four times to give a powder of aluminum flakes. Subsequently, 1.0 g of the obtained powder of aluminum flakes was added to a 100-mL beaker together with 2 mL of 5% by mass stearic acid solution in mineral spirit, and dispersed with a glass rod. Then, 50 mL of mineral spirit was added, and warmed at 45Â°C for 2 hours in an oven. Then, the solution was filtered by aspiration through another glass filter. Subsequently, n-hexane was added, followed by dispersion, aspiration for 1 hour, and drying to give a measurement sample.</p>
    <p id="p-00147-en" num="0147">Subsequently, on a small watch glass from which the oil on the surface was removed, about 0.02 to 0.03 g of the above measurement sample was collected. For 0.001 g of the measurement sample, butyl alcohol was dropped several times (about 0.02 mL per one drop) and the sample was dispersed with a glass rod. The watch glass on which the measurement sample resides was dipped under the liquid surface of a trough filled with water. Then, by stirring the liquid level with a glass rod so that the film of the aluminum flakes on the liquid surface of the trough was uniform, a uniform film of aluminum flakes was allowed to form. Then, the outer circumference of the film of aluminum flakes (concretely, the lengths of the upper side, the lower side and the lateral side) was measured by a measuring scale, and water covering area (WCA) of aluminum flakes was calculated according to the following formula. <maths id="maths-00003-en" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">WCA</mi><mspace width="1em" /><mfenced separators=""><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">cm</mi></mrow><mrow><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></mrow></msup><mo>/</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">g</mi></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mfenced open="[" close="]" separators=""><mfenced open="{" close="}" separators=""><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">length of upper side of film of aluminum flakes</mi><mspace width="1em" /></mrow><mfenced><mi mathvariant="normal">cm</mi></mfenced><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">length of lower side of film of aluminum flakes</mi><mspace width="1em" /></mrow><mfenced><mi mathvariant="normal">cm</mi></mfenced></mfenced><mo>Ã</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">length of lateral side of film of aluminum flakes</mi><mspace width="1em" /></mrow><mfenced><mi mathvariant="normal">cm</mi></mfenced><mo>/</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn></mfenced><mo>/</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">sample amount</mi><mspace width="1em" /><mfenced><mi mathvariant="normal">g</mi></mfenced></mrow></math><img id="img-00003-en" wi="144" he="21" img-content="math" file="imgb0003.tif" img-format="tif" /></maths></p>

    <p id="p-00153-en" num="0153">As is apparent from Table 1, regarding the storage stability, the difference between directly after preparation and after three-months storage was less than or equal to 3% in any of Example 1, Examples 5 to 9 and Comparative Example 1. Moreover excellent storage stability of the obtained aluminum flake paste was confirmed not only in the case where a fatty acid was used as the organic compound having a polar group as in Examples 1, 5, 7, and 8, but also in the case where an aliphatic alcohol was used as in Example 6 and in the case where an aliphatic amine was used as in Example 9.</p>
    <p id="p-00154-en" num="0154">Further, as is apparent from Table 1, comparing the aluminum flake pastes obtained in Examples 5, 7, and 8 which are different in the preparation method only in that the fatty acids used as the organic compound having a polar group in the second step have different numbers of carbon atoms, regarding the storage stability, the difference between directly after preparation and after three-months storage was 2.3% in Example 8 in which capric acid having 10 carbon atoms was used, whereas the difference between directly after preparation and after three-months storage was less than 2.0% in Example 5 in which oleic acid having 18 carbon atoms was used and in Example 7 in which lauric acid having 12 carbon atoms was used. Therefore, it is revealed that an excellent result of storage stability showing a difference between directly after preparation and after three-months storage of less than 2% can be obtained by a fatty acid having greater than or equal to 12 carbon atoms.</p>
    <p id="p-00155-en" num="0155">On the other hand, in the aluminum flake paste obtained in Reference Example 1 in which an organic compound having a polar group was not added in the second step, the difference between directly after preparation and after three-months storage was as large as 8.1%. Therefore, it is supposed that the storage stability is poor and aggregation occurs due to temporal change.</p>
    <p id="p-00156-en" num="0156">Therefore, it was confirmed that the aluminum flake paste of the present invention shows excellent storage stability.</p>
    <p id="p-00157-en" num="0157">It is apparent from Table 1 and <figref>Fig. 1</figref> that Examples 1 to 9 have ratios A/B greater than or equal to 6000 (cm<sup>2</sup>/g), and Comparative Examples 1 to 10 have ratios A/B of less than 6000 (cm<sup>2</sup>/g). Therefore, it was confirmed that the aluminum flake paste prepared by the method for producing an aluminum flake paste of the present invention has a ratio A/B greater than or equal to 6000 (cm<sup>2</sup>/g).</p>
    <p id="p-00158-en" num="0158">As is apparent from Table 1 and <figref>Fig. 2</figref>, for a fixed water covering area (WCA) in Examples 1 to 4 and Comparative Examples 1 to 10 (comparison at the same numerical water covering area), Examples 1 to 4 showed more excellent brightness than Comparative Examples 1 to 10. Therefore, it was confirmed that the aluminum flake paste of the present invention shows excellent brightness.</p>
