      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which occurs gradually, resulting in memory loss, behavior disturbances, personality changes and a decline in cognitive abilities; it is also the most common cause of dementia among the elderly. Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that cholinergic functions in the basal forebrain and cortex decline due to senile dementia during AD. While there are no successful treatments currently available to stop its degenerative progress, a promising therapeutic strategy for activating the cholinergic functions has been the use of cholinomimetic agents such as donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, tacrine, and memantine, each approved for human use by the FDA. With the exception of memantine, all are potent, reversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7). Use of these drugs is limited in utility, however, due to adverse side-effects, such as hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal disturbance, and problems with bioavailability. For this reason, research efforts aimed at improving the pharmacological profile of the prototypes continue.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">AChE contains a narrow and deep active site gorge with two sites of ligand binding—an acylation site (or A-site) at the base of the gorge and a peripheral site (or P-site) near the gorge entrance. The P-site contributes to the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme by transiently binding substrates on their way to the acylation site, where a short-lived acyl enzyme intermediate is produced (Johnson et al., <i>Biochem. </i>42:5438-5452 (2003)). The P-site, spanned by residues W286 (hAChE) near the mouth of the gorge and D74 (hAChE) near a constriction at the boundary between the P-site and the A-site, specifically binds fluorescent probe Thioflavin T (De Ferrari et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>276: 23282-23287 (2001)). Thioflavin T, a benzothiazole-based fluorophore widely used to detect amyloid structure in proteins, binds selectively to the AChE P-site with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 1.0 μM. Donepezil (donepezil hydrochloride, trade name: Aricept®, E2020, CAS #120014-06-4, 2-(1-benzyl-piperidin-4-ylmethyl)-5,6-dimethoxy-indan-1-one), is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with IC<sub>50 </sub>of 15 nM (hAChE), 26 nM (EeAChE) and 7273 nM (BuChE) (Hyatt et al., <i>Chem. Biol. Interact. </i>157-158:247-252 (2005); and Camps et al., <i>J. Med. Chem. </i>51:3588-3598 (2008)). Thioflavin T appears to be a dual-site binding AChE inhibitor interacting with both A- and P-sites of AChE. New compound types capable of binding A- and P-sites incorporating thiazole heterocycles as a motif could improve selectivity toward AChE and thereby improve therapeutic utility against neurodegenerative diseases and disorders.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The primary molecular target of organophospate nerve agents, whether weaponized or used as insecticides, is AChE. As nerve agents may inhibit other enzymes and because the receptors for acetylcholine (muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) are widely expressed, these agents can impact a number of biological processes. In addition to well-known CNS effects, vascular and inflammatory effects of nerve agents include vasoconstriction, an increase in blood brain barrier permeability, as well as modulation of lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production. Exposure to organophosphates used in weapons or insecticides can result in significant morbidity or death. Present treatment of organophosphate poisoning consists of post-exposure intravenous or intramuscular administration of various combinations of drugs, including carbamates (e.g., pyridostigmine), anti-muscarinics (e.g., atropine), and ChE-reactivators such pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM). Novel inhibitors of AChE that block the binding of organophosphates can be used as prophylactic treatments for patients (e.g., a human, such as soldier or farmer) at risk for exposure to an organophosphate insecticide or chemical agent.</p>

Certain compounds of the present invention may also exist as prodrugs, as described in <i>Hydrolysis in Drug and Prodrug Metabolism: Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Enzymology</i>, Testa, Bernard and Wiley-VHCA, Zurich, Switzerland 2003. Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are structurally modified forms of the compound that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compound. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compound by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to a compound when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the compound, or parent drug. They may, for instance, be bio-available by oral administration whereas the parent drug is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. A wide variety of prodrug derivatives are known in the art, such as those that rely on hydrolytic cleavage or oxidative activation of the prodrug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug is a compound that is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”), but then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity. Additional examples include peptidyl derivatives of a compound.</p>

      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0098">While it may be possible for the compounds of the invention to be administered as the raw chemical, it is also possible to present them as a pharmaceutical formulation. Accordingly, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug or solvate thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and optionally one or more other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. Any of the well-known techniques, carriers, and excipients may be used as suitable and as understood in the art; e.g., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured in a manner that is itself known, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or compression processes.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0099">The formulations include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarticular, and intramedullary), intraperitoneal, transmucosal, transdermal, rectal and topical (including dermal, buccal, sublingual and intraocular) administration although the most suitable route may depend upon for example the condition and disorder of the recipient. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug or solvate thereof (“active ingredient”) with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0100">Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0101">Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include tablets, push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol.

Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with binders, inert diluents, or lubricating, surface active or dispersing agents. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0102">The compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in powder form or in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or sterile pyrogen-free water, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0103">Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous (oily) sterile injection solutions of the active compounds which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0104">In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds of the invention may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0105">For buccal or sublingual administration, the compounds of the invention may take the form of tablets, lozenges, pastilles, or gels formulated in conventional manner.

Alternatively, for administration by inhalation or insufflation, the compounds according to the invention may take the form of a dry powder composition, for example a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. The powder composition may be presented in unit dosage form, in for example, capsules, cartridges, gelatin or blister packs from which the powder may be administered with the aid of an inhalator or insufflator.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0111">Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing an effective dose, as herein below recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0112">It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0113">The compounds of the invention may be administered orally or via injection at a dose of from 0.1 to 500 mg/kg per day. The dose range for adult humans is generally from 5 mg to 2 g/day. Tablets or other forms of presentation provided in discrete units may conveniently contain an amount of compound of the invention which is effective at such dosage or as a multiple of the same, for instance, units containing 5 mg to 500 mg, usually around 10 mg to 200 mg.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0114">Compounds according to the invention can be administered at a daily dose of about 0.001 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg of body weight, in 1 to 3 dosage intakes. Further, compounds can be used systemically, at a concentration generally of between 0.001% and 10% by weight and preferably between 0.01% and 1% by weight, relative to the weight of the composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0115">The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0116">The compounds of the invention can be administered in various modes, e.g. orally, topically, or by injection. The precise amount of compound administered to a patient will be the responsibility of the attendant physician. The specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diets, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the precise disorder being treated, and the severity of the indication or condition being treated. Also, the route of administration may vary depending on the condition and its severity.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0117">In certain instances, it may be appropriate to administer at least one of the compounds of the invention described herein (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or prodrug thereof) in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the compounds herein is hypertension, then it may be appropriate to administer an anti-hypertensive agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein may be enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant may only have minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit of experienced by a patient may be increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. By way of example only, in a treatment for pain involving administration of one of the compounds described herein, increased therapeutic benefit may result by also providing the patient with another therapeutic agent for pain. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient may simply be additive of the two therapeutic agents or the patient may experience a synergistic benefit.</p>

The starting materials (4-vinylpyridines 1 and benzothiazoles 2) are relatively inexpensive or easily accessible, and reagents and conditions are mild.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0124">The method of synthesis for compounds of the invention is as follows: To a mixture of 4-vinylpyridine (1, 2.5 mmol) and substituted 2-amino-benzothiazoles (2, 2.5 mmol) in ethanol (3 mL) was added Amberlyst-15 (20% w/w with respect to vinylpyridine). The reaction mixture was refluxed at 90-100° C. for 24 h. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and the catalyst was filtered off Solvent evaporation and further purification by silica gel column chromatography using hexane/ethyl acetate solvent system yielded 4-(benzothiazol-2-yl)-aminoethyl pyridines 3. These substituted aminoethylpyridines (3, 1 mmol) and the alkylating agent (1.5 mmol) in acetone (20 mL) were stirred at 60-80° C. for 4-5 h. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, the precipitate collected, washed with acetone (3×20 mL), dried under vacuum to get desired compounds 4a-4e. All compoundswere characterized by <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, ESI-MS and HRMS.</p>

      <heading id="h-00015-en" level="1">Binding Affinity/Docking Studies</heading>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0125">Docking studies were performed using the program AutoDockVina version 1.0.2 (http://vina.scripps.edu) software. Acetylcholinesterase structure (AChE-E2020 complex) was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org); the PDB ID was LEVE. Ligand structures were drawn using ChemDraw Ultra; energy was minimized using MM2 and MOPAC jobs in Chem3D ultra and saved in .pdb format. AutoDockTools (ADT) version 1.5.4 (http://mgltools.scripps.edu) was used for protein and ligand preparation. Since the positions of most of the water molecules in the crystal structure of AChE-E2020 are unlikely to be conserved, water molecules were removed before docking Hydrogen atoms were added to all amino acids. Kollman charges for all atoms in AChE were assigned by using AutoDock Tools. The search and scoring grid for Autodock was centered in the cavity. The docking site for the ligands on 1EVE was defined by establishing a cube at the geometrical center of the native ligand E2020 (Donepezil). The torsional bonds of ligands were set free by Ligand module in ADT. The structures were then saved in PDBQT file format, for input into AutoDockVina. All computations were carried out on a MacBook.Ligands are ranked based on an energy scoring function and, to speed up the score calculation, a grid-based protein-ligand interaction is used. The docking results from each calculationwere clustered on the basis of root-mean square deviation (RMSD) between the Cartesian coordinates of the ligand atoms andwere ranked according to the binding free energy.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0126">Docking studies revealed the conformation and orientation of the ligand 1-(4-fluoro-benzyl)-4-[2-(6-nitro-benzothiazol-2-yl)-aminoethyl]-pyridinium bromide 4e in the AChE binding site. Like donepezil, ligand 1-(4-fluoro-benzyl)-4-[2-(6-nitro-benzothiazol-2-yl)-aminoethyl]-pyridinium bromide 4e also spans the entire aromatic gorge of AChE. It interacts with peripheral anionic site residues Tyr70 and Trp279 as well as with the ammonium binding site residues Trp84, Phe330 and Asp72, and phenyl group binding residues Trp84 and Phe330 (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
