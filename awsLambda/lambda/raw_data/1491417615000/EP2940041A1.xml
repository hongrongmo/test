    <heading id="h-00001-en">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a modified laminin containing a collagen binding molecule; an extracellular-matrix material, a culture substrate, a scaffold each comprising the modified laminin; and a method for cell culture using the modified laminin.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Stem cells, in particular pluripotent stem cells such as ES cells and iPS cells, are receiving worldwide attention for their potential application to regenerative medicine. The culture and maintenance of stem cells without loss of their pluripotency usually requires the presence of feeder cells in their culture system, and as such feeder cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) whose division has been arrested by radiation or antibiotic treatment are used. However, the use of feeder cells is a great restriction on clinical application of human stem cells.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">For application of human stem cells to regenerative medicine, a feeder-free (no feeder cells are used) and xeno-free (no xenogeneic components are contained in the culture system) culture environment is required. The present inventors previously found that recombinant human laminins (particularly, laminin 332, which consists of α3, β3 and γ2 chains, and laminin 511, which consists of α5, β1 and γ1 chains) are effective for maintaining the pluripotency of human ES cells (see Non Patent Literature 1), and proposed that a recombinant human laminin E8 fragment or a modified laminin in which a cell adhesion molecule and/or a growth factor binding molecule is conjugated to the recombinant human laminin E8 fragment can be used as an extracellular matrix which enables maintenance culture of stem cells while supporting the retention of their pluripotency (see Patent Literature 1 and 2 and Non Patent Literature 2).</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Following the maintenance culture of human stem cells, they should be differentiated to form a three-dimensional tissue structure for their application to regenerative medicine. In the case where cells isolated from a tissue are made to form a three-dimensional tissue structure, a conventionally used extracellular matrix is Matrigel (registered trademark), the trade name for a crude extract of mouse EHS sarcoma, which is known for excessive production of basement membrane components. However, Matrigel is of murine origin and thus is problematic in terms of safety for human use. Collagen gel is also widely used as an extracellular matrix for the three-dimensional culture system, but when collagen gel is used alone, the formation of a three-dimensional tissue structure from human stem cells is hardly achieved due to its poor ability to maintain stem cells. That is, under the current circumstances, there is no appropriate extracellular-matrix material to serve as an alternative to Matrigel for the formation of a three-dimensional tissue structure. Therefore, the speedy development of extracellular-matrix materials for the formation of a safe three-dimensional tissue structure for regenerative medicine in humans is strongly desired.</p>

    <heading id="h-00012-en">&lt;Modified laminin&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The present invention provides a modified laminin characterized in that a laminin or a heterotrimeric laminin fragment has a collagen binding molecule conjugated to at least one site selected from the α chain N-terminus, the β chain N-terminus and the γ chain N-terminus.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Laminins are heterotrimeric molecules consisting of three subunits termed α, β and γ chains. Five kinds of α chains (α1 to α5), three kinds of β chains (β1 to β3) and three kinds of γ chains (γ1 to γ3) are known, and various combinations of these chains result in at least 12 kinds of laminin isoforms (see Table 1) . The laminin which constitutes the modified laminin of the present invention may be any of these isoforms. That is, the laminin or the heterotrimeric laminin fragment which constitutes the modified laminin of the present invention consists of one kind of α chain selected from α1 to α5 or a fragment thereof, one kind of β chain selected from β1 to β3 or a fragment thereof, and one kind of γ chain selected from γ1 to γ3 or a fragment thereof. Specifically, the 12 kinds of isoforms shown in Table 1 and all the other possible isoforms and fragments thereof can preferably be used. Preferred are laminin α5β1γ1 or a fragment thereof, laminin α3β3γ2 or a fragment thereof, laminin α1β1γ1 or a fragment thereof, laminin α1β2γ1 or a fragment thereof, laminin α2β2γ1 or a fragment thereof, laminin α2β2γ1 or a fragment thereof, laminin α3β1γ1 or a fragment thereof, laminin α3β2γ1 or a fragment thereof, laminin α4β1γ1 or a fragment thereof, laminin α4β2γ1 or a fragment thereof, and laminin α5β2γ1 or a fragment thereof.

    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The origin of the laminin is not particularly limited and laminins derived from various organisms can be used. Preferred are laminins derived from mammals, including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, cattle and pigs. Among these, a human laminin is particularly preferably used. In the culture of human stem cells for preparation of materials for human regenerative medicine, a xeno-free (no xenogeneic components are contained in the culture system) environment is required, and for this reason, a human laminin is preferably used.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The laminin which constitutes the modified laminin of the present invention may be a full-length laminin or a fragment thereof. That is, the laminin may be a full-length laminin consisting of a full-length α chain, a full-length β chain and a full-length γ chain, or a laminin fragment consisting of α, β and γ chains of which one or more are fragments shorter than the corresponding full-length chains. The laminin fragment needs to be in the form of a heterotrimer, and preferably has integrin binding activity. The heterotrimer formation of the laminin fragment can be confirmed from, for example, the number of bands detected by SDS-PAGE. The integrin binding activity of the laminin fragment can be confirmed by a solid phase binding assay etc.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The laminin fragment which constitutes the modified laminin of the present invention needs to be in the form of a heterotrimer consisting of α, β and γ chains, but the molecular weight etc. of the laminin fragment are not particularly limited. In terms of the strength of the integrin binding activity and the efficiency of recombinant expression (the recombinant protein yield is higher in comparison with that of a full-length laminin), a laminin E8 fragment is preferred. The laminin E8 fragment was identified as a fragment having the strongest cell adhesion activity among the fragments obtained by elastase digestion of mouse laminin α1β1γ1 (hereinafter referred to as "mouse laminin 111") (Edgar D., Timpl R., Thoenen H. The heparin-binding domain of laminin is responsible for its effects on neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival. <nplcit id="ncit-00003" npl-type="s"><text>EMBO J., 3: 1463-1468, 1984</text></nplcit>; and <nplcit id="ncit-00004" npl-type="s"><text>Goodman SL., Deutzmann R., von der Mark K. Two distinct cell-binding domains in laminin can independently promote nonneuronal cell adhesion and spreading. J. Cell Biol., 105: 589-598, 1987</text></nplcit>). It is presumed that elastase digestion of laminins other than mouse laminin 111 could produce fragments corresponding to the mouse laminin 111 E8 fragment, but there is no report on isolation or identification of such fragments. Therefore, the laminin E8 used in the present invention does not have to be an elastase-digested product of laminins, and may be any laminin fragment having the cell adhesion activity, structure and molecular weight equivalent to those of mouse laminin 111E8.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The laminin may be a native laminin or a mutant laminin that has a modification(s) of one or more amino acid residues but retains the biological activities of the native laminin. The method for producing the laminin is not particularly limited. For example, the laminin can be obtained by purification from highly laminin-expressing cells. Alternatively, the laminin can be produced as a recombinant protein. The method for producing the laminin fragment is not particularly limited either. For example, the laminin fragment can be obtained by digestion of a full-length laminin with a protease such as elastase, followed by isolation and purification of the fragment of interest. Alternatively, the laminin fragment can be produced as a recombinant protein. In terms of production quantity, quality uniformity, production cost, etc., it is preferred that the laminin and the laminin fragment are produced as a recombinant protein.</p>

The culture method of the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and can also preferably be used for culture of mammalian cells other than human iPS cells. (1) Collection of human iPS cells from co-culture system with feeder cells</p>
    <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Human iPS cells are collected from a co-culture system with feeder cells according to the following method 1 or 2.</p>

    <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">To a culture dish in which human iPS cells have been co-cultured with feeder cells (for example, MEFs) (Day 3 to Day 5), 0.25% trypsin/DMEM-F12 (for example, 1 ml/60 mm dish) is added, and incubation was performed at 37°C for 2 to 3 minutes. The culture dish is washed with DMEM-F12 and thereby feeder cells are removed. A culture medium is added to the culture dish and the cells on the entire culture dish are physically detached. By filtering the resulting cell suspension through a BD Falcon 100-µm cell strainer (BD Falcon #352460) and subsequently washing the strainer, only human iPS cell colonies are separated and collected.</p>
    <heading id="h-00018-en">Method 2:</heading>
    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">To a culture dish in which human iPS cells have been co-cultured with feeder cells (for example, MEFs) (Day 3 to Day 5), a cell detachment solution (for example, Dissociation Solution for ES/iPS Cells (RCHETP002, ReproCELL Inc.), 1 mg/ml dispase/DMEM-F12, 10 mg/ml collagenase IV/DMEM-F12, etc.) (for example, 1 ml/60 mm dish) is added, and incubation was performed at 37°C for 5 minutes to detach the human iPS cells and the MEFs from the culture dish. The detached cells are transferred into a 15-ml centrifuge tube. To this tube, about 10 ml of a culture medium is added, the cells are suspended, the tube is left to stand for 5 minutes to allow only the colonies to sediment, and then the supernatant is removed. By repeating this procedure twice or more, only human iPS cell colonies are sedimented and collected.</p>

    <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The collected human iPS cell colonies are dissociated into single cells. The method for dissociating the colonies into single cells is not particularly limited, and the examples include trypsinization and also include several times of flushing in a culture medium using a Pipetman P-1000 or the like. The dissociated single cells are resuspended in an appropriate culture medium (for example, TeSR2 etc.), and seeded on a culture dish coated with, for example, collagen and the modified laminin. The culture is performed in a CO<sub>2</sub> concentration suitable for the culture medium used, and the culture medium is replaced daily.</p>

    <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Cultured cells are passaged at the time when the space available for cell expansion becomes limited or cell death becomes noticeable in the colonies. In the culture method of the present invention, passage may be performed by seeding human iPS cells in the state of properly-sized colonies, as in conventional methods. Alternatively, passage may be performed by seeding human iPS cells in a dissociated single-cell state. Here, the "dissociated single-cell state" means not only a state in which all the cells in a cell suspension are present as single cells, but also a state in which some cells in a cell suspension are present as single cells and other cells therein are present in an aggregate form of about several cells to a little more than ten cells.</p>

The human iPS cell colonies are dissociated into single cells, for example, by several times of flushing in a culture medium using a Pipetman P-1000 or the like. After addition of a culture medium, the human iPS cells are suspended and then collected in a centrifuge tube.

These results showed that the type I collagen binding activities of the forms with two or more CBDs (divalent or higher valent forms) were higher by approximately one order of magnitude than those of the forms with a single CBD (monovalent forms). However, no difference was found between the divalent form and the trivalent form. In addition, CBD-E8 (αβ), which contained CBDs fused to both the α5 and β1 chains, CBD-E8 (αγ), which contained CBDs fused to both the α5 and γ1 chains, had binding activities equivalent to that of CBD-E8 (βγ) (data not shown) .</p>

The PBS on the plate was aspirated off and the iPS cells were seeded on the plate at 1 ml/well. The plate was placed in an incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C for cell culture. The duration of the cell culture was 3 days, during which the culture medium was replaced daily.</p>

    <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">The images of the iPS cells on day 3 of culture under type I collagen-coating conditions are shown in <figref>Fig. 4</figref>. As is clear from <figref>Fig. 4</figref>, the iPS cells hardly proliferated when seeded on the plate coated only with type I collagen (indicated as "Col I only" in the figure). Similarly, the iPS cells hardly proliferated when seeded on the plate coated additionally with the CBD-free LN511-E8 (indicated as "+511E8" in the figure). However, when the plates were coated additionally with the LN511-E8 fused with a single CBD (indicated as "+CBD-E8 (β)" and "+CBD-E8 (γ)" in the figure), the iPS cells slightly proliferated. On the plate coated additionally with the LN511-E8 fused with two CBDs (indicated as "+CBD-E8 (βγ)" in the figure), the number of iPS cells was greater than those observed on the plates coated additionally with the LN511-E8 fused with a single CBD.</p>

The iPS cells only slightly proliferated on the plate coated only with gelatin (indicated as "Gelatin only" in the figure), and the same was the case on the plate coated additionally with the CBD-free LN511-E8 (indicated as "+511E8" in the figure) . When the plates were coated additionally with the LN511-E8 fused with a single CBD (indicated as "+CBD-E8 (β) " and "+CBD-E8 (γ)" in the figure), proliferation of the iPS cells was observed. On the plate coated additionally with the LN511-E8 fused with two CBDs (indicated as "+CBD-E8 (βγ)" in the figure), the number of iPS cells was greater than those observed on the plates coated additionally with the LN511-E8 fused with a single CBD.</p>
