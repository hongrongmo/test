      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to Michael acceptor-terminated urethane-containing prepolymers and compositions thereof for use in sealant applications. The prepolymers provide compositions that exhibit room temperature stability and a controlled curing rate following a brief activation.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Sealants useful in aerospace and other applications must satisfy demanding mechanical, chemical, and environmental requirements. The sealants can be applied to a variety of surfaces including metal surfaces, primer coatings, intermediate coatings, finished coatings, and aged coatings.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Michael addition curing chemistries are often used in acrylic-based polymer systems and, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,138,573, have also been adapted for use in polysulfide compositions. Application of Michael addition curing chemistries to sulfur-containing polymers not only results in cured sealants having faster curing rates and enhanced performance including fuel resistance and thermal resistance, but also provides sealants with improved physical properties such as elongation. The use of Michael addition curing chemistries for sulfur-containing polymer compositions useful in aerospace sealant applications is disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 13/529,237, filed on Jun. 21, 2012, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The compositions disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 13/529,237 employ one or more base catalysts such as amine catalysts. In the presence of a suitable base such as 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene (DBU) or 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) or a C<sub>6-10 </sub>primary amine, the thiol-Michael addition reaction is fast and the cure time is typically less than 2 hours. Without a suitable base catalyst, the Michael addition reaction between, for example, a thiol-terminated polythioether and a Michael acceptor is slow providing a pot life, depending on the temperature, of several days to weeks. However, the physical properties of the cured composition are less than desired for certain applications. The reaction mechanisms for thiol-Michael addition reactions are disclosed by Chan et al., <i>Macromolecules </i>2010, 43, 6381-6388.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In practice, the foregoing compositions can be provided as two-part formulations in which the thiol-terminated compound and the Michael acceptor are provided as separate components, with the amine catalyst in one or both components, and the two parts mixed shortly prior to use. For example, if the catalytic amine is a tertiary amine, the amine catalyst may be in one or both components, and if the catalytic amine is a primary or secondary amine, the amine catalyst can only be included in the component containing the thiol-terminated compound. Alternatively, the base catalyst may be provided as a third component, and the component containing the thiol-terminated compound, the component containing the Michael acceptor, and the component containing the base catalyst and the three components combined and mixed shortly before use. However, once the components are mixed, the Michael addition reaction proceeds and, depending at least in part on the temperature and on the type of amine catalyst, the pot life is limited to less than 2 hours. Furthermore, as the composition starts to cure, there is little ability to control the reaction rate to take advantage of the complex chemistries taking place after the sealant is applied to a surface. Amine catalyzed systems such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,179 typically cure within 2 hours to 12 hours and although exhibiting acceptable fuel resistance and thermal resistance for many aerospace sealant applications, a longer pot life such as from 24 hours to 72 hours and improved performance of the cured product is desirable.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Compositions having extended pot life and a controlled curing rate can be realized by using a controlled release amine catalyst. In these systems, an amine catalyst such as a strong base or primary amine that produces a fast reaction rate is protected or encapsulated and dispersed in a composition. Upon exposure, for example, to ultraviolet radiation, moisture, or temperature, the catalytic amine is released and catalyzes the Michael addition reaction. In certain embodiments, such systems provide a pot life greater than 2 hours to 12 hours and cure within 24 to 72 hours after the useful working time. Controlled release amine catalysts have been used as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 13/659,152 filed on Oct. 24, 2012, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Use of controlled release catalysts can provide cure on demand systems. Although the performance of cured sealants prepared using controlled release amine-catalyzed Michael addition curable sulfur-containing polymer compositions is acceptable for many aerospace sealant applications, improved properties such as increased tensile strength is desired.</p>

      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">For purposes of the following description, it is to be understood that embodiments provided by the present disclosure may assume various alternative variations and step sequences, except where expressly specified to the contrary. Moreover, other than in the examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing, for example, quantities of ingredients used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term âabout.â Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties to be obtained. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard variation found in their respective testing measurements.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Also, it should be understood that any numerical range recited herein is intended to include all sub-ranges encompassed therein. For example, a range of â1 to 10â is intended to include all sub-ranges between (and including) the recited minimum value of about 1 and the recited maximum value of about 10, that is, having a minimum value equal to or greater than about 1 and a maximum value of equal to or less than about 10. Also, in this application, the use of âorâ means âand/orâ unless specifically stated otherwise, even though âand/orâ may be explicitly used in certain instances.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">A dash (â-â) that is not between two letters or symbols is used to indicate a point of covalent bonding for a substituent or between two atoms. For example, the chemical group âCONH<sub>2 </sub>is covalently bonded to another chemical moiety through the carbon atom. In certain instances, the expression â-*â is used to denote the point of bonding.</p>
