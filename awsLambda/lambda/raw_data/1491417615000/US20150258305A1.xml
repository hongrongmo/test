      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a medical device. More particularly, the invention pertains to a catheter for draining urine from a bladder. Specifically, the invention provides a catheter having an opening at a first end and a sidewall that is free of eyelets, and wherein the catheter is configured to drain urine from a patient's bladder faster than conventional catheters.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Background Information</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Urinary catheters are extremely useful medical devices. Generally, a urinary catheter is inserted into the urethral canal of a patient to drain urine from the bladder when they need assistance urinating. Current catheter designs have a catheter body sidewall with two to four eyelets or intake apertures formed in the catheter body sidewall at one end and often a hemispheric tip enclosing one end to facilitate insertion into a urethral canal. The eyelets are known to those in the urology field to cause trauma to the urethra. During insertion, the edges of the eyelets can cut the urethra wall, similar to the way a box grater or box shredder cuts a piece of cheese, often leading to serious infections requiring extreme medical attention.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Improvements on this basic design have come and gone through the years, such as smoother and polished eyelet designs to decrease the risk of infection often attributed to insertion agitation. Yet, these catheters still have drawbacks. Slow drainage time is often a problem because the eyelet formed in the catheter body sidewall causes turbulent fluid forces within the catheter. Further, friction forces created by the urine flow contacting the inner surface of the catheter decreases the fluid flow or drainage rate. The eyelets also have a likelihood of becoming clogged with mucus or debris contained in the bladder, or clogged with lubricant used during the insertion process.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Inasmuch as drawbacks continue to exist with respect to currently known intermittent urinary catheters as detailed by way of background above, there is a need in the art for an improved catheter that addresses some or all of the drawbacks of the currently known designs. The present invention addresses some of these issues.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In one aspect, an embodiment may provide an improved catheter that has a single entrance opening located at the first end instead of the two to four eyelets formed in the sidewall of conventional catheters. Further, the improved catheter maintains a faster flow rate with one entrance opening than the flow rate of a conventional catheter having two eyelets. The improved catheter is structurally strong enough to allow the entrance opening to be introduced first into the urethral canal without the need for a tip.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In one aspect, an embodiment may provide a catheter comprising: a generally cannular body having an annular sidewall with first and second ends that therebetween define an longitudinal axis, said first end adapted to be inserted into a urethral canal; said body having an outer surface spaced apart from an inner surface; a lumen defined by the inner surface adapted to drain the fluid from a bladder; and a single entrance opening defined in the first end wherein a plane of the opening intersects the longitudinal axis.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In another aspect, another embodiment may provide a catheter comprising: a body having an annular sidewall extending along a longitudinal axis between first and second ends, said body having an outer surface spaced apart from an inner surface; a lumen defined by the body extending longitudinally from first end to second end adapted to drain fluid from a hollow organ; and an entrance opening formed in the first end in longitudinal alignment with the lumen and including an entrance opening plane intersecting the axis in a generally perpendicular manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In another aspect, another embodiment may provide a catheter comprising: a catheter having first and second ends with a generally cannular body extending therebetween along a longitudinal axis; said body having an outer surface spaced apart from an inner surface; said inner surface having a non-circular cross section when viewed from above; a lumen defined by the non-circular inner surface adapted to drain fluid from a hollow organ; and an entrance opening formed in the first end in fluid communication with the lumen.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In yet another aspect, an embodiment may provide a method for draining a human bladder comprising the steps of: providing a catheter having an annular sidewall with first and second ends that therebetween define a longitudinal axis, and having an entrance opening defined in the first end of the body; wherein a plane of the opening intersects the longitudinal axis; aligning the first end of the catheter body with the entrance to a patient's urethral canal; inserting the first end of the catheter into the urethral canal; moving the catheter through the urethral canal towards the patient's bladder; establishing fluid communication between the catheter and the bladder; causing urine to flow from the bladder through the entrance opening; through a lumen defined in the catheter, where the lumen is longitudinally aligned with the entrance opening; through an aperture defined in the second end of the catheter body, where the aperture is longitudinally aligned with the lumen; and into a drainage tube engaged with the second end of the catheter body; draining a quantity of urine from the bladder; and removing the catheter after the quantity of urine has drained from the bladder.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Still further, an embodiment may provide an intermittent urinary catheter comprising: a generally flexible tubular body member defining a lumen extending centrally along a longitudinal axis from a first end to a second end, said first end adapted to be inserted into a urethral canal of a patient; an outer surface spaced apart from an inner surface of the tubular member, wherein the inner surface defines the lumen adapted to drain the fluid from the patient's bladder; and a plurality of distinct longitudinally extending convex surfaces positioned circumferentially about the longitudinal axis collectively defining the outer surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In another aspect, an embodiment may provide an intermittent urinary catheter comprising: a generally flexible tubular body member defining a lumen extending centrally along a longitudinal axis from a first end to a second end, said first end adapted to be inserted into a urethral canal of a patient; an outer surface spaced apart from an inner surface of the tubular member, wherein the inner surface defines the lumen adapted to drain the fluid from the patient's bladder; an entrance opening formed adjacent the first end of the of the tubular body member in fluid communication with the lumen; and an enlarged tip formed adjacent the first end of the tubular body member, the enlarged tip having a diameter greater than that of the tubular body member, said enlarged tip adapted to guide the intermittent urinary catheter through the urethral canal.</p>

      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">With primary reference to <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a catheter <b>10</b> as conventionally known in the PRIOR ART has a first end <b>12</b>, a second end <b>14</b>, a catheter body or annular sidewall <b>16</b> extending from first end <b>12</b> to second end <b>14</b>, eyelets <b>18</b>, a first end wall <b>20</b> at the first end <b>12</b> that forms a tip which is hemispheric in shape and substantially continuous, a sidewall outer surface <b>22</b>, a sidewall inner surface <b>24</b>, and a lumen <b>26</b> defined by inner surface <b>24</b>. Catheter body <b>16</b> is generally cannular or tubular extending from first end <b>12</b> to second end <b>14</b> and defining therebetween a longitudinal axis X<sub>pa</sub>. Eyelets <b>18</b> are formed in the catheter sidewall extending from a start plane S<sub>pa </sub>along outer surface <b>22</b> to and end plane E<sub>pa </sub>along inner surface <b>24</b> proximate the first end <b>12</b>. The respective start and end planes, S<sub>pa</sub>, E<sub>pa</sub>, of the eyelets are parallel to longitudinal axis X<sub>pa</sub>. When viewed from a side cross section (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>) and extrapolated beyond the respective start and end planes, S<sub>pa</sub>, E<sub>pa</sub>, eyelets <b>18</b> are at right angles to the longitudinal axis X<sub>pa</sub>. Eyelets <b>18</b> are in fluid communication with lumen <b>16</b> permitting fluid to drain through catheter <b>10</b> and out and exit opening (not shown) defined in the second end <b>14</b>, which may be configured to fluidly communicate with a drainage tube or system (not shown). End wall <b>20</b> intersects longitudinal axis X<sub>pa </sub>and is substantially solid and continuous. However, there are some known prior art catheters <b>10</b> that may contain a small or âpin-holeâ opening within end wall <b>20</b>, wherein this pin-hole opening has a substantially smaller diameter than the lumen <b>16</b> diameter. The outer and inner surfaces <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> of the catheter sidewall <b>16</b> are smooth. One exemplary PRIOR ART catheter is commercially known as the Cure Catheterâ¢ 14 Fr., model number M405F1406, manufactured for and distributed by Cure Medical, LLC of Newport Beach, Calif.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The embodiments of the catheter of the present invention are identified using reference number <b>30</b>A in <figref>FIGS. 4A-6B</figref>, <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B, and <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>B; reference number <b>30</b>B in <figref>FIGS. 7A-9B</figref>, <b>12</b>, and <b>15</b>; reference number <b>30</b>C in <figref>FIGS. 10A-10C</figref>, <b>13</b>, and <b>16</b>; reference number <b>30</b>D in <figref>FIGS. 17A-19C</figref>; reference numeral <b>30</b>E in <figref>FIG. 20</figref>; reference numeral <b>30</b>F in <figref>FIG. 21</figref>; reference number <b>30</b>G in <figref>FIG. 24</figref>; reference number <b>30</b>H in FIG.-<b>25</b>; and reference number <b>30</b>I in <figref>FIG. 26</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">As will be further described herein, first embodiment catheter <b>30</b>A has a sidewall <b>36</b> that it of a substantially constant diameter from the first end of the catheter to the second end thereof. Second embodiment catheter <b>30</b>B has a truncated tear-drop shaped first end; and third embodiment catheter <b>30</b>C has a plurality of dimples on the outer surface of the catheter sidewall. Each embodiment may be configured so that a lumen defined in the catheter has any of five different interior surface configurations, each of which having a unique cross section.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">With primary reference to <figref>FIGS. 4A-6B</figref>, catheter <b>30</b>A has a catheter body or sidewall <b>36</b> (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>) comprising a top or first end <b>32</b>, a bottom or second end <b>34</b> (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>), a first or right side <b>31</b>, a second or left side <b>33</b>, and an entrance opening <b>38</b> defined by the first end <b>32</b>. Sidewall <b>36</b> has an outer surface <b>40</b> and an inner surface <b>42</b>. A lumen <b>44</b> is defined by inner surface <b>42</b> and lumen <b>44</b> extends from first end <b>32</b> to second end <b>34</b> along a longitudinal axis X. First end <b>32</b> to second end <b>34</b> therebetween define a longitudinal direction. Right side <b>31</b> to left side <b>33</b> therebetween defines a radial direction. Catheter sidewall <b>36</b> is generally cannular or tubular and extends longitudinally, having a substantially constant outer diameter OD<b>1</b> from first end <b>32</b> to second end <b>34</b> centered about longitudinal axis X as seen in device <b>30</b>A of <figref>FIGS. 4A-5B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, entrance opening <b>38</b> is defined by catheter sidewall <b>36</b> at the first end <b>32</b>. Entrance opening <b>38</b> is a radial, inwardly tapering, through-opening which intersects the longitudinal axis X. Entrance opening <b>38</b> extends longitudinally from a tapered start plane TS to a tapered end plane TE. Tapered start plane TS is a radially extending plane at the top end of a tapered annular surface <b>46</b>. Tapered end plane TE is a radially extending plane at the bottom end of surface <b>46</b>. Entrance opening <b>38</b> is radially bound by surface <b>46</b>. Preferably, planes TS, TE of entrance opening <b>38</b> intersect longitudinal axis X perpendicularly, however other angled relationships are contemplated. Entrance opening <b>38</b> has a diameter (ID<b>1</b>, ID<b>2</b>â<figref>FIG. 4A</figref>) that is substantially the same as the diameter (ID<b>1</b>, ID<b>2</b>â<figref>FIG. 4B</figref>) of lumen <b>4</b>. Entrance opening <b>38</b> is in longitudinal alignment and in fluid communication with lumen <b>44</b>. The term longitudinally aligned or longitudinal alignment herein refers to the entrance opening being positioned at the first end and permitting fluid to continue along the same path as lumen <b>44</b> without changing directions about longitudinal axis X. Surface <b>46</b> permits fluid to flow down the slope thereof and through entrance opening <b>38</b>. Surface <b>46</b> is disposed at an angle Î± relative to longitudinal axis âXâ. Slope a begins at end wall <b>32</b>A. End wall <b>32</b>A is located at the first end <b>32</b> and comprises a rounded rim that is concentric with opening <b>38</b>. Tapered start plane TS and end plane TE are each disposed at right angles to longitudinal axis X. As seen in <figref>FIGS. 4B</figref>, <b>5</b>B slope Î± is shown at a 45 degree angle relative to tapered start plane TS, however slope Î± may be from about approximately 10 to about approximately 80 degrees relative thereto. Further, the taper of surface <b>46</b> generally requires sidewall thickness <b>37</b> to be approximately 25% greater in device <b>30</b>A than a body thickness of a prior art catheter <b>10</b> having a substantially similar outer diameter.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Inner surface <b>42</b> may have five variations of cross sectional shapes or forms when viewed from the first end. It is to be understood that the five forms disclosed herein can be incorporated into any of the three embodiments of device <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, and <b>30</b>C. In a first form, inner surface <b>42</b> defines a plurality of channels <b>50</b> extending longitudinally and formed within the catheter sidewall <b>36</b>. As seen in <figref>FIGS. 4B</figref>, <b>5</b>B, channels <b>50</b> start in the surface <b>46</b> between the tapered start plane TS and tapered end plane TE. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, channels <b>50</b> are defined by the longitudinally extending recesses <b>52</b>A which are half-moon shaped when viewed from first end, connected along longitudinally extending edges <b>52</b>B.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">In a second form, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the channels <b>50</b> can be defined by a plurality of longitudinally extending half-moon recesses <b>52</b> and arcuate separation sections <b>51</b>. The half-moon recesses <b>52</b> or <b>52</b>A are spaced annularly apart from one another in a manner so as to increase fluid flow through lumen <b>44</b> of catheter <b>30</b>A relative to that of a conventional circular cross-sectional lumen known in the prior art. The separation sections <b>51</b> are generally equally spaced between the half-moon recesses <b>52</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In a third form, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, channels <b>50</b> include at least one section that is straight or planar. In particular, each channel <b>50</b> preferably includes two straight sections that form a generally V-shaped channel defined by longitudinally extending edges <b>54</b> and connected flat panels <b>55</b> forming formed in the inner surface <b>42</b> in the catheter sidewall <b>36</b>. The connected edges <b>54</b> and panels <b>55</b> provide a generally octagonal cross-section. While this embodiment provides a generally octagonal cross-section, yet other geometric shapes capable of being configured by connected edge <b>54</b> and panels <b>55</b> are contemplated. Further alternatively, channels <b>50</b> may be rifled to increase drainage flow rate. The term rifled in this context means channels <b>50</b> may extend concentrically in a helical manner from first end <b>32</b> to second end <b>34</b> along defined by inner surface <b>42</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 4A-5B</figref>, <b>7</b>A-<b>8</b>B sidewall <b>36</b> has an outer diameter shown as OD<b>1</b> extending from right <b>31</b> to left <b>33</b> side of the surface, a first inner diameter shown as ID<b>1</b>, a second inner diameter shown as ID<b>2</b>, and a radial or sidewall thickness <b>37</b>. Sidewall <b>36</b> may alternatively have a third inner diameter ID<b>3</b> and a fourth inner diameter ID<b>4</b> as seen in device <b>30</b>A of <figref>FIGS. 6A-6B</figref> instead of the first and second inner diameters ID<b>1</b>, ID<b>2</b>. Further alternately, sidewall <b>36</b> may have a fifth inner diameter ID<b>5</b> and a sixth inner diameter ID<b>6</b> as seen in device <b>30</b>C of <figref>FIGS. 10A-10C</figref> instead of the first and second inner diameters ID<b>1</b>, ID<b>2</b>. Even further, sidewall <b>36</b> may have a single inner diameter, shown as ID<b>7</b> in device <figref>FIG. 11A-16</figref>. Outer diameter OD<b>1</b> extends from right side <b>31</b> to left side <b>33</b> of outer surface <b>40</b> as viewed from the cross section view in <figref>FIGS. 4B</figref>, <b>5</b>B. As seen in the top view of <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>, first inner diameter ID<b>1</b> extends radially across axis X between arcuate separation sections <b>51</b> and second inner diameter ID<b>2</b> between half-moon recesses <b>52</b>. As shown in the top view of <figref>FIG. 5B</figref>, third inner diameter ID<b>3</b> extends radially across axis X between longitudinally extending panels <b>55</b> and fourth inner diameter ID<b>4</b> extending radially between edges <b>54</b>. As shown in the top view of <figref>FIG. 10A</figref>, fifth inner diameter ID<b>5</b> extends radially across axis X from side to side <b>31</b>, <b>33</b> of inner surface <b>42</b> and sixth inner diameter extends radially across axis X between dimples <b>62</b>. As seen in <figref>FIGS. 4B</figref>, <b>5</b>B, sidewall thickness <b>37</b> extends radially between outer surface <b>40</b> and inner surface <b>42</b>. In any of the embodiment illustrated herein, it will be understood that the diameter of opening <b>38</b> is substantially of the same diameter of the lumen with which it is in fluid communication.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Ordinarily, catheters are characterized by a scale known as the âFrench Sizeâ, each French size having a corresponding outer diameter. For example, a catheter having a French Size <b>4</b> has an outer diameter of 0.053 inches or 1.35 mm. While a French Size <b>8</b> catheter has an outer diameter of 0.105 inches or 2.7 mm. Outer diameter OD<b>1</b> of the present invention is configured to have the same outer diameter as a conventionally known French size.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">With primary reference to <figref>FIGS. 7A-9B</figref>, a second embodiment of catheter <b>30</b>B is shown having a bulbous or truncated teardrop-shaped head <b>56</b> formed in the first end <b>32</b> of the catheter sidewall <b>36</b>. The truncated teardrop-shaped head <b>56</b> extends radially outwardly from longitudinal axis X to provide a second outer diameter OD<b>2</b> that is larger than the outer diameter OD<b>1</b> of sidewall <b>36</b>. Outer surface <b>40</b> extends continuously along truncated teardrop-shaped head <b>56</b> having a first sloped surface <b>40</b>A, an apex surface <b>40</b>B, a second sloped surface <b>40</b>C, and a sidewall surface <b>40</b>D when viewed from the side. As seen in <figref>FIG. 7B</figref>, first sloped surface <b>40</b>A extends a distance from rounded end wall <b>32</b>A flared radially outward from axis X towards second end <b>34</b>. Apex surface <b>40</b>B is positioned below first sloped surface <b>40</b>A when device <b>30</b>B is oriented vertically. Apex surface <b>40</b>B forms an apex from which the outer diameter OD<b>2</b> of head <b>56</b> is determined. Second sloped surface <b>40</b>C extends a distance from apex surface <b>40</b>B flared radially inwards to axis X towards second end <b>34</b>. Sidewall surface <b>40</b>D continues from second sloped surface <b>40</b>C to second end <b>34</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">With continued reference to <figref>FIGS. 7A-9B</figref>, lumen <b>44</b> extends through the truncated teardrop-shaped head <b>56</b> in fluid communication with the entrance opening <b>38</b> as defined by its surface <b>46</b>. Channels <b>50</b> have the same inner diameter extending from the entrance opening <b>38</b> through the truncated teardrop-shaped head <b>56</b> and continuing longitudinally through catheter sidewall <b>36</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">With primary reference to <figref>FIGS. 10A-10C</figref>, the third embodiment catheter <b>30</b>C has a plurality of convexly-shaped dimples <b>60</b> along outer surface <b>40</b>, a plurality of concavely-shaped dimples <b>62</b> along inner surface <b>42</b>, a plurality outer surface retention areas <b>43</b>, a first outer diameter OD<b>1</b>, a second outer diameter OD<b>3</b>, first inner diameter ID<b>5</b>, second inner diameter ID<b>6</b>, in addition to other elements having similar reference numerals as the other embodiments. Catheter <b>30</b>C may have a generally non-circular cross section or textured outer surface <b>40</b> and a generally non-circular cross section or textured inner surface <b>42</b>. Convex dimples <b>60</b> are formed along the outer surface <b>40</b> in the catheter sidewall <b>36</b>. The term convex with respect to dimples <b>60</b> refers to the dimples extending radially out of the catheter sidewall <b>36</b> and the dimple surface facing outward as viewed from above as seen in <figref>FIG. 10A</figref>. Convex dimples <b>60</b> have an outer annular edge <b>60</b>A and an apex <b>60</b>B. Annular edge <b>60</b>A is a generally circular edge disposed where dimple <b>60</b> connects to outer surface <b>40</b> of sidewall <b>36</b>. Apex <b>60</b>B is the apex or radially outermost point of dimple <b>60</b> surface when viewed from a cross-sectional side view, as seen in <figref>FIG. 10C</figref>. Second outer diameter OD<b>3</b> measures radially from right <b>31</b> to left <b>33</b> at mirroring apexes <b>60</b>B. First outer diameter OD<b>1</b> is the outer diameter of outer surface <b>40</b>. Retention areas <b>43</b> are formed along and bound by the outer surface <b>40</b> and the spaces between annular edges <b>60</b>A. Concave dimples <b>62</b> are formed along the inner surface <b>42</b> in catheter sidewall <b>36</b>.

      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0079">As depicted in <figref>FIG. 17A</figref>, all convex surfaces <b>72</b> have the same radius of curvature, however other particular embodiments is possible and may even be desired to have differing radii of curvature associated with different ones of the plurality of convex surfaces <b>72</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0080">First edge <b>78</b> of first convex surface <b>74</b> connects with second edge <b>86</b> of second convex surface <b>76</b> to define a longitudinally extending channel <b>90</b> therebetween. In the embodiment shown in FIG.-<b>17</b>A and FIG.-<b>17</b>B, channel <b>90</b> begins at the first end <b>32</b> of catheter <b>30</b>D and extends towards the second end <b>34</b>. However in some other embodiments, channel <b>90</b> may begin closely adjacent the first end <b>32</b> and extend towards the second end <b>34</b>. Channel <b>90</b> is configured to retain a gel based lubricant therein as catheter <b>30</b>D is advanced through the urethral canal towards the patient's bladder. The lubricant may be applied manually by the patient or in some other embodiments a gel-based lubricant may be pre-packaged inside the catheter packaging such that when the catheter is advanced through an end of the packaging, as it moves through the gel-based lubricant where the gel-based lubricant is retained in channel <b>90</b>.</p>

Thus, while eight channels <b>90</b> are depicted in FIG.-<b>17</b>A, it is to be clearly understood that alternative configurations are entirely possible. For example, the plurality of convex surfaces <b>72</b> may define four channels <b>90</b>, or five channels <b>90</b>, or six channels <b>90</b>, or seven channels <b>90</b>, or nine channels <b>90</b>, or ten channels <b>90</b>, or eleven channels <b>90</b>, or twelve channels <b>90</b>, and so on. Furthermore, catheter <b>30</b>D depicts eight convex surfaces <b>72</b> and eight inner concave channels <b>50</b>. It is to be understood that the number of concave inner channels <b>50</b> does not need to equal the number of convex outer surfaces <b>72</b>. It is entirely possible to have four inner concave channels <b>50</b> and twelve outer convex surfaces <b>72</b> on catheter <b>30</b>D. Similarly, catheter <b>30</b>D may have four outer convex surfaces <b>72</b> and twelve inner concave channels <b>50</b>. Or, any combination therebetween. The optimized configuration of catheter <b>30</b>D is dependent on the French size and the desired flow rate for urine leaving the bladder.</p>

      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0086">As depicted in <figref>FIG. 20</figref>, an embodiment of catheter <b>30</b>E depicts a spherical head <b>104</b> formed adjacent the first end of the tubular body member <b>36</b> wherein the spherical enlarged head <b>104</b> has a diameter greater than that of tubular body <b>36</b>. The enlarged head <b>104</b> on catheter <b>30</b>E is adapted to guide intermittent urinary catheter <b>30</b>E through the urethral canal of a patient.</p>

      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0088">As depicted in <figref>FIG. 24</figref>, an embodiment of catheter <b>30</b>G includes an enlarged head <b>109</b> having a maximum diameter width offset from an imaginary horizontal midline of head <b>109</b>. Stated otherwise, the bulbous head <b>109</b> on catheter <b>30</b>G has its widest point closely adjacent the first end. The head <b>109</b> then tapers inwardly towards the catheter body <b>36</b>.

      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0089">As depicted in <figref>FIG. 25</figref>, an embodiment of catheter <b>30</b>H depicts an enlarged head having a maximum diameter width offset from an imaginary horizontal midline of head <b>111</b>. Stated otherwise, the bulbous head <b>111</b> on catheter <b>30</b>H has its widest point closely adjacent the first end. Head <b>111</b> is more elongated than head <b>109</b>. Head <b>111</b> tapers at a lower tapering angle relative to body <b>36</b> than shown on catheter <b>30</b>G. Head <b>111</b> may be configured to have a plurality of convex sections or portion extending there-along, similar to the other embodiment catheters disclosed above. Further, the interior lumen may be defined by any of the described configurations presented above.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0090">As depicted in <figref>FIG. 26</figref>, an embodiment of catheter <b>30</b>I depicts an end of the catheter body <b>36</b> tapering inwardly (i.e., towards the longitudinally extending center axis). The inwardly tapering end of catheter <b>30</b>I defines an entrance opening <b>112</b> of the intermittent catheter <b>30</b>I having a diameter ID<b>8</b> perpendicularly intersecting the longitudinal axis that is less than the inner diameter ID<b>4</b> of the lumen. The inwardly curving end of catheter <b>30</b>I provides strength to the first end. Further, the opening <b>112</b> having diameter ID<b>8</b> less than inner diameter ID<b>4</b> of lumen may have a venturi-like effect (e.g., increase velocity while decreasing pressure) on the urine draining from the bladder as it enters catheter <b>30</b>I and moves through opening <b>112</b>. Opening <b>112</b> is aligned along the same longitudinal axis as the lumen of catheter <b>30</b>I. Opening <b>112</b> is distinct from a conventional âeyeletâ on a catheter inasmuch as it does not extend radially through the catheter body, rather is defined by an end and extends longitudinally.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0091">In operation, as seen in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the device of the present invention provides a method of draining urine <b>72</b> from a human bladder <b>71</b>. First end <b>32</b> of catheter sidewall <b>36</b> is first inserted into a urethral canal <b>70</b> in a human body until the first end <b>32</b> breaches a sphincter wall <b>73</b>, passes the prostate <b>74</b>, and is placed in fluid communication with the bladder <b>71</b>. Bladder <b>71</b> contents, namely urine <b>72</b>, begin to flow toward the first end <b>32</b>. Urine <b>72</b> then flows via gravitational forces over tapered annular recesses <b>46</b>. Surface <b>46</b> tapers inwardly and this permits the fluid to increase velocity or flow rate and decrease its pressure as it approaches entrance opening <b>38</b>. Urine then passes through entrance opening <b>38</b> and longitudinally into lumen <b>44</b>. As fluid flows through entrance opening <b>38</b>, it contacts the channels <b>50</b>. Channels <b>50</b> decrease surface side wall friction of the fluid <b>72</b> as it exits the bladder <b>71</b>. The channels <b>50</b> on the inner sidewall surface <b>42</b> permit fluid <b>72</b> to drain faster than a conventional catheter having a smooth inner sidewall side wall <b>24</b> as known in the prior art. Fluid exits the lumen <b>44</b> through an exit opening (not shown) at the second end <b>34</b> of the catheter and to enter a drainage funnel <b>45</b>. The catheter <b>30</b> remains in fluid communication with the bladder until all of the urine or a desired quantity of urine has drained out of the exit opening (not shown) provided at second end <b>34</b> of catheter sidewall <b>36</b>. Once all urine has drained completely, the catheter may be extracted by gripping the second end <b>34</b> and extracting the device <b>30</b>A out of the urethral canal <b>70</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0092">One advantage of the present invention <b>30</b> is that it allows all of the urine to drain out of the bladder. Prior art catheters having eyelets <b>18</b> in their sidewalls have been known to not fully drain the bladder as a two eyelet design creates a negative pressure inside the bladder not permitting all urine, fluid or debris contents to drain.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0093">Further, the present invention offers advantages over prior art catheters <b>10</b> in that when a patient is sick, the urine <b>72</b> may become clogged with mucous or other debris. The entrance opening <b>38</b> of the present invention <b>30</b> permits mucous and debris to flow readily into lumen <b>44</b> and through the catheter without getting clogged or stuck. In prior art catheters <b>10</b>, clogging problems with the eyelet <b>18</b> design are known to occur.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0094">Alternative embodiment <b>30</b>B of the present invention operates by first aligning truncated tear drop head <b>56</b> with urethral canal <b>70</b>, then inserting head <b>56</b> into the urethral canal <b>70</b>. The head <b>56</b> outer diameter OD<b>2</b> is generally equal to or slightly larger than the upstretched diameter of the urethral canal <b>70</b>. Catheter <b>30</b>B is manipulated so the truncated tear drop head <b>56</b> advances through the urethral canal <b>70</b> until it is in communication with the bladder <b>71</b>. The head <b>56</b> operates as a guide to navigate the natural curvature often found in the urethral canal <b>70</b> of males.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0095">Alternative embodiment <b>30</b>C operates by the first end <b>32</b> being first inserted into the urethral canal <b>70</b>. The convex dimple apices <b>60</b>B contact the urethral canal <b>70</b> during insertion. The convex dimples <b>60</b> reduce the surface area of the urethral canal <b>70</b> actually contacting the catheter <b>30</b>C. Thus, dimples <b>60</b> reduce irritation often associated with inserting a catheter <b>10</b> having a smooth outer surface. Further, retention areas <b>43</b> retain a lubricant as catheter <b>30</b>C moves through the urethral canal <b>70</b> towards bladder <b>71</b>. An exemplary lubricant is commercially sold as SurgilubeÂ® manufactured by Savage LaboratoriesÂ® a division Fougera Pharmaceuticals, Incorporated, A Sandoz Company, of Melville, N.Y. The eyelets of prior art catheters <b>10</b> have been known to become clogged or partially clogged with lubricant and thus have decreased flow rates. This problem is obviated in the present catheters <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, <b>30</b>E, <b>30</b>F, <b>30</b>G, <b>30</b>H, or <b>30</b>I. Once urine <b>72</b> begins to flow, the dimples <b>62</b> along the inner surface of catheters <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, <b>30</b>E, <b>30</b>F, <b>30</b>G, <b>30</b>H, or <b>30</b>I cause the fluid to drain faster than it normally would over a smooth inner surface. Similar to a dimpled golf ball, the concave dimples permit urine <b>72</b> to pool up in the concave dimple <b>62</b> recesses. This reduces the friction factor of the remaining urine <b>72</b> draining through the lumen permitting it to increase the drainage flow rate while simultaneously permitting laminar flow through the center of the lumen.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0096">While catheters <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, <b>30</b>E, <b>30</b>F, <b>30</b>G, <b>30</b>H, or <b>30</b>I of the present invention provide for a single entrance opening defined in the first end of the annular sidewall, it is to be understood that more than one opening are possible. For example, a cross member can extend across the opening offering more strength and rigidity to the sidewall. This cross member would bisect the entrance opening into two or more openings. It is to be appreciated that these two or more openings would still operate in accordance with the aspects of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0097">Alternative embodiment <b>30</b>D by first aligning truncated tear drop head <b>92</b> (channeled head) or <b>100</b> (smooth head) with urethral canal <b>70</b>, then inserting head <b>92</b> or <b>100</b> into the urethral canal <b>70</b>. The head <b>92</b> (channeled head) or <b>100</b> (smooth head) outer diameter OD<b>2</b> is generally equal to or slightly larger than the upstretched diameter of the urethral canal <b>70</b>. Catheter <b>30</b>D is manipulated so the truncated tear drop head <b>92</b> (channeled head) or <b>100</b> (smooth head) advances through the urethral canal <b>70</b> until it is in communication with the bladder <b>71</b>. The head <b>92</b> (channeled head) or <b>100</b> (smooth head) operates as a guide to navigate the natural curvature often found in the urethral canal <b>70</b> of males, but also works equally well for females. Enlarged heads on catheters <b>30</b>E and <b>30</b>F operate in a similar guiding manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0098">With continued reference to catheter <b>300</b>, convex outer surfaces <b>72</b>, namely their respective apices, contact the urethral canal <b>70</b> as catheter <b>30</b>D is advanced towards the bladder. The apices on convex surfaces <b>72</b> having a greater diameter than reduce the amount of outer surface area directly contacting urethral canal <b>70</b>. Further, lubricant may be retained in channel(s) <b>90</b> to assist in the frictionally reduced gliding advancement of catheter <b>30</b>D.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0099">It is contemplated that catheter sidewall <b>36</b> will be made from a polyvinylchloride thermoplastic having additional plasticizers to make the PVC material soft and flexible for in vivo use, as conventionally known in the art. However, other materials known in the art such as latex or silicone-based derivatives may be substituted as well. Further, it is preferable that sidewall <b>36</b> of urinary catheters <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, <b>30</b>E, <b>30</b>F, <b>30</b>G, <b>30</b>H, or <b>30</b>I will be made wholly of PVC, or otherwise free of a reinforcing member that is a different material. However, there may be instances in which having a reinforced tube, such as a fully encapsulated reinforcing braid, may be advantageous. Further, it is preferable that sidewall <b>36</b> is non-porous so that no bacteria can build up in material recesses, permitting devices <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, <b>30</b>E, <b>30</b>F, <b>30</b>G, <b>30</b>H, or <b>30</b>I to be cleaned or disinfected and reused.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0100">It will be understood that while the catheters <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, <b>30</b>E, <b>30</b>F, <b>30</b>G, <b>30</b>H, or <b>30</b>I have been described herein as being useful for draining a single fluid (i.e. urine) from a patient's bladder during a drainage session, they may also be used in other medical procedures. Catheters <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, <b>30</b>E, <b>30</b>F, <b>30</b>G, <b>30</b>H, or <b>30</b>I may also be used to introduce fluids into a patient's body. Consequently, lumen <b>44</b> is able to permit fluid flow out of a patient's body and into a patient's body. It will further be understood that the fluids in question may be liquids or gases.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0101">As depicted in <figref>FIG. 22</figref>, an alternative internal configuration of any one of the catheters <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, <b>30</b>E, <b>30</b>F, <b>30</b>G, <b>30</b>H, or <b>30</b>I, is provided. A portion of lumen <b>44</b> is defined by longitudinally extending edge <b>54</b>A connecting adjacent flat panel walls <b>55</b>A together. Flat panel walls <b>55</b>A extend towards longitudinal center axis X from their connection with edge <b>54</b>A. Flat panel walls <b>55</b>A contact arcuate wall <b>51</b>. Arcuate wall <b>51</b> has a radius of curvature equal to first inner diameter ID<b>1</b> divided by two. Furthermore, first inner diameter ID<b>1</b> is measured from arcuate wall <b>51</b> through longitudinal axis X to an opposed arcuate wall <b>51</b>. A second inner diameter ID<b>2</b> is measured through longitudinal axis X between opposed longitudinal edges <b>54</b>A. Second inner diameter ID<b>2</b> is greater than first inner diameter ID<b>1</b>. Channels <b>50</b> are defined between flat panel wall <b>55</b>A and have a v-shaped configuration in cross section. The advantage of this configuration is designed to improve fluid flow through lumen <b>44</b> inside a catheter.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0102">As depicted in <figref>FIG. 23</figref>, the inner surface <b>42</b> defining lumen <b>44</b> may be scored with a plurality of score lines <b>110</b> circumferentially disposed about longitudinal axis X. Score lines <b>110</b> extend slightly into the catheter body away from longitudinal axis X. Score lines <b>110</b> help to reduce surface tension of fluid moving through lumen <b>44</b>. In the shown embodiment of <figref>FIG. 23</figref>, score lines <b>110</b> extend longitudinally in a linear manner along the length of the catheter body. However, it is to be clearly understood that the score lines <b>110</b> may helically wind about longitudinal axis X creating a rifling effect of the fluid moving through lumen <b>44</b> inside the catheter. The score lines <b>110</b> are preferably used in association with a catheter having a French size less than about French size <b>10</b>. However, clearly it is contemplated that larger sizes may be used as well. In one particular example, score lines <b>110</b> are provided on a catheter having a French size <b>4</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0103">In the foregoing description, certain terms have been used for brevity, clearness, and understanding. Namely, the term ânon-circular cross sectionâ with reference to the inner or outer surface refers to the annular wall <b>36</b> defining the lumen of the catheter not having a continuous circular extending cross section. Specifically, the inner surface is non-circular because it may contain longitudinally extending straight channels, rifled channels, helical channels, textured dimples, staggered recesses, turbulence reducing molding, or other striations that intentionally break the fluid friction or tension which would ordinarily occur against a smooth inner catheter wall. The term âeyeletlessâ refers to the absence of any eyelet formed in the sidewall of a catheter sidewall as ordinarily understood and used in the prior art; stated otherwise, the term eyeletless refers a catheter annular sidewall that is continuous. The term âdimplesâ or âdimpledâ refers to a plurality of hemispheric recesses formed on a surface. The dimples on the inner surface of the catheter cause a fluid boundary layer entering the lumen from an entrance opening to transition from laminar to turbulent within the hemispheric recess. The turbulent boundary layer within the hemispheric recess is able to remain attached to the inner surface much longer than a purely smooth surface having a laminar boundary and so creates a narrower, low pressure, wake and hence less pressure drag (i.e., friction). The reduction in pressure drag or friction causes the fluid to drain more rapidly.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0104">Again, it is to be clearly understood that the internal geometric configurations of lumen <b>44</b> of any catheter embodiment <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, <b>30</b>E, <b>30</b>F, <b>30</b>G, <b>30</b>H, or <b>30</b>I can be fabricated with any of the outer geometric configurations of catheter embodiment <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, <b>30</b>E, <b>30</b>F, <b>30</b>G, <b>30</b>H, or <b>30</b>I. So for example, the internally dimpled lumen presented in <figref>FIG. 10C</figref> may be used in combination with any catheter embodiment <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, <b>30</b>E, <b>30</b>F, <b>30</b>G, <b>30</b>H, and <b>30</b>I. Additionally, the internal lumen configuration including a flat wall presented in <figref>FIG. 6A</figref> may be used in combination with any catheter embodiment <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, <b>30</b>E, <b>30</b>F, <b>30</b>G, <b>30</b>H, and <b>30</b>I.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0105">The term âintermittentâ refers to a type of catheter that is not permanent fixture or a repeatably used urine draining device having a balloon seal, such as a Foley-type catheter. Rather, the intermittent catheter <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, <b>30</b>E, <b>30</b>F, <b>30</b>G, <b>30</b>H, and <b>30</b>I is configured to be inserted into urethral, drain urine a single time, then be removed and discarded.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0106">No unnecessary limitations are to be implied therefrom beyond the requirement of the prior art because such terms are used for descriptive purposes and are intended to be broadly construed.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0107">Moreover, the description and illustration of the preferred embodiment of the invention are an example and the invention is not limited to the exact details shown or described.</p>
