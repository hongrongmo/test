      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Traditionally, vaccines have been based on live attenuated or inactivated pathogens. These strategies are inefficient, however, largely because of the antigenic variability of pathogens (e.g., viruses). Several peptide vaccines that comprise antigenic peptides or peptide fragments of pathogens have been developed. Conserved peptide fragments are less likely to exhibit antigenic variability and can overcome some of the problems associated with traditional peptides. Accordingly, subunit vaccines have been developed, which target conserved regions of pathogens. Synthetic peptide vaccines tend to be poorly immunogenic, however. The poor immunogenicity of synthetic peptide vaccines may be attributed to the fact that although these types of vaccines induce humoral antibody responses, they are less likely to induce cell-mediated responses.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Several investigators have sought to improve the antigenicity of synthetic peptide vaccines. For example, Klein et al. describe the engineering of chimeric proteins that comprise an immunogenic region of a protein from a first antigen linked to an immunogenic region from a second pathogen. (See, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,033,668; 6,017,539; 5,998,169; and 5,968,776). Others have sought to create chimeric proteins that couple B-cell epitopes to universal T-cell epitopes in order to improve the immune response. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,114,713). Russell-Jones et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,928,644) also disclose T-cell epitopes derived from the TraT protein of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, which are used to produce hybrid molecules so as to generate an immune response to parasites, soluble factors (e.g., LSH) and viruses. Further, Ruslan (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20030232055) discloses the manufacture of vaccines based on PAMPs and immunogenic antigens.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg) is thought to be a key target for the host immune response in the control of the infection. In particular, the presence of HBcAg-specific T cells has been associated with clearance of acute and chronic infections with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Subsequently, prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines that induce HBcAg-specific T cells have been developed and some have shown efficacy in infectious models. However, despite the high immunogenicity of exogenous HBcAg, many of the studies using endogenous HBcAg as a vaccine have been disappointing.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">When expressed alone, HBcAg will spontaneously assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) that are immunogenic in vivo. These VLPs interact with B cells as the primary antigen-presenting cell (APC) by an unusual interaction with the B cell receptor. HBcAg effectively primes specific T helper (Th) and, much less effectively, cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) as an exogenous antigen when high antigen doses in adjuvant are used. Both DNA- and retrovirus-based immunizations using HBcAg have been reported to induce detectable HBcAg-specific CTLs in mice. Some investigators have sought to use HBcAg VLPs as a platform to display heterogeneous antigens, as well, but these approaches have been hindered by poor assembly and instability of the particles. (See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,818,527; 4,882,145; 5,143,726; 6,231,864; 6,887,464; 6,942,866; 7,144,712; 7,320,795; 7,351,413; and 7,361,352; the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entireties).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">DNA vaccines can be used as a model to study the endogenous immunogenicity of antigens. However, phase I/II clinical trials reveal that it is difficult to prime robust immune responses in humans with direct intramuscular injections of DNA vaccines. Different modes of DNA delivery have now become available, including transdermal delivery of DNA coated to gold beads using the gene gun or treatment of the injection site by in vivo electroporation. The need for approaches that enhance the immune response of a subject after vaccination, in particular DNA vaccination, is manifest.</p>

      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Several embodiments described herein concern isolated nucleic acids, peptides, compositions and methods that are useful for the generation, enhancement, or improvement of an immune response to a target antigen. These compositions are particularly useful to enhance the immune response of a subject that receives a protein or nucleic acid-based immunogen (e.g., DNA immunogen or conventional protein-based vaccine). Although Hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg) is a well known antigen, HBcAg or portions thereof have not been described for use as an adjuvant, which can be administered to a subject in conjunction with a protein or nucleic acid-based immunogen (e.g., a DNA vaccine) so as to improve the immune response to the protein or the protein encoded by the nucleic acid immunogen. In a first series of experiments disclosed herein, it was discovered that a nucleic acid encoding HBcAg improved the immune response of a subject to a co-administered nucleic acid encoding a hepatitis C virus (HCV) protein (NS3/4A).</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In this disclosure, it is revealed that HBcAg, in particular non-human HBcAgs, such as those derived from an avian hepatitis virus, in particular, the virus that infects stork and heron, are uniquely suitable for enhancing an immune response of a subject to a co-administered antigen (e.g., a nucleic acid or peptide immunogen that is administered in a mixture with the HBcAg adjuvant or within approximately at least, equal to, or any number in between 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 30, 45, or 60 minutes before or after inoculation with the immunogen). It is contemplated that HBcAg and fragments thereof or a nucleic acid encoding these compositions are useful additions to immunogen preparations, which improve the immune response of a subject (e.g., a human or mammal) to the immunogen.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Preferably, an HBcAg derived from a hepatitis virus that does not infect a human (a ânon-human HBcAgâ) or a nucleic acid encoding said non-human HBcAg is used as the adjuvant (e.g., an HBcAg derived from an avian hepatitis virus, such as the hepatitis virus that infects stork or heron (e.g., SEQ. ID. NOs. 20 and 22). HBV now afflicts almost a third of the world's population. Accordingly, a significant amount of the population has antibodies that react to an HBcAg derived from a hepatitis virus that infects humans. By utilizing HBcAg sequences derived from divergent hepatitis species, the compositions described herein can be made suitable for introduction into subjects that are already infected with HBV or subjects that have already generated antibodies to HBV (e.g., a subject that had been previously inoculated with an HBV vaccine). Additionally, when nucleic acids encoding an HBcAg or a fragment thereof (e.g., a nucleic acid encoding an HBcAg derived from an avian hepatitis virus that infects stork or heron) are administered, these sequences are, preferably, codon-optimized for expression in the subject (e.g., codon-optimized for expression in the particular animal or human (e.g., SEQ. ID. NOs. 20 and 22)).</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Accordingly, several aspects of the invention described herein concern compositions that comprise, consist essentially of, or that consist of nucleic acids that encode an HBcAg of an avian hepatitis virus (e.g., a hepatitis virus that infects stork or heron (e.g., SEQ. ID. NO. 20 and 22)), which has been codon-optimized for expression in humans and, which can be joined (e.g., in Cis) to a nucleic acid (preferably codon-optimized for expression in an animal or human) that encodes a heterologous antigen (e.g., a non-HBV antigen or a non-hepatitis antigen), such as, SEQ. ID. NOs. 2, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18. In some embodiments, it is preferred that the nucleic acid that encodes a heterologous protein or heterologous protein antigen is inserted in a spike region of the encoded HbcAg (e.g., between amino acid residues of about 87 to about 129). Compositions or mixtures that comprise, consist essentially of, or that consist of nucleic acids (e.g., in Trans) that encode an HBcAg of an avian hepatitis virus (e.g., a hepatitis virus that infects stork or heron), which has been codon-optimized for expression in humans (e.g., SEQ. ID. NO. 20 and 22) and a nucleic acid (preferably codon-optimized for expression in an animal or human) that encodes a heterologous peptide antigen (e.g., a non-HBV peptide or a non-hepatitis peptide), such as SEQ. ID. NOs. 2, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 are also embodiments.

      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">It has been discovered that hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) is a potent adjuvant that improves the immune response of a subject to a co-administered antigen. Disclosed herein are the results of experiments that revealed that a nucleic acid encoding HBcAg improved the immune response of a mammal to a co-administered nucleic acid encoding a hepatitis C virus (HCV) protein (NS3/4A). Accordingly, some embodiments include methods enhancing or improving an immune response of a subject, wherein an HBcAg or a nucleic acid encoding an HBcAg is provided to a subject in a mixture with a peptide immunogen or a nucleic acid encoding a peptide immunogen. In some embodiments, the peptide immunogen or nucleic acid encoding a peptide immunogen is provided in Cis with the HBcAg (e.g., a fusion protein encoding HBcAg joined to a desired peptide antigen or a nucleic acid encoding said fusion protein, see for example SEQ. ID. Nos 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 51, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68 and 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 and 89). In other embodiments, the peptide immunogen or nucleic acid encoding a peptide immunogen is provided in Trans with the HBcAg (e.g., HBcAg or a nucleic acid encoding HBcAg (e.g., SEQ. ID. NO. 10, 20 and 22) is provided in a mixture or co-administered with a desired peptide antigen or a nucleic acid encoding said desired peptide antigen (e.g., SEQ. ID. NOs. 2, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18). Preferably, the compositions described herein comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of an âavian HBcAg,â that is an HBcAg derived from a hepatitis virus that infects a bird, such as stork or heron). It is contemplated that the use of avian HBcAg in the compositions described herein will allow the formulation of immunogenic compositions that are suitable for administration to HBV infected individuals or subjects that have antibodies specific for HBV, since antibodies specific for an HBV that infects humans (âhuman HBVâ) generally do not cross-react with the HBV that infects avian species, such as stork and heron. Additionally, it is preferred that the nucleic acid sequences used in the compositions and methods disclosed herein are codon-optimized for expression in the subject to which the immunogenic compositions are to be administered (e.g., humans).</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Accordingly, one or more of the compositions described herein can be used to improve, enhance or generate an immune response in a subject. By some approaches, a subject in need of an immune response to a particular antigen is identified. The identification step can be accomplished by diagnostic approaches or clinical evaluation (e.g., a subject in need of an immune response to HCV can be identified by diagnostic test or clinical evaluation). Next, one or more of the HBcAg-containing compositions described herein is provided to the identified subject. In some embodiments, the composition comprises an HBcAg protein or fragment thereof that is at least, equal to or any number in between about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, or more amino acids (e.g., HBcAg from a hepatitis that infects birds or humans) and an antigen to which an immune response is desired (e.g., an HCV protein, such as NS3/4A or NS5A). In other embodiments, the composition comprises a nucleic acid that encodes an HBcAg protein or a fragment thereof that is at least, equal to, or any number in between about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 250, 300, or more amino acids (e.g., HBcAg from a hepatitis that infects birds or humans) and a nucleic acid encoding an antigen to which an immune response is desired (e.g., an HCV protein, such as NS3/4A or NS5A). In more embodiments, the composition comprises an HBcAg protein or fragment thereof that is at least, equal to or any number in between about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150 or more amino acids (e.g., HBcAg from a hepatitis that infects birds or humans) and a nucleic acid encoding an antigen to which an immune response is desired (e.g., an HCV protein, such as NS3/4A or NS5A). In still more embodiments, the composition comprises a nucleic acid that encodes an HBcAg protein or a fragment thereof that is at least, equal to, or any number in between about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, or more amino acids (e.g., HBcAg from a hepatitis that infects birds or humans) and an antigen to which an immune response is desired (e.g., an HCV protein, such as NS3/4A or NS5A). Preferably, the compositions described above utilize an HBcAg protein or nucleic acid encoding an HBcAg protein that is derived from an avian hepatitis virus, such as stork or heron (e.g., SEQ. ID. NO. 20 and 22). Preferably, the peptide antigens or nucleic acids encoding said peptide antigens are hepatitis antigens, such as HCV antigens (e.g., NS3/4A or NS5A), HBV antigens (e.g., HBV surface antigen, HBV e antigen, human HBcAg, a human HBV polymerase antigen, a human HBV x antigen) or said peptide antigens or nucleic acids encoding said peptide antigens are birch allergens. Exemplary constructs and nucleic acids encoding preferred antigens, which can be used in one or more of the compositions and methods described herein are provided in SEQ. ID. NOs. 2, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18. Optionally, any of the aforementioned approaches can further include the step of measuring the immune response of the subject before, during, and after administration of the immunogenic composition. Such measurements can be made, for example, by diagnostic evaluation of viral titer in the case of viral disease, clinical evaluation, and scratch tests as are used when evaluating the response to allergens.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">Generally, the generation, enhancement, or improvement of an immune response refers to an induction of a humoral (antibody) response and/or a cellular response. Most simply, an increase in the amount of antigen-specific antibodies (e.g., total IgG) can be seen by utilizing one or more of the embodiments described herein. Enhancement of an immune response also refers to any statistically significant change in the level of one or more immune cells (T cells, B cells, antigen-presenting cells, dendritic cells and the like) or in the activity of one or more of these immune cells (cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity, helper T lymphocyte (HTL) activity, cytokine secretion, change in profile of cytokine secretion). The skilled artisan will readily appreciate that several methods for measuring or establishing whether an immune response is generated, enhanced, or improved are available. A variety of methods for detecting the presence and levels of an immune response are available, for example. (See, e.g., Current Protocols in Immunology, Ed: John E. Coligan, et al. (2001) John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY, NY; Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, (2001), Greene Publ. Assoc. Inc. &amp; John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY, NY; Ausubel et al. (2001) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publ. Assoc. Inc. &amp; John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., NY, N.Y.; Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular Cloning, Second Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Plainview, N.Y.); Maniatis et al. (1982) Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Plainview, N.Y.; and elsewhere). Illustrative methods useful in this context include intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), ELISPOT, proliferation assays, cytotoxic T cell assays including chromium release or equivalent assays, and gene expression analysis using any number of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or RT-PCR based assays. For example, the number of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells specific for a particular antigen or T-cell epitope (TCE) can be measured by flow cytometry. (See, e.g., Frelin et al. (2004) Gene Therapy 11:522-533). CTL priming can also be measured in vivo by, for example, a tumor inhibition model, in which the ability of an animal (e.g., mouse) to inhibit growth of tumors derived from tumor cells engineered to express the antigen of interest.

      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">The nucleocapsid or core antigen HBcAg of HBV is an immunogenic particle composed of 180 subunits of a single protein chain. HBcAg has been disclosed as an immunogenic moiety that stimulates the T cell response of an immunized host animal. See, e.g, U.S. Pat. No. 4,818,527, U.S. Pat. No. 4,882,145 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,726, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. It can be used as a carrier for several peptidic epitopes covalently linked by genetic engineering as well as for chemically coupled protein antigens. (See SÃ¤llberg et al. (1998) Human Gene Therapy 9:1719-29). In addition, HBcAg is non-cytotoxic in humans. Accordingly, it was contemplated that HBcAg is useful in genetic constructs for generating or enhancing an immune response to an accompanied target antigen (e.g., in constructs that encode a TCE derived from a pathogen).</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">Current listings of exemplary HBcAg sequences are publicly available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) world-wide web site. HBcAg nucleic acid sequences (including novel HBcAg regions) can also be isolated from subjects (e.g., humans) infected with HBV. DNA obtained from a patient infected with HBV can be amplified using PCR or another amplification technique.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">For a review of PCR technology, see Molecular Cloning to Genetic Engineering White, B. A. Ed. in <i>Methods in Molecular Biology </i>67: Humana Press, Totowa (1997) and the publication entitled âPCR Methods and Applicationsâ (1991, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press). For amplification of mRNAs, it is within the scope of the invention to reverse transcribe mRNA into cDNA followed by PCR (RT-PCR); or, to use a single enzyme for both steps as described in U.S. Pat.

Accordingly, embodiments described herein may utilize an isolated nucleic acid that encodes an HBcAg derived from a hepatitis virus capable of infecting animals of any species, including but limited to, humans, non-human primates (e.g., baboons, monkeys, and chimpanzees), rodents, mice, reptiles, birds (e.g., stork and heron), pigs, micro-pigs, goats, dogs and cats. In some embodiments, the HBcAg is selected from a human hepatitis antigen or an avian hepatitis antigen. Particularly preferred are the stork hepatitis antigen and a heron hepatitis antigen.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">In certain embodiments, the HBcAg sequences described herein have variations in nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences, compared to native HBcAg sequences and are referred to as HBcAg variants or mutants. As used herein, the term ânativeâ refers to naturally occurring HBV sequences (e.g., available HBV isotypes). Variants may include a substitution, deletion, mutation or insertion of one or more nucleotides, amino acids, or codons encoding the HBcAg sequence, which may result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the HBcAg polypeptide, as compared with the native sequence. Variants or mutants can be engineered, for example, using any of the techniques and guidelines for conservative and non-conservative mutations set forth, for instance, in U.S. Pat.

      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">Accordingly, when the term âconsisting essentially ofâ is used, in some contexts, variants or mutants of an HBcAg sequence or of a particular antigen sequence are intended to be encompassed. That is, in some contexts and in some embodiments, the variants or mutants of the sequences disclosed herein (e.g., SEQ. ID. No. 10) are equivalents because the variation or mutation in sequence does not change or materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of the claimed invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">A codon-optimized HBcAg can, in some embodiments, be encoded within the isolated nucleic acid. A codon-optimized sequence may, in some embodiments, be obtained by substituting codons in an existing sequence with codons more frequently used in the intended host subject (e.g., a human). Some examples include, but are not limited to, codon-optimized nucleic acids encoding human HBcAg (e.g., SEQ. ID. No. 10), codon-optimized nucleic acids encoding stork HBcAg (e.g., SEQ. ID.

      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">Meanwhile, the isolated nucleic acid encoding HBcAg may also be joined to an isolated nucleic acid encoding a heterologous protein. The heterologous protein may generally vary in the same manner discussed above with respect to the HBcAg. Thus, in some embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid sequences may encode native, variants or mutants of a heterologous protein, and these nucleic acids may also be codon-optimized (e.g., a codon-optimized nucleic acid encoding HCV NS3/4A from the human hepatitis virus in SEQ.

In some embodiments, all of the vaccine sequences include a Kozak sequence (e.g., SEQ. ID. No. 106).</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">The heterologous protein, in some embodiments, can be an antigen, such as a plant antigen (e.g., birch antigen), viral antigen, or an animal antigen (e.g., ovalbumin antigen). The antigen may also be a hepatitis antigen, for example a hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigen or a hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigen. The HCV antigens can be from viruses known to infect animals of any species, including, but not limited to, amphibians, reptiles, birdsâsuch as stork, and heron, mice, hamsters, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, woodchucks, pigs, micro-pigs, goats, dogs, cats, humans and non-human primates (e.g., baboons, monkeys, and chimpanzees). Similarly, the HBV antigens can be from viruses known to infect animals of any species, including, but not limited to, amphibians, reptiles, birdsâsuch as stork, and heron, mice, rodents, pigs, micro-pigs, goats, dogs, cats, humans and non-human primates (e.g., baboons, monkeys, and chimpanzees). In certain embodiments, the antigen is a HCV antigen selected from NS3/4A, NS5A, and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the antigen is a HBV antigen selected from a HBV surface antigen, HBV e antigen, human HBcAg, a human HBV polymerase antigen, a human HBV x antigen, and combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">If the isolated nucleotide encodes a heterologous protein that is an HBV antigen, the heterologous protein can be substantially different than the HBcAg also encoded in the isolated nucleotide. As an example, the isolated nucleic acid may include a nucleic acid encoding HBcAg, which is joined to an isolated nucleic acid encoding a heterologous protein, where the heterologous protein is an HBV antigen that is non-naturally occurring or in a non-naturally occurring position with respect to the HBcAg. SEQ. ID. No. 54 is an exemplary nucleic acid that includes this feature because it encodes heron HBcAg joined to human HBcAg. Without being limited to any particular designation, the human HBcAg is an HBV antigen that is in a non-naturally occurring position with respect to the heron HBcAg. Conversely, the heron HBcAg may be designated as the HBV antigen that is in a non-naturally occurring position with respect to the human HBcAg.</p>

In certain embodiments, the NS3 protease cleavage site is between the sequences encoding HBcAg and the heterologous protein. Thus, in some embodiments, the isolated nucleic acids encode a fusion protein, which may be cleaved by NS3 protease. In other aspects, the isolated nucleic acid encodes two or more fragments of HBcAg having a cleavage site between the two encoded fragments.

Thus, for example, the isolated nucleic acid may encode a polypeptide, where the polypeptide comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of avian HBcAg having a fragment of human HBcAg inserted into said avian HBcAg. In some aspects, the human HBcAg fragment is inserted into at least a portion, or all, of the spike region of the avian HBcAg (i.e., the region of HBcAg displayed on the surface the HBcAg capsid).

      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">Disclosed herein are immunogenic compositions relating to genetic constructs that include nucleic acids encoding HBcAg, or a fragment thereof, and nucleic acids encoding a heterologous protein. In some embodiments, both sequences are in the same nucleic acid construct (e.g., the same plasmid). In certain embodiments, both sequences are in separate nucleic acid constructs. Some embodiments of the immunogenic compositions described herein include any of the isolated nucleic acids discussed above, wherein a nucleic acid encoding HBcAg, or a fragment thereof, is joined to a nucleic acid encoding a heterologous protein. Some embodiments of the immunogenic compositions disclosed herein include one or proteins encoded by a nucleic acid described herein.</p>

Accordingly, the nucleic acid contemplated for the immunogenic compositions described herein can be nucleic acids from viruses known to infect animals of any species, including but limited to, humans, mice, reptiles, birds (e.g., stork and heron), rodents, pigs, micro-pigs, goats, dogs, cats, and non-human primates (e.g., baboons, monkeys, and chimpanzees), as mentioned above. In some embodiments, the HBcAg is selected from a human hepatitis antigen, an avian hepatitis antigen, a stork hepatitis antigen, and a heron hepatitis antigen.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">The sequences encoding HBcAg can generally be the same as those discussed above with respect to the isolated nucleic acids. Thus, in some embodiments, any of the nucleic acid sequences described above that include HBcAg may be used in the immunogenic composition. As an example, the isolated nucleic acid may include native (e.g., SEQ. ID. No. 71) or variant HBcAg or mutant HBcAg, and the nucleic acid may also be codon-optimized (e.g., SEQ. ID. No. 22). In some embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid encodes a fragment of HBcAg, as described above with respect to the isolated nucleic acids. For example, fragment of the HBcAg sequence can comprise at least, equal to, greater than, or less than, or any number in between 3, 5, 10, 20, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, or 175 consecutive amino acids of a natural or synthetic HBcAg polypeptide.

In some embodiments, said homologous nucleic acids generate, enhance, or improve an immune response, as defined above. Several techniques exist to determine nucleic acid or protein sequence homology. Thus, embodiments of the nucleic acids can have from 70% homology or sequence identity to 100% homology or sequence identity to any one of the nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences disclosed herein.

Using a computer program such as BLAST or FASTA, two sequences can be aligned for optimal matching of their respective base pairs (either along the full length of one or both sequences, or along a predetermined portion of one or both sequences). Such programs provide âdefaultâ opening penalty and a âdefaultâ gap penalty, and a scoring matrix such as PAM 250 (a standard scoring matrix; see Dayhoff et al., in: Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, Vol. 5, Supp. 3 (1978)) can be used in conjunction with the computer program.</p>

The heterologous protein encoded by the nucleic acid, in some embodiments, can be an antigen, such as a plant antigen (e.g., birch antigen), viral antigen, or an animal antigen (e.g., ovalbumin antigen). The antigen may also be a hepatitis antigen, for example a hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigen or a hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigen. The HCV antigens can be from viruses known to infect animals of any species, including, but not limited to, amphibians, reptiles, birds (e.g., stork and heron) mice, hamsters, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, woodchucks, pigs, micro-pigs, goats, dogs, cats, humans and non-human primates (e.g., baboons, monkeys, and chimpanzees).

It is to be understood that the following examples are not comprehensive or exhaustive of the many types of embodiments which can be prepared in accordance with the present invention.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Example 1</heading>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0144">The NS3/4A sequence was amplified from the serum of an HCV-infected patient (HCV genotype 1a) using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Total RNA was extracted from serum, and cDNA synthesis and PCR were performed according to standard protocols (Chen M et al., <i>J. Med. Virol. </i>43:223-226 (1995)). The cDNA synthesis was initiated using the antisense primer âNS4KRâ (5â²-CCG TCT AGA TCA GCA CTC TTC CAT TTC ATC-3â² (SEQ. ID. NO. 98)). From this cDNA, a 2079 base pair DNA fragment of HCV, corresponding to amino acids 1007 to 1711, which encompasses the NS3 and NS4A genes, was amplified. A high fidelity polymerase (Expand High Fidelity PCR, Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) was used with the âNS3KFâ primer (5â²-CCT GAA TTC ATG GCG CCT ATC ACG GCC TAT-3â² (SEQ. ID. NO. 99) and the NS4KR primer. The NS3KF primer contained a EcoRI restriction enzyme cleavage site and a start codon and the primer NS4KR contained a XbaI restriction enzyme cleavage site and a stop codon.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0145">The amplified fragment was then sequenced (SEQ. ID. NO. 100). Sequence comparison analysis revealed that the gene fragment was amplified from a viral strain of genotype 1a. A computerized BLAST search against the Genbank database using the NCBI website revealed that the closest HCV homologue was 93% identical in nucleotide sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0146">The amplified DNA fragment was then digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and was inserted into a pcDNA3.1/His plasmid (Invitrogen) digested with the same enzymes. The NS3/4A-pcDNA3.1 plasmid was then digested with EcoRI and Xba I and the insert was purified using the QiaQuick kit (Qiagen, Hamburg, Germany) and was ligated to a EcoRI/Xba I digested pVAX vector (Invitrogen) so as to generate the NS3/4A-pVAX plasmid.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0147">The NS3 truncated mutant was obtained by deleting NS4A sequence from the NS3/4A DNA. Accordingly, the NS3 gene sequence of NS3/4A-pVAX was PCR amplified using the primers NS3KF and 3â²NotI (5â²-CCA CGC GGC CGC GAC GAC CTA CAG-3â² (SEQ. ID. NO.: 101)) containing EcoRI and Not I restriction sites, respectively. The NS3 fragment (1850 bp) was then ligated to a EcoRI and Not I digested pVAX plasmid to generate the NS3-pVAX vector. Plasmids were grown in BL21 <i>E. coli </i>cells. The plasmids were sequenced and were verified by restriction cleavage and the results were as to be expected based on the original sequence.</p>

      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0149">Plasmids are grown in BL21 <i>E. coli </i>cells, and sequenced for accuracy. Plasmid DNA used for in vivo vaccination is purified using Qiagen DNA purification columns, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, FRG).</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0150">Groups of eight to ten C57/BL6 mice are primed with HBcAg-pVAX1 intra muscularly (i.m.). For i.m. delivery, mice are immunized by needle injections of 100 Î¼g plasmid DNA given intramuscularly to the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. 5 days prior to DNA immunization, mice are injected intramuscularly with 50 Î¼l per TA muscle of 0.01 mM cardiotoxin (Latoxan) in 0.9% sterile saline. The mice are boosted with a second injection of 100 Î¼g plasmid DNA four weeks subsequent to the first DNA immunization. Each injection dose contains 100 Î¼g of plasmid DNA. Immunizations are performed at weeks 0 and 4.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0151">The presence of CTLs specific for SEQ ID NO:10 is assayed using a standard <sup>51</sup>Cr-release assay. Briefly, spleen cells are harvested from mice 14 days after the initial immunization or the booster immunization. Chromium release assays are performed as described in Lazdina, et al. (2003) <i>J. Gen. Virol. </i>84:1-8, herein expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety. Single cell suspensions are prepared. 25Ã10<sup>6 </sup>splenocytes are restimulated with 25Ã10<sup>6 </sup>syngenic irradiated (20 Gy) splenocytes pulsed with 0.05 Î¼M peptide, as previously described. Sandberg et al. (2000) <i>J. Immunol. </i>165:25-33, herein expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety. Restimulation cultures are set in 12 ml complete RPMI medium (Gibco). After 5 days, effector cells are harvested and washed twice. RMA-S target cells (Karre et al. (1986) <i>Nature </i>319:675-678) are pulsed with 50 Î¼M peptide for 90 min at 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and 37Â° C. Serial dilutions of effector cells are incubated with 5Ã10<sup>3 51</sup>chromium-labeled peptide pulsed RMA-S target cells in a final volume of 200 Î¼l per well in 96-well plates. After a 4 hour incubation at 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and 37Â° C., 100 Î¼l of supernatant is collected and the radioactivity is determined using a Î³ counter. The percentage of specific release is calculated according to the formula: (Experimental releaseâspontaneous release/total releaseâspontaneous release)Ã100.</p>

      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0152">The expression of the HBcAg and NS3/4a proteins from plasmids were analyzed by an in vitro transcription and translation assay. Each sequence was cloned into pVAX1 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.).</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0153">The following constructs were studied: (1) codon-optimized NS3/4A (SEQ. ID. No. 2); (2) codon-optimized HBcAg; (3) NS3/4A-HBcAg (SEQ. ID.

        <i>a</i>-<i>b </i>show the results of gel electrophoresis using 10% Tris-HCl SDS gel after 24 hours of exposure. The results confirm that constructs encoding cleavage sites were cleaved to form multiple, distinct proteins. For example, Construct 4 exhibits 2 sharp bands associated with two portions of the encoded polypeptide that are separated by a cleavage site. In contrast, nucleic acids lacking cleavage sites, such as Construct 2, exhibit only a single sharp band.</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">Example 4</heading>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0155">Constructs 1 and 4, as discussed in Example 3, were tested in mouse models to assay the ability to induce and immune response. Plasmids were grown in BL21 <i>E. coli </i>cells, and sequenced for accuracy. Plasmid DNA used for in vivo vaccination was purified using Qiagen DNA purification columns, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, FRG). The concentration of the resulting plasmid DNA was determined spectrophotometrically (Dynaquant, Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and the purified DNA was dissolved in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0156">Two types of mice were tested, HLA-A2 transgenic mice (HHD) and HCV NS3/4A+HLA-A2 transgenic mice (H3). The HCV NS3/4A+HLA-A2 transgenic mouse model is a preferred animal model for therapeutic vaccination because it provides a partly human immune system that is dysfunctional due to a persistent presence of a viral antigen. Accordingly, this model is representative of chronic HCV infection in humans.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0157">Mice were intra muscularly (i.m.) immunized with 50 Î¼g of Construct 1 or 4 at 0 and 4 weeks. Meanwhile, four other mice groups were co-administered 50 Î¼g of IL-12 or IL-21 along with Construct 1 or 4 at 0 and 4 weeks. Mice were sacrificed at week 6 and spleens harvested and analyzed for HCV-specific IFNÎ³ production by ELISpot as described in Ahlen G, Soderholm J, Tjelle T E, et al. âIn vivo Electroporation Enhances the Immunogenicity of Hepatitis C Virus Nonstructural 3/4A DNA by Increased Local DNA Uptake, Protein Expression, Inflammation, and Infiltration of CD3+ cells,â J.

More specifically, <figref>FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>shows the immune response from the administration of codon-optimized NS3/4A (Construct 1), codon-optimized NS3/4A coadministered with IL-12, and mutant NS3/4A-HBcAg (Construct 4), respectively, when administered to HHD mice. The adjuvant activity of HBcAg is demonstrated by the increased immune response of mice receiving Construct 4 relative to both Construct 1 and Construct 1 co-administered with IL-12. <figref>FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>show the immune response from the administration of codon-optimized NS3/4A (Construct 1), codon-optimized NS3/4A coadministered with IL-12, and mutant NS3/4A-HBcAg (Construct 4), respectively, when administered to H3 mice. These results further demonstrate the adjuvant activity of HBcAg.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0159">To further improve the immune response, mutant NS3/4A-HBcAg was co-administered with either IL-12 or IL-21 to HHD and H3 mice. <figref>FIGS. 3</figref><i>d</i>-<i>e </i>show results in the HHD mouse model, and demonstrate the immune response is further increased by the addition of IL-12 or IL-21, relative to mutant NS3/4A-HBcAg administered alone (i.e., as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref><i>c</i>). The results show IL-12 produced generally a greater immune response compared to IL-21. Finally, <figref>FIGS. 4</figref><i>d</i>-<i>e </i>show the results in the H3 mouse model. Again, both IL-12 and IL-21 improved the immune response of mutant NS3/4A-HBcAg relative the administration of mutant NS3/4A-HBcAg alone (i.e., as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>). Most interestingly, IL-21 produced a generally greater immune response in H3 mouse compared to IL-12.</p>

      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0160">To further evaluate the adjuvant activity of HBcAg, both HHD and H3 transgenic mice are intramuscularly administered compositions having constructs encoding HBcAg and isolated constructs encoding an antigen. To prepare each construct, each sequence is independently cloned into a separate pVAX1 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The plasmids are prepared generally using the same techniques as disclosed in Example 2.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0161">Compositions are prepared by admixing a vector encoding codon-optimized HBcAg and a vector encoding an antigen in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. 50 Î¼g of this mixture is administered intramuscularly to HHD and H3 mice using the same techniques and analyzed using ELISpot as described in Example 3.
