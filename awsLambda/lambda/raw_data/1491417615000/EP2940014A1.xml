        <u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u>
      </b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of the TEC family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, which consists of 650 amino acid residues and contains pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, zinc-finger region, SH3 domain, SH2 domain, and kinase domain. Recently, kinase domain, among said domains, is gaining more interests as a drug target.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">BTK is found in B-cells and hematopoietic cells, rather than some T-cells, natural killer cells, plasma cells, etc. When BTK is stimulated by the B-cell membrane receptor (BCR) signals that are caused by various inflammatory responses or cancers, BTK plays an important role in production of cytokines such as TNF-Î±, IL-6, etc., as well as NF-ÎºB by initiating downstream signaling such as phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCy2).</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In the treatment of inflammation, BTK is known for mediating responses of the membrane receptors, <i>e.g.,</i> B-cell antigen receptors which detect inflammation-inducing substances, CD40, TLR-4, Fcg and the like. Also, BTK has a strong influence on the signaling mechanism of inflammation caused by stimulation of mast cell, B-cell and macrophage. Therefore, inhibition of BTK may block IgE signaling which may slow down the progression of diseases caused by abnormal activation of BTK. This signaling mechanism is a complicated signaling pathway of immunosubstance secretion. In this process, protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation take place in a multi-step procedure, and since BTK is one of the high-level steps in the signaling pathway, along with spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and, thus, it is more effective for preventing activation of factors that cause immune responses than other kinase targets.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Further, in the treatment of cancer, it is known that BTK modifies BCR and B-cell surface proteins which generate antisuicide signals. Thus, inhibition of BTK may bring about anticancer effects against cancers that are associated with BCR signaling such as lymphoma. In fact, Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) developed by Pharmacyclics Inc. was recently approved as an anti-cancer agent for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and a phase III trial of AVL-292 developed by Avila Therapeutics for small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL) and CLL is currently underway. It has been proven that these compounds are quite effective against SLL and CLL that are relatively rare type of cancers. However, they have failed to achieve satisfactory results against diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) which is more prevalent type of lymphoma. Thus, there is a growing demand for a noble drug.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The action mechanism of BTK inhibitor as an anti-inflammatory agent as well as an anti-cancer agent is thoroughly described in the reference [<nplcit id="ncit-00001" npl-type="s"><text>Nature Chemical Biology 7, (2011), 4</text></nplcit>].</p>

    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be determined by conducting an ordinary test in order to find out the most effective administration route and suitable preparation method. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be prepared into any type of formulation and drug delivery system by using any of the conventional methods well-known in the art. The inventive pharmaceutical composition may be formulated into injectable formulations, which may be administereby by routes including intrathecal, intraventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, intraocular, intramuscular, subcutaneous or intraosseous. Also, it may also be administered orally, or parenterally through the rectum, the intestines or the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity (<i>see</i><nplcit id="ncit-00002" npl-type="b"><text>Gennaro, A. R., ed. (1995) Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences</text></nplcit>). Preferably, the composition is administered topically, instead of enterally. For instance, the composition may be injected, or delivered via a targeted drug delivery system such as a reservoir formulation or a sustained release formulation.</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention may be prepared by any well-known methods in the art, such as mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilizing processes.

    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. For injection, for example, the composition may be formulated in an aqueous solution, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal or nasal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the inventive compound may be prepared in an oral formulation. For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated readily by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers known in the art. Such carriers enable the inventive compounds to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a subject. The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.</p>

Suitable excipients may be, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose formulation such as maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) formulation. Also, disintegrating agents may be employed, such as cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. Also, wetting agents, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate and the like, may be added.</p>
    <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compounds doses.</p>
    <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Pharmaceutical formulations for oral administration may include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration.</p>
    <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention may be administered transdermally, such as through a skin patch, or topically. In one aspect, the transdermal or topical formulations of the present invention can additionally comprise one or multiple penetration enhancers or other effectors, including agents that enhance migration of the delivered compound. Preferably, transdermal or topical administration may be used, <i>e.g.,</i> in situations in which location specific delivery is desired.</p>
    <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">For administration by inhalation, the compounds of the present invention may be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, <i>e.g.,</i> dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or any other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the appropriate dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, <i>e.g.,</i> gelatin, for use in an inhaler or insufflators may be formulated. These typically contain a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. Compositions formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion, can be presented in unit dosage form <i>e.g.,</i> in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions or other compositions in water-soluble form.</p>
    <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Suspensions of the active compounds may also be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles may include fatty oils such as sesame oil and synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, <i>e.g.,</i> sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.</p>
    <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As mentioned above, the compositions of the present invention may also be formulated as a reservoir formulation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (<i>e.g.,</i> subcutaneous or intramuscular) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the inventive compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (<i>e.g.,</i> an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, <i>e.g.,</i> a sparingly soluble salt.</p>
    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">For any composition used in the present methods of treatment, a therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially using a variety of techniques well-known in the art. For example, based on information obtained from a cell culture assay, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating concentration range that includes the IC<sub>50</sub>. Similarly, dosage ranges appropriate for human subjects can be determined, for example, using data obtained from cell culture assays and other animal studies.</p>
    <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">A therapeutically effective dose of an agent refers to the amount of the agent that results in amelioration of symptoms or a prolongation of survival in a subject. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such molecules can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, for example, by determining the LD<sub>50</sub> (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED<sub>50</sub> (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, which can be expressed as the ratio LD<sub>50</sub>/ED<sub>50</sub>. Agents that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred.</p>
    <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Dosages preferably fall within a range of circulating concentrations that includes the ED<sub>50</sub> with little or no toxicity. Dosages may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration, and dosage should be chosen, according to methods well-known in the art, in view of the specifics of a subject's condition.</p>
    <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In addition, the amount of agent or composition administered will be dependent on a variety of factors, including the age, weight, sex, health condition, degree of disease of the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, and the judgment of the prescribing physician.</p>
    <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Hereinafter, an exemplary method for preparing the compound of the present invention is explained.</p>
    <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Various starting materials may be prepared in accordance with conventional synthetic methods well-known in the art.
