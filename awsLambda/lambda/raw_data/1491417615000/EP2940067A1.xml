    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Since ethylene/tetrafluoroethylene copolymers (ETFE) are excellent in heat resistance and weather resistance and lighter than glass, the use of an ETFE film on the surface of a solar battery, in replacement of glass, is now considered.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">An ETFE film, however, problematically has insufficient transparency in comparison with glass. Moreover, if an ETFE film fails to be cooled in such a manner that the temperature distribution of the film becomes uniform upon production thereof by melt molding, the cooled film problematically has poor transparency and has loosening or wrinkles.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Patent Literature 1 discloses a method for producing a fluororesin film wherein, upon production of a flat film by contacting a molten fluoriresin extruded from a T-die with a cooling roll and then rolling the cooled and solidified resin up, the cooling roll is set to have a surface temperature of 80Â°C to 140Â°C and hot air at 50Â°C to 160Â°C is blown to the film on the cooling roll, for the purpose of producing a fluororesin film excellent in flatness and optical properties such as transparency and gloss.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Patent Literature 2 discloses, as a tetrafluoroethylene-ethylene copolymer having a high light transmittance and low haze, a tetrafluoroethylene-ethylene copolymer wherein the copolymer having a ratio of (polymerization unit derived from tetrafluoroethylene)/(polymerization unit derived from ethylene) of 30/70 to 70/30 (molar ratio) further contains 1 to 10 (mol%) of a polymerization unit derived from vinyl ether represented by CF<sub>2</sub>=CF-O-R (1) (in the formula, R represents C3-C12 alkyl group optionally containing 1 to 3 ether oxygen atoms), is crystalline, and has a volume flow rate of 1 to 1000 mm<sup>3</sup>/sec.</p>

    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024"> The film of the present invention has a crystallinity of 68% or less, the crystallinity being calculated by the following equation on the basis of a diffraction intensity curve of the film resulting from X-ray diffraction measurement: <maths id="maths-00003-en" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Crystallinity</mi><mspace width="1em" /><mfenced><mo>%</mo></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mfenced separators=""><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi></mrow><mrow><mn mathvariant="normal">19</mn></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi></mrow><mrow><mn mathvariant="normal">20</mn></mrow></msub></mfenced><mo>/</mo><mfenced separators=""><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi></mrow><mrow><mn mathvariant="normal">17</mn></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi></mrow><mrow><mn mathvariant="normal">19</mn></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi></mrow><mrow><mn mathvariant="normal">20</mn></mrow></msub></mfenced><mo>Ã</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">100</mn></mrow></math><img id="img-00003-en" wi="132" he="5" img-content="math" file="imgb0003.tif" img-format="tif" /></maths> wherein S<sub>20</sub> represents a peak area around 2Î¸ = 20Â°,<br /> S<sub>17</sub> represents a peak area around 2Î¸ = 17Â°, and<br /> S<sub>19</sub> represents a peak area around 2Î¸ = 19Â°.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The X-ray diffraction measurement is performed using a powder X-ray diffraction device on a sample that is cut out from a film, attached on a quartz plate, and immobilized on a sample table. The resulting diffraction intensity curve is subjected to peak analysis by the peak separation method using analysis software. On the basis of the diffraction intensity curve obtained by the peak separation method, the crystallinity is calculated using the above equation.<br /> Measurement method: 2Î¸/Î¸ method<br /> X-ray intensity: 40 kv, 120 mA<br /> X-ray source: CuKÎ± ray<br /> Analysis software: JADE 6.0 available from Rigaku Corporation<br /> Measurement temperature: Room temperature</p>

    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">It is presumed that the peak observed around 2Î¸ = 20Â° is a peak derived from the (200) plane, the peak observed around 2Î¸ = 19Â° is a peak derived from the (120) plane, and the peak observed around S<sub>17</sub>: 2Î¸ = 17Â° is a peak due to diffraction from an amorphous region of the sample.</p>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The peak around 2Î¸ = 20Â° is often observed at 2Î¸ = 20Â° Â± 0.4, and the peak around 2Î¸ = 19Â° is often observed at 2Î¸ = 19Â° Â± 0.4.</p>
    <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Low crystallinity of the film can be achieved by devising the composition and a special molding method of copolymers included in the film. A description is later given on the composition and the molding method of copolymers.</p>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The film of the present invention preferably has a peak area ratio around 2Î¸ = 20Â° calculated by the following equation of 10.0% or less: <maths id="maths-00004-en" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Peak area ratio</mi><mspace width="1em" /><mfenced><mo>%</mo></mfenced><mo>=</mo><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi></mrow><mrow><mn mathvariant="normal">20</mn></mrow></msub><mo>/</mo><mfenced separators=""><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi></mrow><mrow><mn mathvariant="normal">19</mn></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi></mrow><mrow><mn mathvariant="normal">20</mn></mrow></msub></mfenced><mo>Ã</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">100.</mn></mrow></math><img id="img-00004-en" wi="107" he="5" img-content="math" file="imgb0004.tif" img-format="tif" /></maths></p>

    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Rf in Formula (1) represents a fluoroalkyl group having 2 or more carbon atoms. Since the film of the present invention includes a copolymer containing a monomer unit that has a fluoroalkyl group having 2 or more carbon atoms, the film has high transparency and excellent heat resistance. The fluoroalkyl group may be linear or branched. Rf preferably represents a fluoroalkyl group having 2 to 10 carbon atoms, and more preferably represents a fluoroalkyl group having 2 to 6 carbon atoms.</p>

    <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The copolymer contains 0.8 to 2.5 mol% of the (fluoroalkyl)ethylene unit represented by the formula (1) relative to the amount of all the monomer units. Including the copolymer containing the (fluoroalkyl)ethylene unit represented by the formula (1) in an amount within the range mentioned above, the film of the present invention has high transparency and excellent heat resistance.

    <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In the copolymer, the molar ratio of the ethylene unit to the tetrafluoroethylene unit is 30.0/70.0 to 50.0/50.0. Including the copolymer having a molar ratio of the ethylene unit to the tetrafluoroethylene unit within the range mentioned above, the film of the present invention has high transparency and excellent heat resistance.

    <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Here, the amount of each monomer unit is a value obtained by <sup>19</sup>F-NMR analysis.</p>
    <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The copolymer may contain a fourth monomer unit different from the ethylene unit, the tetrafluoroethylene unit, and the (fluoroalkyl)ethylene unit. Examples of the fourth monomer include vinylidene fluoride, chlorotrifluoroethylene, vinyl fluoride, hexafluoropropylene, hexafluoroisobutene, and perfluoro (alkyl vinyl ether) represented by CF<sub>2</sub>=CF-ORf<sup>1</sup> (in the formula, Rf<sup>1</sup> represents a C1-C8 perfluoroalkyl group), and alkyl perfluoro vinyl ether derivatives represented by CF<sub>2</sub>=CF-OCH<sub>2</sub>-Rf<sup>2</sup> (in the formula, Rf<sup>2</sup> represents a C1-C5 perfluoroalkyl group). In terms of the heat resistance, transparency, and cost, the copolymer contains a fourth monomer in an amount of preferably 0 to 2 mol% and more preferably 0 to 0.5 mol%. Still more preferably, the copolymer contains substantially no fourth monomer.</p>
    <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The copolymer has a glass transition temperature of preferably 50Â°C to 120Â°C and more preferably 60Â°C to 110Â°C because such a copolymer has excellent heat resistance and moldability. The glass transition temperature can be determined, for example, as follows. The temperature dependence of tanÎ´ is measured from -50Â°C to 150Â°C under the conditions of the frequency of 1 Hz and the rate of temperature rise of 5Â°C/min using dynamic discoelasticity measuring device (Advanced Rheometric Expansion System, ARES, available from Rheometric Scientific, Inc.) in a torsional mode (using Torsion Rectangular Kit). The peak temperature of the resulting tanÎ´ curve corresponds to the glass transition temperature.</p>
    <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The copolymer has a melting point of preferably 170Â°C to 280Â°C and more preferably 190Â°C to 270Â°C because such a copolymer has excellent heat resistance and moldability. The melting point can be determined as a temperature corresponding to a local maximum value on a heat of fusion curve that is obtained by increasing the temperature of the copolymer at a rate of temperature rise of 10Â°C/min using a DSC device (product of Seiko Instruments Inc.).</p>
    <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The copolymer has a crystallization temperature of preferably 160Â°C to 270Â°C and more preferably 180Â°C to 260Â°C because such a copolymer has excellent heat resistance and transparency.</p>
    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The crystallization temperature can be determined as a temperature corresponding to a local minimum value on a heat of fusion curve that is obtained by lowering the temperature of the copolymer at a rate of temperature decrease of 10Â°C/min using a DSC device (product of Seiko Instruments Inc.).</p>
    <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The copolymer preferably has a melt flow rate [MFR] of 0.5 to 100 g/10 min, and more preferably 40 (g/10 min) or less and 4.0 g/10 min or more. The MFR can be determined by measuring the weight (g) of the polymer flowing out from a nozzle having a diameter of 2 mm and a length of 8 mm in a unit time (10 minutes) at 297Â°C under a load of 5 kg using a melt indexer (product of TOYO SEIKI SEISAKUSHO, LTD.).</p>
    <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The copolymer can be produced by a known polymerization method such as suspension polymerization, emulsion polymerization, bulk polymerization, or solution polymerization.</p>
    <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The film of the present invention preferably has a transmittance of light having a wavelength of 300 to 1100 nm of 75% or more. In measurement of the light transmittance, a film for measurement having a thickness of 50 Âµm is prepared and a spectrophotometer U-4000 (product of Hitachi, Ltd.) is used. The light transmittance as used herein refers to a minimum value of the light transmittance values at individual wavelengths in a measuring range of 300 to 1100 nm.</p>
    <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The film of the present invention has a haze value of 2.5 or less. In the measurement of the haze value, a film for measurement having a thickness of 50 Âµm is prepared and a HAZE-GARD II available from TOYO SEIKI SEISAKUSHO, LTD. is used. The lower limit of the haze value is not particularly limited, and may be set to 0.1.</p>
    <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The film of the present invention has an arithmetic average inclination of preferably 0.2Â° or less. The arithmetic average inclination can be determined as follows. A film for measurement having a thickness of 50 Âµm is prepared, and the surface roughness thereof is measured using a surface roughness meter (SURFTEST SV-600, product of Mitsutoyo Corporation). After extraction of the waviness excluding the roughness equal to or less than the arithmetic average roughness, the arithmetic average inclination can be calculated. The lower limit of the arithmetic average inclination is not particularly limited, and may be set to 0.01Â°.</p>
    <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The film of the present invention after being heated to the softening point or higher and then cooled preferably still has an arithmetic average inclination of 0.2Â° or less. If the film produced by biaxial stretching is heated to the softening point or higher under the condition that the film is not externally stretched, the molecules immobilized by stretching resume to the original state before the stretching. In such a case, the film is rapidly shrunk to have wrinkles. The reason for this is that the copolymer is a non-polar polymer. Since the film of the present invention is produced by the production method described later, the film has a non-oriented crystalline state and is not to be shrunk even when heated to the softening point or higher. If the film is cooled by hot wind or the like at a temperature not exceeding the crystallization temperature of the copolymer, the surface temperature of the film becomes equal to or lower than the crystallization temperature of the copolymer, adversely affecting the transparency of the film.</p>
    <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The film of the present invention has a thickness of preferably 10 to 100 Âµm and more preferably 15 to 50 Âµm. If the film is too thick, the transparency may be poor, whereas if the film is too thin, the mechanical strength may be poor.</p>
    <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The film of the present invention may contain ingredients such as an antioxidant and a UV absorber.</p>
    <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Next, a description is given on the production method of the film of the present invention.</p>
    <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The film of the present invention can be favorably produced by a method including the steps of<br /> melting a copolymer by heating to a melting point or higher,<br /> molding the molten copolymer into a film,<br /> rapidly cooling the film by contacting the film maintained to have a temperature not lower than the crystallization temperature of the copolymer, with a cooling roll set to have a temperature not exceeding a temperature that is higher than the glass transition temperature of the film by 10Â°C, and<br /> collecting the rapidly cooled film.</p>
    <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The melting step and the molding step may be carried out by known methods. For example, an extruder equipped with a die may be used. The heating temperature is higher than the melting point of the copolymer preferably by 60Â°C or higher and more preferably by 80Â°C or higher.</p>
    <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The film resulting from the molding step is kept at a temperature higher than the crystallization temperature of the copolymer by 20Â°C or more while the film is moved to the cooling step with no resting time between the steps.</p>
    <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The surface temperature of the film immediately before the contact with the cooling roll is higher than the crystallization temperature by preferably 20Â°C, more preferably by 40Â°C or higher, and still more preferably by 70Â°C or higher.</p>
    <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">For the purpose of keeping the temperature of the film resulting from the molding step high, the distance (air gap) from the outlet of the die to the contact point where the film and the cooling roll becomes in contact with each other is preferably short. Specifically, the air gap is preferably 50 mm or shorter, and if the air gap is 15 mm or shorter, the result is especially favorable.</p>
    <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058"> In the cooling step, the high-temperature film resulting from the molding step is rapidly cooled. The surface temperature of the cooling roll used for rapid cooling is preferably set to a temperature not exceeding a temperature that is higher than the glass transition temperature of the film by 10Â°C, and is more preferably set to a temperature not exceeding the glass transition temperature of the film. If the temperature of the cooling roll exceeds the temperature that is higher than the glass transition temperature by 10Â°C, the crystallinity of the film becomes higher, adversely affecting the transparency. The surface temperature of the cooling roll is preferably 20Â°C or higher because the film is less likely to have wrinkles in such a case.</p>
    <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">In order to achieve high transparency, the surface temperature of the film and the surface temperature of the cooling roll immediately before the contact of the film with the cooling roll are significantly important. The difference between the surface temperature of the film and the surface temperature of the cooling roll immediately before the contact of the film with the cooling roll is preferably 200Â°C or higher and more preferably 220Â°C or higher, and preferably 340Â°C or lower and more preferably 320Â°C or lower. If the temperature difference is too small, the resulting film may not be sufficiently transparent, whereas if the temperature difference is too large, the film is likely to have wrinkles. When the wrinkles are formed, the film may not be sufficiently transparent.</p>
    <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">If the film has a part not sufficiently contacting the cooling roll upon contact of the film with the cooling roll, the part cannot be cooled at an enough cooling speed and may possibly be opaque. Moreover, variation in the cooling speed may cause formation of wrinkles in the film. Accordingly, the cooling roll is preferably equipped with a means for increasing the degree of contact between the film and the roll. Exemplary methods include a method of pressing the film to the cooling roll by a pressing roll provided to face the cooling roll through the film, a method of charging the cooling roll with static electricity for firm contact of the film with the cooling roll, and a method of drawing air between the cooling roll and the film for firm contact of the film with the cooling roll. In a method of blowing hot air to the film for firm contact of the film with the cooling roll, the film is not in contact with the roll sufficiently during the cooling, so that a sufficiently transparent film cannot be obtained.</p>
    <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">From the standpoint of avoiding formation of wrinkles in the film, the method of firmly contacting the film with the cooling roll is preferably the method of charging the cooling roll with static electricity for firm contact of the film with the cooling roll or the method of pressing the film by the pressing roll for firm contact of the film with the cooling roll. In terms of the uniformity of the degree of contact of the film with the cooling roll, more preferred is the method of charging the cooling roll with static electricity.</p>
    <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">The transparent film without wrinkles resulting from the cooling step is wound by a roll, for example, in the collecting step.</p>
    <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">
      <figref>Fig. 1</figref> shows one example of the production method of the film. As illustrated in <figref>Fig. 1</figref>, a molten copolymer is extruded in a shape of a film from die 11 provided in an extruder (not illustrated), and extruded film 13 comes in contact with cooling roll 12, thereby being cooled. The cooled film 13 is passed to a collecting roll (not illustrated) and wound by a take-up roll (not illustrated). As illustrated in <figref>Fig. 2</figref>, film 13 may be made in contact with cooling roll 12 firmly by pressing roll 21. In such a method, since the degree of contact between film 13 and cooling roll 12 increases, the resulting film has high transparency and has no wrinkles. As illustrated in <figref>Fig. 3</figref>, film 13 may be made in contact with cooling roll 12 firmly by electrostatic pinning 31. The electrostatic pinning is provided with electrodes (not illustrated), and application of an voltage to the electrodes generates static electricity, thereby firmly contacting film 13 with cooling roll 12. Two electrodes may be provided in such a manner as to present at both ends of the film.</p>
    <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Since being transparent and having high heat resistance, the film of the present invention can be suitably used for a solar battery. The present invention also encompasses a solar battery including the film of the present invention. The solar battery of the present invention preferably has the film of the present invention on a plane where the sunlight is incident. Since the film of the present invention also has weather resistance, the film is more preferably provided on an outermost surface of the plane where the sunlight is incident.</p>
    <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The solar battery of the present invention preferably includes a solar battery cell, a sealing material layer with the solar battery cell sealed inside, and the film of the present invention provided on either or both faces of the sealing material layer. The solar battery of the present invention may include another layer between the film of the present invention and the sealing material layer.</p>
    <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">The film of the present invention having excellent transparency and heat resistance and cost efficiency is suitably used in a wide range of fields, such as film materials for lamination, film materials for adhesion tapes, agricultural coating materials for tunnel houses and pipe houses, electric insulating films, heavy duty packaging films, and films for solar batteries, especially, laminated films with an EVA layer for solar batteries.</p>

Then, the film was made in contact with a cooling roll set at 80Â°C and gave a film having a thickness of 40 to 60 Âµm under the film-forming conditions of a collecting rate of 5 m/min and an air gap of 15 mm. Upon contact of the film with a cooling roll, both ends of the film was pressed to the roll by an electrostatic pinning to which a 10 kV voltage was applied, so as to be prevented from shrinking. In this manner, the roll and the film was made in contact with each other firmly so that no air entered therebetween, thereby avoiding formation of wrinkles due to the cooling roll.</p>
