      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of therapeutics for hemostatic disorders.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Hemophilia B (also known as Christmas disease) is one of the most common inherited bleeding disorders in the world. It results in decreased in vivo and in vitro blood clotting activity and requires extensive medical monitoring throughout the life of the affected individual. In the absence of intervention, the afflicted individual will suffer from spontaneous bleeding in the joints, which produces severe pain and debilitating immobility; bleeding into muscles results in the accumulation of blood in those tissues; spontaneous bleeding in the throat and neck may cause asphyxiation if not immediately treated; renal bleeding; and severe bleeding following surgery, minor accidental injuries, or dental extractions also are prevalent.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Normal in vivo blood coagulation at minimum requires the serine proteases Factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, X and XI (soluble plasma proteins); cofactors including the transmembrane protein tissue factor and the plasma proteins Factors V and VIII; fibrinogen, the transglutaminase Factor XIII, phospholipid (including activated platelets), and calcium. Additional proteins including kallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen, and Factor XII are required for some in vitro clotting tests, and may play a role in vivo under pathologic conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In hemophilia, blood clotting is disturbed by a lack of certain plasma blood clotting factors. Hemophilia B is caused by a deficiency in Factor IX that may result from either the decreased synthesis of the Factor IX protein or a defective molecule with reduced activity. Without effective prophylaxis, recurrent haemarthroses lead to the development of progressive and disabling arthropathy and poor quality of life (Giangrande P., Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2005; 6:1517-24). The treatment of hemophilia occurs by replacement of the missing clotting factor by exogenous factor concentrates highly enriched in Factor IX. However, generating such a concentrate from blood is fraught with technical difficulties, as is described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Purification of Factor IX from plasma (plasma derived Factor IX; pdFIX) almost exclusively yields active Factor IX. However, such purification of factor IX from plasma is very difficult because Factor IX is only present in low concentration in plasma (5 ug/mL). Andersson, Thrombosis Research 7: 451 459 (1975). Further, purification from blood requires the removal or inactivation of infectious agents such as HIV and HCV. In addition, pdFIX has a short half-life and therefore requires frequent dosing, which contributes to reduced adherence to prophylactic treatment. Recombinant factor IX (rFIX) is also available, but suffers from the same short half-life and need for frequent dosing (e.g., 2-3 times per week for prophylaxis) as pdFIX. rFIX also has a lower incremental recovery (K value) compared to pdFIX, which necessitates the use of higher doses of rFIX than those for pdFIX.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Reduced mortality, prevention of joint damage and improved quality of life have been important achievements due to the development of plasma-derived and recombinant Factor IX. Prolonged protection from bleeding would represent another key advancement in the treatment of hemophilia B subjects. However, to date, no products that allow for prolonged protection have been developed. The relatively short-half-lives of currently available FIX products require frequent intravenous injections (2-3 times weekly), which reduces adherence to prophylaxis. See White G. C., et al., <i>Thrombosis and Haemostasis </i>78: 261-5: 1997. In children, the use of central venous access devices (CVAD) is often required, which further exposes them to risks of infection and thrombosis. See Hacker M. R, et al., <i>Hemophilia, </i>10: 134-46 (2004). A serious potential risk associated rFIX treatment is the development of inhibitors (neutralizing antibodies), which typically occur within the first 50 exposure days (EDs). Inhibitors pose a challenge to establishing hemostasis and can be associated with anaphylaxis. See Chitlur M., et al., <i>Hemophilia, </i>15: 1027-31 (2009). Therefore, there remains a need for improved methods of treating hemophilia due to Factor IX deficiency that are more tolerable and more effective than current therapies.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The present invention provides a method of treating FIX deficiency, e.g., Hemophilia B, with FIX using a longer dosing interval, a longer dosing frequency, and/or improved pharmacokinetic parameters than is possible with currently known Factor IX products. The present invention also provides improved, long-acting FIX polypeptides, FIX chimeric polynucleotides, and methods of production.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">I. DEFINITIONS</heading>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The term âaboutâ is used herein to mean approximately, roughly, around, or in the regions of. When the term âaboutâ is used in conjunction with a numerical range, it modifies that range by extending the boundaries above and below the numerical values set forth. in general, the term âaboutâ is used herein to modify a numerical value above and below the stated value by a variance of 10 percent, up or down (higher or lower).</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The term âpolypeptide,â âpeptideâ and âproteinâ are used interchangeably and refer to a polymeric compound comprised of covalently linked amino acid residues.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The term âpolynucleotideâ and ânucleic acidâ are used interchangeably and refer to a polymeric compound, comprised of covalently linked nucleotide residues. Polynucleotides can be DNA, cDNA, RNA, single stranded, or double stranded, vectors, plasmids, phage, or viruses. Polynucleotides include those in Table 18, which encode the polypeptides of Table 19 (see Table 18). Polynucleotides also include fragments of the polynucleotides of Table 18, e.g., those that encode fragments of the polypeptides of Table 19, such as the Factor IX, Fc, signal sequence, propeptide, 6His and other fragments of the polypeptides of Table 19.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">The term âadministering,â as used herein, means to or prescribe or give a pharmaceutically acceptable long-acting FIX polypeptide of the invention to a subject via a pharmaceutically acceptable route. Examples of routes of administration include, but are not limited to, intravenous, e.g., intravenous injection and intravenous infusion, e.g., via central venous access. Additional routes of administration include subcutaneous, intramuscular, oral, nasal, and pulmonary administration, preferably subcutaneous. A long-acting FIX polypeptides (a FIX chimeric or hybrid proteins) can be administered as part of a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one excipient. Advantages of the present invention include: improved regimen compliance; reduced break through bleeds; increased protection of joints from bleeds; prevention of joint damage; reduced morbidity; reduced mortality; prolonged protection from bleeding; decreased thrombotic events; and improved quality of life.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">The term âchimeric polypeptide,â as used herein, means a polypeptide that includes within it at least two polypeptides (or portions thereof such as subsequences or peptides) from different sources. Chimeric polypeptides can include two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more polypeptides or portions thereof from different sources, such as different genes, different cDNAs, or different animal or other species. Chimeric polypeptides can include one or more linkers joining the different polypeptides or portions thereof. Thus, the polypeptides or portions thereof can be joined directly or they can be joined indirectly, via linkers, or both, within a single chimeric polypeptide. Chimeric polypeptides can include additional peptides such as signal sequences and sequences such as 6His and FLAG that aid in protein purification or detection. In addition, chimeric polypeptides can have amino acid or peptide additions to the N- and/or C-termini Exemplary chimeric polypeptides of the invention are Factor IX-FcRn BP chimeric polypeptides, e.g., Factor IX-Fc chimeric polypeptides such as the FIXFc in SEQ ID NO:2 (Table 19) with or without its signal sequence and propeptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The terms âlong-actingâ and âlong-lastingâ are used interchangeably herein. In one embodiment the term âlong-actingâ or âlong-lastingâ indicates, that a FIX activity as a result of administration of the âlong-actingâ FIX polypeptide is longer than the FIX activity of a wild-type FIX (e.g., BENEFIXÂ® or plasma-derived FIX (âpdFIXâ)). The âlongerâ FIX activity can be measured by any known methods in the art, e.g., aPTT assay, chromogenic assay, ROTEM, TGA, and etc. In one embodiment, the âlongerâ FIX activity can be shown by the T<sub>1/2beta </sub>(activity). In another embodiment, the âlongerâ FIX activity can be shown the level of FIX antigen present in plasma, e.g., by the T<sub>1/2beta </sub>(antigen). In other embodiments, the long-acting or long-lasting FIX polypeptide works longer in a coagulation cascade, e.g., is active for a longer period, compared to a wild-type FIX polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide consisting of amino acids 1 to 415 of SEQ ID NO 2, i.e., BENEFIXÂ® or pdFIX).</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">Factor IX coagulant activity is expressed as International Unit(s) (IU). One IU of Factor IX activity corresponds approximately to the quantity of Factor IX in one milliliter of normal human plasma. Several assays are available for measuring Factor IX activity, including the one stage clotting assay (activated partial thromboplastin time; aPTT), thrombin generation time (TGA) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEMÂ®).</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">The term âlyophilisateâ (also can be used interchangeably with âlyophilizateâ) as used herein in connection with the formulation according to the invention denotes a formulation which is manufactured by freeze-drying methods, known in the art per se. The solvent (e.g. water) is removed by freezing following sublimation under vacuum and desorption, of residual water at elevated temperature. In the pharmaceutical field, the lyophilisate usually has a residual moisture of about 0.1 to 5% (w/w) and is present as a powder or a physical stable cake. The lyophilisate is characterized by a fast dissolution after addition of a reconstitution medium.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">The term âreconstituted formulationâ as used herein denotes a formulation which is lyophilized and re-dissolved by addition of a diluent. The diluent can contain, without limitation, water for injection (WFI), bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), sodium chloride solutions (e.g. 0.9% (w/v) NaCl), glucose solutions (e.g. 5% glucose), surfactant containing solutions (e.g. 0.01% polysorbate 20 or polysorbate 80), a pH-buffered solution (e.g. phosphate-buffered solutions) and combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">âDosing intervalâ, as used herein, means the amount of time that elapses between multiple doses being administered to a subject. Dosing interval can thus be indicated as ranges. The dosing interval in the methods of the invention using a chimeric FIX-FcRn BP, e.g., a chimeric FIX-Fc, can be at least about one and one-half to eight times longer than the dosing interval required for an equivalent amount (in IU/kg) of said Factor IX without the FcRn BP, e.g., Fc portion (i.e., a polypeptide consisting of said FIX). The dosing interval when administering, e.g., a Factor IX-Fc chimeric polypeptide (or a hybrid) of the invention can be at least about one and one-half times longer than the dosing interval required for an equivalent amount of said Factor IX without the FeRn BP, e.g., Fc, portion (i.e., a polypeptide consisting of said Factor IX). The dosing interval can be at least about one and one-half to eight times longer than the dosing interval required for an equivalent amount of said Factor IX without, e.g., the Fc portion (or a polypeptide consisting of said Factor IX).</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The term âdosing frequencyâ as used herein refers to the frequency of administering doses of a long-acting FIX polypeptide in a given time Dosing frequency can be indicated as the number of doses per a given time, e.g., once a week or once in two weeks.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">The term âbleeding episodeâ as used herein is given a standardized definition: A bleeding episode starts from the first sign of a bleed, and ends 72 hours after the last treatment for the bleeding, within which any symptoms of bleeding at the same location, or injections less than or equal to 72 hours apart, is considered the same bleeding episode. See Blanchette V. (2006) <i>Haemophilia </i>12:124-7. As used herein, any injection to treat the bleeding episode, taken more than 72 hours after the preceding one, is considered the first injection to treat a new bleeding episode at the same location. Likewise, any bleeding at a different location is considered a separate bleeding episode regardless of time from the last injection.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The term âprophylaxis of one or more bleeding episodeâ or âprophylactic treatmentâ as used herein means administering a Factor IX polypeptide in multiple doses to a subject over a course of time to increase the level of Factor IX activity in a subjects plasma. In one embodiment, âprophylaxis of one or more bleeding episodeâ indicates use of a long-acting FIX polypeptide to prevent or inhibit occurrence of one or more spontaneous or uncontrollable bleeding or bleeding episodes or to reduce the frequency of one or more spontaneous or uncontrollable bleeding, or bleeding episodes. In another embodiment, the increased FIX activity level is sufficient to decrease the incidence of spontaneous bleeding or to prevent bleeding in the event of an unforeseen injury. Prophylactic treatment decreases or prevents bleeding episodes, for example, those described under on-demand treatment. Prophylactic treatment can be individualized, as discussed under dosing interval, e.g., to compensate for inter-subject variability.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The term âabout once a weekâ as used herein means approximate number, and âabout once a weekâ can include every seven daysÂ±two days, i.e., every five days to every nine days. The dosing frequency of âonce a weekâ thus can be every five days, every six days, every seven days, every eight days, or every nine days.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The term âindividualized interval prophylaxisâ as used herein means use of a long-acting FIX polypeptide for an individualized dosing interval or frequency to prevent or inhibit occurrence of one or more spontaneous and/or uncontrollable bleeding or bleeding episodes or to reduce the frequency of one or more spontaneous and/or uncontrollable bleeding or bleeding episodes. In one embodiment, the individualized interval includes every 10 days Â±3 days, i.e. every seven days to every 13 days. The dosing frequency of the individualized interval prophylaxis thus can be every seven days, every eight days, every nine days, every ten days, every 11 days, every 12 days, or every 13 days.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The term âon-demand treatment,â as used herein, means treatment that is intended to take place over a short course of time and is in response to an existing condition, such as a bleeding episode, or a perceived short term need such as planned surgery. The âon-demand treatmentâ is used interchangeably with âepisodicâ treatment. Conditions that can require on-demand treatment include a bleeding, episode, hemarthrosis, muscle bleed, oral bleed, hemorrhage, hemorrhage into muscles, oral hemorrhage, trauma, trauma capitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, intrathoracic hemorrhage, bone fracture, central nervous system bleeding, bleeding in the retropharyngeal space, bleeding in the retroperitoneal space, or bleeding in the illiopsoas sheath. Bleeding episodes other than these are also included. The subject can be in need of surgical prophylaxis, peri-operative management, or treatment for surgery. Such surgeries include minor surgery, major surgery, tooth extraction, tonsillectomy, other dental/thoraco-facial surgeries, inguinal herniotomy, synovectomy, total knee replacement, other joint replacement, craniotomy, osteosynthesis, trauma surgery, intracranial surgery, intra-abdominal surgery, intrathoracic surgery. Surgeries other than these are also included.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">Additional conditions that can require on-demand treatment include minor hemorrhage, hemarthroses, superficial muscle hemorrhage, soft tissue hemorrhage, moderate hemorrhage, intramuscle or soft tissue hemorrhage with dissection, mucous membrane hemorrhage, hematuria, major hemorrhage, hemorrhage of the pharynx, hemorrhage of the retropharynx, hemorrhage of the retroperitonium, hemorrhage of the central nervous system, bruises, cuts, scrapes, joint hemorrhage, nose bleed, mouth bleed, gum bleed, intracranial bleeding, intraperitoneal bleeding, minor spontaneous hemorrhage, bleeding after major trauma, moderate skin bruising, or spontaneous hemorrhage into joints, muscles, internal organs or the brain. Additional reasons for on-demand treatment include the need for peri-operative management for surgery or dental extraction, major surgery, extensive oral surgery, urologic surgery, hernia surgery, orthopedic surgery such as replacement of knee, hip, or other major joint.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">The term âtreatmentâ or âtreatingâ as used herein means amelioration or reduction of one or more symptoms of bleeding diseases or disorders including, but not limited to, hemophilia B. In one embodiment, âtreatment ofâ or âtreatingâ a bleeding disease or disorder includes prevention of one or more symptoms of a bleeding disease or disorder. In a bleeding disease or disorder caused by a FIX deficiency (e.g. a low baseline FIX activity), the term âtreatmentâ or âtreatingâ means a FIX replacement therapy. By administering a long-acting FIX polypeptide to a subject, the subject can, achieve and/or maintain a plasma trough level of a FIX activity at about 1 IU/dl or above 1 IU/dl. In other embodiments, âtreatmentâ or âtreatingâ means reduction of the frequency of one or more symptoms of bleeding diseases or disorders, e.g., spontaneous or uncontrollable bleeding episodes. âTreatment,â however, need not be a cure.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">The term âperioperative managementâ as used herein means use of a long-acting FIX polypeptide before., concurrently with, or after an operative procedure, e.g., a surgical operation. The use for âperioperative managementâ of one or more bleeding episode includes surgical prophylaxis before (i.e., preoperative), during (i.e., intraoperative), or after (i.e., postoperative) a surgery to prevent one or more bleeding or bleeding episode or reducing or inhibiting spontaneous and/or uncontrollable bleeding episodes before, during, and after a surgery.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters include the terms above and the following terms, which have their ordinary meaning in the art, unless otherwise indicated. Some of the terms are explained in more detail in the Examples. PK parameters can be based on FIX antigen level (often denoted parenthetically herein as âantigenâ) or FIX activity level (often denoted parenthetically herein as âactivityâ). In the literature, PK parameters are often based on FIX activity level due to the presence in the plasma of some subjects of endogenous, inactive FIX, which interferes with the ability to measure administered (i.e., exogenous) FIX using antibody against FIX. However, when FIX is administered as part of a fusion or hybrid protein containing a heterologous polypeptide such as an FcRn BP, administered (i.e., exogenous) FIX antigen can be accurately measured using antibody to the heterologous polypeptide. In addition, certain PK parameters can be based on model predicted data (often denoted parenthetically herein as âmodel predictedâ) or on observed data (often denoted parenthetically herein as âobservedâ), and preferably are based on observed data.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">âBaseline,â as used herein, is the lowest measured plasma Factor IX level in a subject prior to administering a dose. The Factor IX plasma levels can be measured at two time points prior to dosing: at a screening visit and immediately prior to dosing. Alternatively, (a) the baseline in subjects whose pretreatment FIX activity is &lt;1%, who have no detectable FIX antigen, and have nonsense genotypes can be defined as 0%, (b) the baseline for subjects with pretreatment FIX activity &lt;1% and who have detectable FIX antigen can be set at 0.5%, (c) the baseline for subjects whose pretreatment FIX activity is between 1-2% is Cmin (the lowest activity throughout the PK, study), and (d) the baseline for subjects whose pretreatment FIX activity is â§2% can be set at 2%. Activity above the baseline pre-dosing can be considered residue drug from prior treatment, and can be decayed to baseline and subtracted from the PK data following rFIXFc dosing.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">âT<sub>1/2</sub>,â or âT<sub>1/2 beta</sub>â or âBeta HL,â as used herein, is half-life associated with elimination phase, t<sub>1/2Î²</sub>=(ln2)/elimination rate constant associated with the terminal phase. The T<sub>1/2 beta </sub>can be measured by FIX activity or by FIX antigen level in plasma. The T<sub>1/2 beta </sub>based on activity is shown as T<sub>1/2 beta </sub>(activity), and the T<sub>1/2 beta </sub>based on the FIX antigen level can be shown as T<sub>1/2 beta </sub>(antigen). Both T<sub>1/2 beta </sub>(activity) and T<sub>1/2 beta </sub>(antigen) can be shown as ranges or a geometric mean.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">âTrough,â as used herein, is the lowest plasma Factor IX activity level reached after administering a dose of chimeric polypeptide of the invention or another Factor IX molecule and before the next dose is administered, if any Trough is used interchangeably herein with âthreshold.â Baseline Factor IX levels are subtracted from measured Factor IX levels to calculate the trough level.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">The term âannualized bleeding rateâ (âABR) as used herein refers to the number of bleeding episodes (including spontaneous and traumatic bleeds) experienced by a subject during a defined time period, extrapolated to 1 year. For example two bleeds in six months would indicate an ABR of four. The median ABR provides a single number to describe all subjects, indicating that half of the subjects had individual ABRs less than or equal to the median and half had ABRs greater than or equal to, the median. For example, an ABR can be calculated according to the following formula:</p>

      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0115">A long-acting or long-lasting FIX polypeptide useful for the invention is a chimeric polypeptide comprising a FIX polypeptide and an FcRn binding partner. In certain embodiments, the rFIXFc is a fusion protein comprising a single molecule of human recombinant coagulation FIX (rFIX) covalently linked to the dimeric Fc domain of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) with no intervening sequence. The FIX polypeptide of the invention comprises a functional Factor IX polypeptide in its normal role in coagulation, unless otherwise specified. Thus, the FIX polypeptide includes variant polypeptides that are functional and the polynucleotides that encode such functional variant polypeptides. In one embodiment, the FIX polypeptides are the human, bovine, porcine, canine, feline, and murine FIX polypeptides. The full length polypeptide and polynucleotide sequences of FIX are known, as are many functional variants, e.g., fragments, mutants and modified versions. FIX polypeptides include full-length FIX, full-length FIX minus Met at the N-terminus, full-length FIX minus the signal sequence, mature FIX (minus the signal sequence and propeptide), and mature FIX with an additional Met at the N-terminus. FIX can be made by recombinant means (ârecombinant Factor IXâ or ârFIXâ), i.e., it is not naturally occurring or derived from plasma.</p>

      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0120">FcRn binding partner (âFcRn BPâ) comprises functional neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding partners, unless otherwise specified. An FcRn binding partner is any molecule that can be specifically bound by the FcRn receptor with consequent active transport by the FcRn receptor of the FcRn binding partner. Thus, the term FcRn BP includes any variants of IgG Fc that are functional. For example, the region of the Fc portion of IgG that binds to the FcRn receptor has been descried based on X-ray crystallography (Burmeister et al. 1994, Nature 372:379, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The major contact area of the Fc with the FcRn is near the junction of the CH2 and CH3 domains. Fc-FcRn contacts are all within a single Ig heavy chain. FcRn BPs include whole IgG, the Fc fragment of IgG, and other fragments of IgG that include the complete binding region of FcRn. The major contact sites include amino acid residues 248, 250-257, 272, 285, 288, 290-291, 308-311, and 314 of the CH2 domain and amino acid residues 385-387, 428, and 433-436 of the CH3 domain. References made to amino acid numbering of immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments, or regions, are all based on Kabat et al. 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of Public Health, Bethesda; MD, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. (The FcRn receptor has been isolated from several mammalian species including humans. The sequences of the human FcRn, rat. RcRn, and mouse FcRn are known (Story et al. 1994, J. Exp. Med. 180: 2377), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.) An FcRn BP can comprise the CH2 and CH3 domains of an immunoglobulin with or without the hinge region of the immunoglobulin. Exemplary FcRn BP variants are provided in WO 2004/101740 and WO 2006/074199, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>

      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0123">FcRn BP (or FcRn BP portion of a chimeric polypeptide) can also include the following, mutations: The Fc region of IgG can be modified according to well recognized procedures such as site directed mutagenesis and the like to yield modified IgG or Fc fragments or portions thereof that will be bound by FcRn. Such modifications include modifications remote from the FcRn contact sites as well as modifications within the contact sites that preserve or even enhance binding to the FcRn. For example the following, single amino acid residues in human IgG1 Fc (Fcy1) can be substituted without significant loss of Fc binding affinity for FcRn: P238A, S239A, K246A, K248A, D249A, M252A, T256A, E258A, T260A, D265A, S267A, H268A, E269A, D270A, E272A, L274A, N276A, Y278A, D280A, V282A, E283A, H285A, N286A, T289A, K290A, R292A, E293A, E294A, Q295A, Y296F, N297A, S298A, Y300F, R301A, V303A, V305A, T307A, L309A, Q311A, D312A, N315A, K317A, E318A, K320A, K322A, S324A, K326A, A327Q, P329A, A330Q, A330S, P331A, P331S, E333A, K334A, T335A, S337A, K338A, K340A, Q342A, R344A, E345A, Q347A, R355A, E356A, M358A, T359A, K360A, N361A, Q362A, Y373A, S375A D376A, A378Q, E380A, E382A, S383A, N384A, Q386A, E388A, N389A, N390A, Y391F, K392A, L398A, S400A, D401A, D413A, K414A, R416A, Q418A, Q419A, N421A, V422A, S424A, E430A, N434A, T437A, Q438A, K439A, S440A, S444A, and K447A, where for example P238A represents wild type proline substituted by alanine at position number 238. In addition to alanine other amino acids can be substituted for the wild type amino acids at the positions specified above. Mutations can be introduced singly into Fc giving rise to more than one hundred FcRn binding partners distinct from native Fc. Additionally, combinations of two, three, or more of these individual mutations can be introduced together, giving rise to hundreds more FcRn binding partners. Certain of these mutations can confer new functionality upon the FcRn binding partner. For example, one embodiment incorporates N297A, removing a highly conserved N-glycosylation site. The effect of this mutation is to reduce immunogenicity, thereby enhancing, circulating half-life of the FcRn binding partner, and to render the FcRn binding partner incapable of binding to FcyRI, FcyRIIA, FcyRIIB, and FcyRIIIA, without compromising affinity for FcRn (Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; Friend et al. 1999, Transplantation 68:1632, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; Shields et al. 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Additionally, at least three human Fc gamma receptors appear to recognize a binding site on IgG within the lower hinge region, generally amino acids 234-237. Therefore, another example of new functionality and potential decreased immunogenicity can arise from mutations of this region, as for example by replacing amino acids 233-236 of human IgG1 âELLGâ to the corresponding sequence from IgG2 âPVAâ (with one amino acid deletion). It has been shown that FcyRI, FcyRII, and FcyRIII which mediate various effector functions will not bind to IgG1 when such mutations have been introduced (Ward and Ghetie 1995, Therapeutic Immunology 2:77, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; and Armour et al. 1999, Eur.

As a further example of new functionality arising from mutations described above, affinity for FcRn can Le increased beyond that of wild type in some instances. This increased affinity can reflect an increased on rate, a decreased âoffâ rate or both an increased âonâ rate and a decreased âoffâ rate. Mutations believed to impart an increased affinity for FcRn include T256A, T307A, E380A., and N434A (Shields et al. 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). 0122 The FeRn BP (or FcRn BP portion of a chimeric polypeptide) can be at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100% identical to the Fc amino acid sequence shown in Table 19A or B without a signal sequence (amino acids 1 to 227 of SEQ ID NO:2), or alternatively, with a signal sequence.</p>

      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0125">A long-acting or long-lasting FIX polypeptide can be a hybrid FIX polypeptide. Hybrid FIX polypeptide means a combination of a FIX chimeric polypeptide with a second polypeptide. The chimeric polypeptide and the second polypeptide in a hybrid can be associated with each other via non-covalent protein-protein interactions, such as charge-charge or hydrophobic interactions. The chimeric polypeptide and the second polypeptide in a hybrid can be associated with each other via covalent bond(s) such as disulfide bonds. The chimeric peptide and the second peptide can be associated with each other via more than one type of bond, such as non-covalent and disulfide bonds. Hybrids are described in WO 2004/101740, WO 2005/001025, U.S. Pat. No. 7,404,956, U.S. Pat. No. 7,348,004, and WO 2006/074199, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The second polypeptide can be a second copy of the same chimeric polypeptide or it can be a non-identical chimeric polypeptide. In other embodiments, the second polypeptide is a polypeptide comprising an FcRn BP, e.g., Fc. In some embodiments, the chimeric polypeptide is a Factor IX-FcRn BP, e.g., Factor IX-Fc chimeric polypeptide, and the second polypeptide consists essentially of Fc.

Polynucleotides which hybridize to these nucleic acid molecules under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency conditions are also included as variants, as are polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides as long as they are functional.</p>

In other words, to obtain a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence at least 95% identical to a reference nucleotide, sequence, up to 5% of the nucleotides in the reference sequence can be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide, or a number of nucleotides up to 5% of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence can be inserted into the reference sequence. The query sequence can be, for example, the entire sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1 or 3, the ORF (open reading frame), or any fragment specified as described herein.</p>

A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence (reference or original sequence) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. (Comp. App. Biosci. (1990) 6:237-245), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are both DNA sequences. An RNA sequence can be compared by converting U's to T's. The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity are Matrix=Unitary, k-tuple=4, Mismatch Penalty=1, Joining Penalty=30, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff Score=1, Gap Penalty=5, Gap Size Penalty 0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject nucleotide sequence, whichever is shorter.</p>

This is because the FASTDB program does not account for 5â² and 3â² truncations of the subject sequence when calculating percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the 5â² or 3â² ends, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of bases of the query sequence that are 5â² and 3â² of the subject sequence, which are not, matched/aligned, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a nucleotide is matched/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This corrected score is what is used for the purposes of the present invention. Only bases outside the 5â² and 3â² bases of the subject sequence, as displayed by the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence, are calculated for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0132">For example, a 90 base subject sequence is aligned to a 100 base query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletions occur at the 5â² end of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matched/alignment of the first 10 bases at 5â² end. The 10 unpaired bases represent 10% of the sequence (number of bases at the 5â² and 3â² ends not matched/total number of bases in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 bases were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 base subject sequence is compared with a 100 base query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so that there are no bases on the 5â² or 3â² of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only bases 5â² and 3â² of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are to made for the purposes of the present invention.</p>

In other words, to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a query amino acid sequence, up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the subject sequence can be inserted, deleted, (indels) or substituted with another amino acid. These alterations of the reference sequence can occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.</p>

For subject sequences truncated at the N- and C-termini, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N- and C-terminal of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned with a corresponding subject residue, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence.

      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0137">The polynucleotide variants can contain alterations in the coding regions, non-coding regions, or both. Especially preferred are polynucleotide variants containing alterations which produce silent substitutions, additions, or deletions, but do not alter the properties or activities of the encoded polypeptide. Nucleotide variants produced by silent substitutions due to the degeneracy of the genetic code are preferred. Moreover, variants in which 5-10, 1-5, or 1-2 amino acids are substituted, deleted, or added in any combination are also preferred. Polynucleotide variants can be produced for a variety of reasons, e.g., to optimize codon expression for a particular host (change codons in the human mRNA to those preferred by a bacterial host such as <i>E. coli</i>).</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0138">Naturally occurring variants are called âallelic variantsâ, and refer to one of several alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome of an organism (Genes II, Lewin, B., ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1985)). These allelic variants can vary at either the polynucleotide and/or polypeptide level and are included in the present invention. Alternatively, non-naturally occurring variants can be produced by mutagenesis techniques or by direct synthesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0139">Using known methods of protein engineering and recombinant DNA technology, variants can be generated to improve or alter the characteristics of the polypeptides. For instance, one or more amino acids can be deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus of the secreted protein without substantial loss of biological function. The authors of Ron et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268: 2984-2988 (1993), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, reported variant KGF proteins having heparin binding activity even after deleting 3, 8, or 27 amino-terminal amino acid residues. Similarly, Interferon gamma exhibited up to ten times higher activity after deleting 8-10 amino acid residues from the carboxy terminus of this protein. (Dobeli et al., J. Biotechnology 7:199-216 (1988), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.)</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0140">Moreover, ample evidence demonstrates that variants often retain a biological activity similar to that of the naturally occurring protein. For example, Gayle and coworkers (J. Biol. Chem. 268:22105-22111 (1993), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) conducted extensive mutational analysis of human cytokine IL-1a. They used random mutagenesis to generate over 3,500 individual IL-1a mutants that averaged 2.5 amino acid changes per variant over the entire length of the molecule. Multiple mutations were examined at every possible amino acid position. The investigators found that â[m]ost of the molecule could be altered with little effect on either [binding or biological activity].â (See Abstract.) In fact, only 23 unique amino acid sequences, out of more than 3,500 nucleotide sequences examined, produced a protein that significantly differed in activity from wild type.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0141">As stated above, polypeptide variants include modified polypeptides. Modifications include acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphofidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, pegylation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination.</p>

      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="1">V. METHOD OF MAKING</heading>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0180">A long-acting FIX polypeptide can be manufactured in a host cell comprising a vector encoding the long-acting FIX polypeptide. In one embodiment, the host cell is transformed with one or more vectors comprising a first nucleotide sequence encoding a FIX polypeptide and a first FcRn polypeptide, a second nucleotide sequence encoding a second FcRn polypeptide, and optionally a third nucleotide sequence encoding a protein convertase, e.g., PC5. As used herein, an expression vector refers to any nucleic acid construct which contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of an inserted coding sequence, or in the case of an RNA viral vector, the necessary elements for replication and translation, when introduced into an appropriate host cell. Expression vectors can include plasmids, phagemids, viruses, and derivatives thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0181">A gene expression control sequence as used herein is any regulatory nucleotide sequence, such as a promoter sequence or promoter-enhancer combination, which facilitates the efficient transcription and translation of the coding nucleic acid to which it is operably linked. The gene expression control sequence can, for example, be a mammalian or viral promoter, such, as a constitutive or inducible promoter. Constitutive mammalian promoters include, but are not limited to, the promoters for the following genes: hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), adenosine deaminase, pyruvate kinase, beta-actin promoter, and other constitutive promoters. Exemplary viral promoters which function constitutively in eukaryotic cells include, for example, promoters from the cytomegalovirus (CMV), simian virus (e.g., SV40), papilloma virus, adenovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Rous sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, the long terminal repeats (LTR) of Moloney leukemia virus, and other retroviruses, and the thymidine kinase promoter of herpes simplex virus. Other constitutive promoters are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The promoters useful as gene expression sequences of the invention also include inducible promoters. Inducible promoters are expressed in the presence of an inducing agent. For example, the metallothionein promoter is induced to promote transcription and translation in the presence of certain metal ions. Other inducible promoters are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0182">Examples of vectors include, but are not limited to viral vectors or plasmid vectors. Plasmid vectors have been extensively described in the art and are well-known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989. In the last few years, plasmid vectors have been found to be particularly advantageous for delivering genes to cells in vivo because of their inability to replicate within and integrate into a host genome. These plasmids, however, having a promoter compatible with the host cell, can express a peptide from a gene operably encoded within the plasmid. Some commonly used plasmids available from commercial suppliers include pBR322, pUC18, pUC19, various pcDNA plasmids, pRC/CMV, various pCMV plasmids, pSV40, and pBlueScript. Additional examples of specific plasmids include pcDNA3.1, catalog number V79020; pcDNA3.1/hygro, catalog number V87020; pcDNA4/myc-His, catalog number V86320; and pBudCE4.1, catalog number V53220, all from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.). Other plasmids are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, plasmids can be custom designed using standard molecular biology techniques to remove and/or add specific fragments of DNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0183">The expression vector or vectors are then transfected or co-transfected into a suitable target cell, which will express the polypeptides. Transfection techniques known in the art include, but are not limited to, calcium phosphate precipitation (Wigler et al. (1978) Cell 14:725), electroporation (Neumann et al. (1982) EMBO J 1:841), and liposome-based reagents. A variety of host-expression vector systems can be utilized to express the proteins described herein including both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. These include, but are not limited to, microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., <i>E. coli</i>) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA or plasmid DNA expression vectors containing an appropriate coding sequence; yeast or filamentous fungi transformed with recombinant yeast or fungi expression vectors containing an, appropriate coding sequence; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing an appropriate coding sequence; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus or tobacco mosaic virus) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e. g, Ti plasmid) containing an appropriate coding sequence; or animal cell systems, including mammalian cells (e.g., HEK 293, CHO, Cos, HeLa, HKB11, and BHK cells).</p>

      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0218">rFIXFc is a long-acting, fully recombinant fusion protein consisting of human coagulation Factor IX (FIX) covalently linked to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). The Factor IX portion of rFIXFc has a primary amino acid sequence that is identical to the Thr<sup>148 </sup>allelic form of plasma derived Factor IX and has structural and functional characteristics similar to endogenous Factor IX. The Fc domain of rFIXFc contains the hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions of IgG1. rFIXFc contains 869 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 98 kilodaltons.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0219">rFIXFc is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line, which has been extensively characterized. The cell line expresses rFIXFc into a defined cell culture medium that does not contain any proteins derived from animal or human sources. rFIXFc is purified by a series of chromatography steps that does not require use of a monoclonal antibody. The process includes multiple viral clearance steps including 15 nm virus-retaining nano-filtration. No human or animal additives are used in the cell culture, purification, and formulation processes.</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0220">rFIXFc is in the pharmacotherapeutic group: antihemorrhagics, B02BD04.

      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0222">The rFIXFc drug product is a sterile lyophilized powder for injection intended for intravenous administration. It is supplied in aseptically filled single use vials which contain nominally 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 IU per vial. The vials are 10 mL USP/Ph. Eur. Type 1 glass vials sealed with a 20 mm Teflon-coated butyl rubber lyophilization stopper and aluminum flip-off crimp seal. Prior to lyophilization, the nominal fill volume target for 250 through 2000 IU vials is 5 mL and 7 mL for the 3000 IU vial. The composition of the formulation excipients prior to lyophilization is the same for all dosage strengths. The powder for injection is reconstituted with 5 mL of diluent comprising 0.325% (w/v) sodium chloride supplied in a sterile prefilled syringe.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0223">The compositions of the drug product solutions prior to lyophilization are presented in Table 3 and composition of the lyophilized powders are presented in Table 4. The compositions of the drug products following reconstitution are presented in Table 1 or in Table 2. (Example 1).</p>

      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0225">rFIXFc is long-acting anti-hemophilic factor (recombinant) indicated in adults and children (â§12 years) with hemophilia B (congenital Factor IX deficiency) for, e.g., control and prevention of bleeding episodes, routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes, and perioperative management (surgical prophylaxis).</p>
      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0226">Dosing of rFIXFc, formulated as described in Example 1, can be estimated as described in this example, but can also be determined by standard tests such as FIX activity assays described elsewhere herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0227">1 IU of rFIXFc per kg body weight is expected to increase the circulating level of Factor IX by 1% [IU/dL]. rFIXFc has been shown to have a prolonged circulating half-life.</p>
      <p id="p-00233-en" num="0228">No dose adjustment for recovery is generally required. Since subjects can vary in their pharmacokinetic (e.g., half-life, in vivo recovery) and clinical responses to rFIXFc, the expected in vivo peak increase in Factor IX level expressed as IU/dL (or % of normal) or the required dose can be estimated using the following formulas:</p>
      <p id="p-00234-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]IU/dL (or % of normal)=[Total Dose (IU)/body weight (kg)]Ãrecovery (IU/dL per IU/kg)[/in-line-formulae]</p>

      <p id="p-00242-en" num="0232">For routine prophylaxis, The recommended starting regimens are either: 50 IU/kg once weekly, or 100 IU/kg once every 10-14 days. Either regimen can be adjusted based on subject response (see Pharmacokinetics, Example 5 below).</p>
      <p id="p-00243-en" num="0233">rFIXFc is contraindicated in subjects who have manifested severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to the product or its components.</p>
      <p id="p-00244-en" num="0234">The clinical response to rFIXFc may vary. If bleeding is not controlled with the recommended dose, the plasma level of Factor IX can be determined, and a sufficient dose of rFIXFc can be administered to achieve a satisfactory clinical response. If the subject's plasma Factor IX level fails to increase as expected or if bleeding is not controlled after rFIXFc administration, the subject's plasma can be tested for the presence of an inhibitor, e.g., neutralizing antibodies. Subjects using rFIXFc can be monitored for the development of Factor IX inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00245-en" num="0235">Subject's plasma can be monitored for Factor IX activity levels by performing, e.g., the one-stage clotting assay to confirm adequate Factor IX levels have been achieved and maintained, when clinically indicated. Subject's plasma can further be monitored for the development of Factor IX inhibitors.</p>

      <heading id="h-00021-en" level="2">B-LONG Study Design</heading>
      <p id="p-00246-en" num="0236">Design of the study is global, open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter (50 investigational sites in 17 countries), Phase 3 study.</p>
      <p id="p-00247-en" num="0237">Objectives is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of intravenously-injected recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) in the control and prevention of bleeding episodes, routine prophylaxis, and/or perioperative management in individuals (previously treated subjects (PTP)) with severe hemophilia B. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows a diagram of the study design. The study disclosed in present example was the largest registrational trial of any therapeutic for hemophilia B, with the most extensive PK analysis conducted to date. The study duration was about 72 weeks.</p>
      <p id="p-00248-en" num="0238">Key inclusion criteria includes (1) male, (2) older than 12 years of age (weighing at least 40 kg), (3) having diagnosis of severe hemophilia B defined as â¦2% (â¦2 IU/dL FIX:C) endogenous factor X activity, (5) having history of â§100 prior documented exposure days (EDs) with any currently marketed FIX product, bleeding events and/or treatment with FIX during the 12 weeks prior to enrollment, or at least 8 bleeds in the 52 weeks prior to enrollment if they had been treated episodically, (6) subjects with a history of inhibitors or anaphylaxis associated with FIX or intravenous immunoglobulin, other coagulation disorders, uncontrolled HIV infection, renal dysfunction, or active severe hepatic disease were excluded from the study, and (7) subjects unable or unwilling to adhere to the prophylaxis regimen or diary requirements or those who had received immunosuppressant drugs â¦12 months prior to the study were also excluded.</p>
      <p id="p-00249-en" num="0239">Three treatment arms are Arm 1 (fixed weekly interval prophylaxis) Arm 2 (individualized interval prophylaxis) Arm 3 (episodic [on-demand regimen] treatment) Arm 4 (perioperative management).</p>
      <p id="p-00250-en" num="0240">Under Arm 1, subjects were treated weekly with an initial dose of 50 IU/kg, which was subsequently adjusted based on PK profile to maintain trough factor levels sufficient to prevent bleeding in order to maintain 1-3 IU/dL above baseline at trough and/or if subjects experienced â§2 spontaneous bleeds over 3 consecutive months. A diagram showing the sequential PK subgroup dosing and PK sampling of Arm 1 is shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. Specifically, adjustments to rFIXFc dose were made based on monitoring of trough at weeks 4, 16, 26, and 39. If the pharmacokinetic values indicated the patient's trough level was 3 IU/dl above baseline or higher at the end of the week, the dose was reduced to target a trough of 1 to 3 IU/dl above baseline. If the pharmacokinetic values indicated the patient's trough level would be less than 1 IU/dl above baseline at the end of the week, the dose was increased to target a trough of 1 to 3 IU/dl above baseline. If the target range could not be achieved, a plasma sample was run to rule out the presence of inhibitors. A repeat trough level was done approximately 1 month after making, any dosage adjustments and was repeated monthly until no additional adjustments were necessary. Only the dose of rFIXFc was adjusted in this treatment arm.</p>
      <p id="p-00251-en" num="0241">Under Arm 2, subjects were treated with 100 IU/kg, at an initial interval of 10 days, which was subsequently adjusted to maintain trough factor levels sufficient to prevent bleeding (interval adjusted, per subject's PK profile to maintain 1-3 IU/dL activity above baseline at trough and/or if subject experienced â§2 spontaneous bleeds over 3 consecutive months). Monitoring took place at weeks 4, 16, 26, and 39 to ensure that this FIX trough level was maintained. Only the interval of rFIXFc was adjusted in this treatment arm.</p>
      <p id="p-00252-en" num="0242">For any patients in arm 1 or arm 2 who experienced unacceptable bleeding, with two or more spontaneous bleeds over 3 consecutive months, the dose (arm 1) or interval (arm 2) were adjusted to target a FIX trough level of 3 to 5 IU/dl above baseline. If unacceptable bleeding did not occur on rFIXFc at a target trough of 3 to 5 IU/dl above baseline, at the investigator's discretion, and after agreement with the sponsor, rFIXFc could be re-adjusted for a target trough of 1 to 3 IU/dl.</p>
      <p id="p-00253-en" num="0243">Under Arm 3, subjects received rFIXFc episodic treatment as needed for bleeding (e.g., 20 IU/kg to 100 IU/kg depending on bleeding severity), Minor bleeding episodes were treated with 20-30 IU/kg, moderate to major bleeding episodes with 25-50 IU/kg, and major to life-threatening bleeding episodes with 50-100 IU/kg to target trough FIX levels of 20-30%, 25-50%, and 50-100%, respectively, based on the patient's pharmacokinetic profile.</p>
      <p id="p-00254-en" num="0244">Under Arm 4, 40-100 IU/kg rFIXFc was administered prior to and following major surgery with dose adjusted to type of surgery; subjects were allowed to enroll directly into the surgery arm, and then move into one of the treatment arms (Arm 1, Arm 2, or Arm 3) post-surgery; or to move into the surgery arm from another arm, during the perioperative period if they required a surgery during the study.</p>
      <p id="p-00255-en" num="0245">Those in Arms 1 and 3 received rFIXFc for up to 52Â±1 weeks of treatment and Arm 2 for up to 50 exposure days (EDs). Subjects on a previous prophylaxis regimen were only entered into Arm 1 or 2, while those previously using episodic treatment could be enrolled into any of the treatment arms.</p>
      <p id="p-00256-en" num="0246">A sequential PK subgroup in Arm 1 received 50 IU/kg rFIX at baseline, followed by a â§5-day washout prior to first administration of rFIXFc. After 120 hours post-injection of rFIX with PK assessment, subjects received a 50 IU/kg of rFIXFc and blood samples were collected over 240 hours for PK profiling. The sequential PK subgroup repeated rFIXFc PK profiling at Week 26. All remaining subjects in the study also underwent non-sequential PK evaluations with rFIXFc for 168-336 hours (7-14 days: Arm 1=10; Arm 2=14; Arm 3=7).</p>
      <p id="p-00257-en" num="0247">For PK Assessment, all subjects in all arms had an initial PK assessment after their first dose of rFIXFc. A subset of subjects from Arm 1 were assigned to a protocol-specified sequential PK subgroup to compare the PK of rFIXFc with recombinant factor IX (rFIX, BeneFIXÂ®) as follows: following a 120-hour washout period, patients in the sequential pharmacokinetic subgroup in arm 1 received an injection of 50 IU/kg recombinant FIX (rFIX, BeneFIXÂ®) and underwent pharmacokinetic sampling up to 96 hours as follows: pre-injection, 10 (Â±2) min, 1 h (Â±15 min), 3 h (Â±15 min), 6 h (Â±15 min), 24 (Â±2) h, 48 (Â±2) h, 72 (Â±3) h, and 96 (Â±3) h from the start of the injection. Each patient had to complete a minimally evaluable pharmacokinetic sampling through 72-hour timepoint to be included in the pharmacokinetics analysis set.</p>
      <p id="p-00258-en" num="0248">After completion of rFIX pharmacokinetic sampling and â§5-day from the last rFIX dose, patients received a dose of 50 IU/kg of rFIX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) with pharmacokinetic assessment over 240 hours. The rFIXFc sampling, was done as follows: pre-injection, 10 (Â±2) min, 1 h (Â±15 min), 3 h (Â±15 min), 6 h (Â±15 min), 24 (Â±2) h, 48 (Â±2) h, 96 (Â±3) h, 144 (Â±3) h, 168 (Â±3) h, 192 (Â±3) h, and 240 (Â±3) h from the start of the injection. Each patient had to complete a minimally evaluable pharmacokinetic sampling through 168-hour timepoint to be included in the pharmacokinetics analysis set. A repeat pharmacokinetic assessment of rFIXFc with the same sampling schedule was also performed at week 26.</p>
      <p id="p-00259-en" num="0249">In arms 1 and 2, the efficacy period started with the date and time of first prophylactic dose following a completed pharmacokinetic sampling period and ended with the last dose administered (for prophylaxis or a Heeding episode) as recorded in the electronic. Case Report Form (eCRF) or electronic diary (eDiary). The efficacy period was interrupted for the repeat pharmacokinetic period in arm 1 (sequential pharmacokinetic subgroup) and for all surgical/rehabilitation periods (for both major and minor surgeries) in arms 1 and 2. The efficacy period continued up to the last dose (for prophylaxis or treatment of a bleeding episode) before the repeat pharmacokinetic dose or up to the last dose (for prophylaxis or treatment of a bleeding episode) before the start of a surgical/rehabilitation period, and then resumed at the next prophylactic dose following the end of the pharmacokinetic or surgical/rehabilitation period.</p>
      <p id="p-00260-en" num="0250">In area 3, the efficacy period started 1 minute following the last pharmacokinetic sampling timepoint and ended with either the date of last contact or the date of the last entry into the eDiary, whichever was later. The efficacy period was interruptedâ² 1 minute before the start of a surgical/rehabilitation period and restarted at 00:01 the day following the end of the surgical/rehabilitation period.</p>
      <p id="p-00261-en" num="0251">Plasma FIX activity was measured by the one-stage (activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]) clotting assay, which was validated for rFIXFc, BeneFIXÂ®, and human FIX in human plasma samples. FIX activity in citrated plasma samples was measured on an MDA 180 coagulation instrument using commercially available aPTT reagents, e.g., Trinity Biotech (Automated APTT [silica-based activator and phospholipid mixture]). Precision BioLogic (CRYOCHECKâ¢ Factor IX-depleted plasma), and normal reference plasma (Precision BioLogic) as a calibrator (LLOQ 1 IU/dl), which has a potency assigned against the World Health Organization 3rd or 4th plasma International Standard. For all three FIX proteins, the accuracy was within 95% to 104%, and the intra- and inter-assay precision was typically within 10%.</p>
      <p id="p-00262-en" num="0252">Neutralizing antibodies were detected as follows: The Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay to detect neutralizing antibodies was performed at screening, baseline, and each visit during study treatment to monitor for the development of an inhibitor. Following the first dose with rFIXFc, inhibitor testing in arms 1 and 2 was conducted at trough at each scheduled clinic visit, with trough defined as a point after the longest interval between scheduled doses. Inhibitor testing in arm 3 was performed following a washout of at least 72 hours (3 days). For new patients entering arm 4, inhibitor testing was performed at screening and after a total of at least 4 EDs were achieved with rFIXFc, within 4 weeks prior to scheduled surgery. Formation of an inhibitor was defined as a neutralizing antibody value â§0.6 Bethesda units (BU)/ml, confirmed in a second, separately drawn sample within 2-4 weeks. The confidence interval on the inhibitor incidence rate was evaluated using the Clopper-Pearson exact method for a binomial proportion.</p>
      <p id="p-00263-en" num="0253">Key efficacy outcome measures include (1) annualized bleeding rate (ABR) in Arms 1, 2, and 3 (comparing each of 2 prophylaxis cohorts with the episodic (on-demand) treatment cohort) (i.e., (a) weekly prophylaxis arm (Arm 1) compared with the episodic treatment arm (Arm 3) and (b) individualized interval prophylaxis arm (Arm 2) compared with the episodic treatment arm (Arm 3); (2) response to treatment of bleeding episodes using four-point bleeding response scale (i.e., (a) consumption per subject; (b) weekly dose for Arm 1; (c) dosing interval for Arm 2; and (d) number of injections and dose per injection required to stop a bleeding episode; and (3) treating physicians' assessments of subjects' response to surgery with rFIXFc using a 4-point scale; number of injections and dose required to maintain hemostasis during the surgical period; estimated blood loss during surgery; and number of transfusions required for fol=surgery. For the annualized bleeding rate measurements.</p>
      <p id="p-00264-en" num="0254">Pharmacokinetic (PK) outcome measures include the followings: (1) PK profiles were assessed by a user-defined 2-compartmental model based on the decay of plasma FIX activity over time as measured by the one-stage (activated partial thromboplastin time) clotting assay in a central laboratory and verified for use in the PK analysis and (2) PK of rFIXFc and recombinant factor IX (rFIX, BENEFIXÂ®) and time to 1% above baseline.</p>
      <p id="p-00265-en" num="0255">For FIX activity pharmacokinetic analysis, the baseline (endogenous FIX activity) was pre-defined as the lowest observed FIX activity at either screening, pre-dose, post-dose, or from the patient's historical clinical records. For patients whose lowest observed FIX activity was below 1%, the baseline FIX activity was set as zero; for patients whose lowest observed FIX activity was between 1 and 2 IU/dl, the baseline FIX activity was set at the actual observed FIX value. The residual drug was decayed following first order decay with the decay rates determined on an individual basis. The FIX activity over time profiles, corrected by baseline and residual drug, were analyzed using a user-defined and verified two-compartmental model. The user-defined code automated the calculation of additional secondary pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., Time 1% and 3%), which are not included in the secondary parameter list of the WinNonlin library mode (PHOENIXÂ® WinNonlin 6.2.1.51; Pharsight), thus eliminating the need for manual handling of data outside of the primary analysis and minimizing the risk of introducing human error.</p>
      <p id="p-00266-en" num="0256">Key safety outcome measures include the followings: (a) clinically significant changes from baseline in laboratory values; (b) incidence of inhibitor development; and (c) incidence of adverse events (AEs) occurring outside of the perioperative management arm (Arms 1, 2, and 3 but not 4).</p>
      <p id="p-00267-en" num="0257">Statistical Analysis: Median annualized bleeding rates (ABR) were reported and estimated ABR was calculated using a negative binomial model, which accounted for over-dispersion, to compare ABR between Arms 1 and 2 (prophylaxis regimens) and Arm 3 (episodic treatment). Descriptive statistics were used to provide median and interquartile range (IQR) values for each of arms 1-3. The sequential PK analysis population included Arm 1 subjects with blood samples collected through a minimum of 72 hours from the start of the injection for 50 IU/kg rFIX and a minimum of 168 hours for 50 IU/kg rFIXFc. An analysis of variance model (ANOVA) with variables for study treatment (rFIX or rFIXFc) and subject was used and 95% confidence intervals were provided for geometric means for each treatment. The study was sufficiently powered to detect statistical significance for the occurrence of inhibitors, based FDA guidance that the occurrence of inhibitors in a clinical study can be adequately modeled using the binomial distribution that results in a 2-sided, 95% CI for the true inhibitor incidence of (0.05% to 10.65%) using the exact, Clopper-Pearson method. All statistical tests were performed at the two-sided, 5% significance level. The study was terminated following an interim analysis when prespecified number of major surgical procedures had been completed.</p>

      <p id="p-00271-en" num="0264">Of the 48 subjects on a previous prophylaxis regimen, &gt;80% were infusing â§2 times weekly. Subjects in the prophylaxis cohorts (Arms 1 and 2) were well balanced for prior regimen and bleeding history. There were fewer subjects with target joints in Arm 2 and more subjects with a baseline FIX activity &lt;1 IU/dL in Arm 3. The median (minimum, maximum) durations of treatment in arms 1, 2, and 3 were 51.6 (&lt;1, 97), 58.3 (&lt;1, 126), and 40.9 (28, 54) weeks, respectively, and the median (minimum, maximum) days of exposure were 55.0 (1, 105), 38.0 (1, 71), and 16.0 (4, 35), respectively. A total of 5243 of rFIXFc injections were administered during this study, corresponding to 5144 EDs (117.1 patient-years of exposure). Treatment adherence, in subjects who were â§80% compliant with their prescribed dose (Arm 1) or dosing interval (Arm 2), was 96.6% overall in the prophylaxis arms (Arm 1=95.1%, Arm 2=100%).</p>
      <p id="p-00272-en" num="0265">For patients in arm 4, major surgery was defined as any surgical procedure (elective or emergent) that usually, but not always, involves general anesthesia and/or respiratory assistance in which a major body cavity is penetrated and exposed, or a substantial impairment of physical or physiological functions is produced (e.g., laparotomy, thoracotomy, craniotomy, joint replacement, or limb amputation).</p>

      <p id="p-00273-en" num="0266">For arms 1-3, study visits occurred at screening (8 weeks), baseline, week 4, week 16, week 26, week 39, and week 52. Additionally, patients in arms 1-3 had a 30-day follow-up phone call, unless they enrolled in the ongoing extension study (NCT01425723). Patients in arm 4 had study visits at screening, baseline, the day of surgery, 1 week after surgery, and 1 week post-recovery.</p>

      <p id="p-00274-en" num="0267">Length of sampling times for rFIX and rFIXFc were based upon previously reported half-lives, allowing sufficient time for decay (normally three to five times the previously observed half-life) for accurate description of pharmacokinetics. Following a 120-hour washout period, patients in the sequential pharmacokinetic subgroup in arm 1 received an injection of 50 IU/kg recombinant FIX (rFIX) and underwent pharmacokinetic sampling up to 96 hours as follows: pre-injection, 10 (Â±2) min, 1 h (Â±15 min), 3 h (Â±15 min), 6 h (Â±15 min), 24 (Â±2) h, 48 (Â±2) h, 72 (Â±3) h, and 96 (Â±3) h from the start of the injection. Each patient had to complete a minimally evaluable pharmacokinetic sampling through 72-Lour timepoint to be included in the pharmacokinetics analysis set.</p>
      <p id="p-00275-en" num="0268">After completion of rFIX pharmacokinetic sampling and â§5-day from the last rFIX dose, patients received a dose of 50 IU/kg of rFIX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) with pharmacokinetic assessment over 240 hours. The rFIXFc sampling was done as follows: pre-injection, 10 (Â±2) min, 1 h (Â±15 min), 3 h (Â±15 min), 6 h (Â±15 min), 24 (Â±2) h, 48 (Â±2) h, 96 (Â±3) h, 144 (Â±3) h, 168 (Â±3) h, 192 (Â±3) h, and 240 (Â±3) h from the start of the injection. Each patient had to complete a minimally evaluable pharmacokinetic sampling through 168-hour timepoint to be included in they pharmacokinetics analysis set. A repeat pharmacokinetic assessment of rFIXFc with the same sampling schedule was also performed at week 26.</p>
      <heading id="h-00026-en" level="2">Efficacy</heading>
      <p id="p-00276-en" num="0269">In total, 119 subjects were included in the efficacy analysis. Median annualized th th bleeding rate (ABR) with the 25<sup>th </sup>and 75<sup>th </sup>percentiles (interquartile range (IQR)), which were driven primarily by spontaneous bleeds, were determined for Arms 1, 2, and 3 as shown in <figref>FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, and Table 8 and summarized below: <ul id="ul-00003-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00004-en" list-style="none"><li>Weekly prophylaxis arm (Arm 1): 2.95 (1.01-4.35)</li><li>Individualized interval prophylaxis arm (Arm 2): 1.38 (0-3.43)</li><li>Episodic treatment arm (Arm 3): 17.69 (10.77-23.24)</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00277-en" num="0273">(a) Prophylaxis Dose and Interval Titration, and Episodic Treatment of Bleeding Episodes</p>
      <p id="p-00278-en" num="0274">Samples to measure FIX levels were drawn for all patients during the course of the study to estimate each patient's pharmacokinetics parameters to guide the appropriate dose or dosing interval adjustments toward a target trough of 1-3 IU/dl of FIX levels above baseline.</p>
      <p id="p-00279-en" num="0275">In arm 1 (fixed weekly interval): All patients in this arms initially received rFIXFc 50 IU/kg injection once weekly. Adjustments to rFIXFc dose were made based on monitoring of trough at weeks 4, 16, 26, and 39. If the pharmacokinetic values indicated the patient's trough level was 3 IU/dl above baseline or higher at the end of the week, the dose was reduced to target a trough of 1 to 3 IU/dl above baseline. If the pharmacokinetic values indicated the patient's trough level would be less than 1 IU/dl above baseline at the end of the week, the dose was increased to target a trough of 1 to 3 IU/dl above baseline. If the target range could not be achieved, a plasma sample was run to rule out the presence of inhibitors. A repeat trough level was done approximately 1 month after making any dosage adjustments and was repeated monthly until no additional adjustments were necessary. Only the dose of rFIXFc was adjusted in this treatment arm.</p>
      <p id="p-00280-en" num="0276">In arm 2 (individualized dosing interval), a dose of 100 IU per kilogram of rFIXFc was administered IV at an interval based on the patient's baseline pharmacokinetic assessment to achieve a target trough of 1 to 3 IU/dl above baseline. Monitoring took place at weeks 4, 16, 26, and 39 to ensure that this FIX tough level was maintained. Only the interval of rFIXFc was adjusted in this treatment arm.</p>
      <p id="p-00281-en" num="0277">For any patients in arm 1 or arm 2 who experienced unacceptable bleeding, with two or more spontaneous bleeds over 3 consecutive months, the dose (arm 1) or interval (arm 2) were adjusted to target a FIX trough level of 3 to 5 IU/dl above baseline. If unacceptable bleeding did not occur on rFIXFc at a target trough of 3 to 5 IU/dl above baseline, at the investigator's discretion, and after agreement with the sponsor, rFIXFc could be re-adjusted for a target trough of 1 to 3 IU/dl.</p>
      <p id="p-00282-en" num="0278">In arm 3 (episodic treatment), minor bleeding episodes were treated with 20-30 IU/kg, moderate to major bleeding episodes with 25-50 IU/kg, and major to life-threatening bleeding episodes with 50-100 IU/kg to target trough FIX levels of 20-30%, 25-50%, and 50-100%, respectively, based on the patient's pharmacokinetic profile.</p>
      <p id="p-00283-en" num="0279">(b) Efficacy Period</p>
      <p id="p-00284-en" num="0280">In arms 1 and 2, the efficacy period started with the date and time of first prophylactic dose following a completed pharmacokinetic sampling period and ended with the last dose administered (for prophylaxis or a bleeding episode) as recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) or electronic diary (eDiary). The efficacy period was interrupted for the repeat pharmacokinetic period in arm 1 (sequential pharmacokinetic subgroup) and for all surgical/rehabilitation periods (for both major and minor surgeries) in arms 1 and 2. The efficacy period continued up to the last dose (for prophylaxis or treatment of a bleeding episode) before the repeat pharmacokinetic dose or up to the last dose (for prophylaxis or treatment of a bleeding episode) before the start of a surgical/rehabilitation period, and then resumed at the next prophylactic dose following the end of the pharmacokinetic or surgical/rehabilitation period.</p>
      <p id="p-00285-en" num="0281">In arm 3, the efficacy period started 1 minute following the last pharmacokinetic sampling timepoint and ended with either the date of last contact or the date of the last entry into the eDiary, whichever was later. The efficacy period was interrupted 1 minute before the start of a surgical/rehabilitation period and restarted at 00:01 the day following the end of the surgical/rehabilitation period.</p>
      <heading id="h-00027-en" level="2">Treatment Compliance</heading>
      <p id="p-00286-en" num="0282">Compliance with treatment dosing was monitored and documented by site staff. For between-visit administration, patients self-administered rFIXFc and recorded treatment in the hand-held eDiary, which was reviewed during periodic calls to the patient and at each visit by study site staff and the clinical monitor.</p>
      <p id="p-00287-en" num="0283">Analysis of patients' compliance was based on data from the eCRF and eDiary. Analyses of compliance included patients' compliance with the prescribed prophylactic regimens. For weekly prophylaxis, analyses included percentage of nominal doses taken per patient within the 80% to 125% range. Similarly, for individualized interval prophylaxis, analysis included the percentage of doses taken per patient within Â±36 hours of the prescribed interval. Patients were considered compliant if the calculated compliance rate was at least 80%.</p>
      <heading id="h-00028-en" level="2">Analytical Method</heading>
      <p id="p-00288-en" num="0284">Plasma FIX activity was measured by the one-stage (activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]) clotting assay, which was validated for rFIXFc, BeneFIX, and human FIX in human plasma samples. FIX activity in citrated plasma samples was measured on an MDA 180 coagulation instrument using commercially available aPTT reagents, e.g., Trinity Biotech (Automated APTT [silica-based activator and phospholipid mixture]), Precision BioLogic (Cryocheckâ¢ Factor IX-depleted plasma), and normal reference plasma (Precision BioLogic) as a calibrator (LLOQ 1 IU/dl), which has a potency assigned against the World Health Organization 3rd or 4th plasma International Standard. For all three FIX proteins, the accuracy was within 95% to 104%, and the intra- and inter-assay precision was typically within 10%.</p>

      <p id="p-00290-en" num="0285">The ABR was significantly reduced for both prophylaxis arms, by 83% and 87% compared with episodic treatment based on estimates from a negative binominal regression model (3.12, 2.40, and 18.67 for arms 1, 2, and 3, respectively; P&lt;0.001 Table 8). The lower ABR in the prophylaxis arms was consistent across all demographic and disease-based subgroups in prespecified subgroup analyses (<figref>FIG. 3</figref> and Table 2). Furthermore, limiting the analysis to patients on a prior episodic regimen, the reductions in ABRs of 83% and 89% for arms 1 and 2, respectively, were consistent with the primary analysis. The proportion of patients without any bleeding episodes on prophylaxis during the study was 23.0% for arm 1 and 42.3% for arm 2. Additionally, analyses of bleeding episodes by type and location showed a low ABR in both prophylactic arms (Table 8). The median (IQR) weekly does of rFIXFc for subjects in Arm 1 in the last 3 months of the study was 40.5 IU/kg. The dosing interval for approximately half of the study population in the individualized interval prophylaxis arm (Arm 2) was â§14 days during the last 6 months on study. A summary of the median dosing for Arm 1 and Arm 2 is shown in Tables 9A and 9B.</p>

      <p id="p-00293-en" num="0286">Control of bleeding: A total of 636 bleeding episodes (Arm 1=167, Arm 2=67, Arm 3=402) in 89 subjects were treated, over 90% (90.4%) of bleeding episodes were controlled by a single injection of rFIXFc and 97.3% were controlled by &lt;2 injections. The median number of injections needed to resolve bleeding episodes was 1.0 regardless of type, compliance status, or location of bleeding episode, excluding two internal bleeding episodes in Arm 2 that required 2 injections for resolution. The median dose per injection was 46.1 IU/kg and the median total dose for the bleeding episodes was 47.0 IU/kg. For the 61 (9.6%) of bleeding episodes that required &gt;1 injection for resolution, the median interval between the first and second injection was 45 hours. Overall, subject assessment of response to treatment with rFIXFc was excellent or good for 76.4%, 77.0%, and 85.4% of injections in Arms 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Physicianâ² global assessment of subject response to their rFIXFc regimen was rated as excellent or effective for 98.8%, 99.2%, and 97.9% in Arms 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

      <p id="p-00295-en" num="0287">This efficacy was similar when examined across arms, on a per subject basis, and for subjects who treated an episode more than 8 hours after the onset of symptoms.</p>
      <p id="p-00296-en" num="0288">The dosing interval for subjects in Arm 2 increased from the initial 10 days to 53.8% of subjects achieving a median dose interval of â§14 days during the last 3 months on the study.</p>
      <p id="p-00297-en" num="0289">Perioperative management: Endpoints for Arm 4 included investigators'/surgeons' assessments of subjects' response to surgery with rFIXFc; number of injections and dose required to maintain hemostasis during the surgical period; estimated blood loss during and after surgery; and number of transfusions required for surgery. Overall, 14 major surgeries were performed in 12 subjects, including knee arthroscopy (n=4) and ankle arthroscopy (n=1), knee replacements (n=4), and others (n=5). Hemostasis was rated as excellent (13/14) or good (1/14) by the investigator/surgeon. The median estimated bleed loss was 65.5 mL (range: 0.0-300.0 mL) during surgery and 0.0 mL (range: 0.0-500 mL) postoperatively. No blood transfusions were required during surgery, but two subjects received transfusions in the postoperative period. A single injection of rFIXFc was required in 85.7% of surgeries to maintain hemostasis during surgery, at a median dose of 90.9 IU/kg per injection. On the pre-operative day, 1-2 injections were administered and 2-3 injections during the 3-day post-operative period. On the day of surgery, post-operative days 1-3, and post-operative days 4-14, the median rFIXFc consumption (summarized over all injections during referenced time period) was 146.1 IU/kg, 168.2 IU/kg, and 277.1 IU/kg, respectively. Overall, â§1 adverse event (AE) was reported for 10 (83.3%) of the 12 subjects and 3 subjects reported 6 serious AEs, all of which were resolved and judged as unrelated to rFIX treatment. Treating physicians rated the hemostatic efficacy of rFIXFc as excellent or good in 100% of surgeries.</p>
      <p id="p-00298-en" num="0290">One injection was sufficient to resolve 90.4% of bleeding episodes in Arm 1, with a median dose per injection of 46 IU/kg. Overall, 82.0% of rFIXFc injections were rated by subjects as producing an excellent or good response. The physicians' global assessment of subject response to rFIXFc was rated as excellent or effective for 98.8% of the subject visits.</p>
      <p id="p-00299-en" num="0291">The weekly rFIXFc dose for subjects in Arm 1 decreased tom the initial 50 IU/kg to a median of 45 IU/kg when averaged over the course of the study. The initial dosing interval of 10 days for subjects in Arm 2 increased over the course of the study to 12.5 days, with 12 subjects (46%) achieving a dose interval of â§14 days for the last 6 months, and 14 subjects (53.8%) for the last 3 months on the study.</p>
      <p id="p-00300-en" num="0292">Hemostasis in Arm 4 was rated as excellent or good by investigators or surgeons for 100% of 14 major surgeries performed in 12 subjects. Types of major surgeries included treatment of a dental abscess and pilonidal cyst to knee arthroplasty or knee replacement (n=6) and, amputation of a finger (n=2). A single injection of rFIXFc was sufficient to maintain hemostasis during 85.7% of major surgeries and the median average dose per injection for the 14 surgeries was 91 IU/kg.</p>

      <p id="p-00303-en" num="0294">For FIX activity pharmacokinetic analysis, the baseline (endogenous FIX activity) was pre-defined as the lowest observed FIX activity at either screening, pre-dose, post-dose, or from the patient's historical clinical records. For patients whose lowest observed FIX activity was below 1%, the baseline FIX activity was set as, zero; for patients whose lowest observed FIX activity was between 1 and 2 IU/dl, the baseline FIX activity was set at the actual observed FIX value. The residual drug was decayed following first order decay with the decay rates determined on an individual basis. The FIX activity over time profiles, corrected by baseline and residual drug, were analyzed using a user-defined and verified two-compartmental model. The user-defined code automated the calculation of additional secondary pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., Time 1% and 3%), which are not included in the secondary parameter list of the WinNonlin library mode (PHOENIXÂ® WinNonlin 6.2.1.51; Pharsight), thus eliminating the need for manual handling of data outside of the primary analysis and minimizing the risk of introducing human error.</p>
      <p id="p-00304-en" num="0295">The geometric mean terminal half-life of rFIXFc was approximately 82 hours, which is 2.4-fold (i.e., 2.43 fold) longer than that of BENEFIXÂ® (approximately 34 hours) in the 96-=hour sample (p&lt;0.001). With the 48-hour sampling, a 4.83-fold increase in half-life was observed. rFIXFc had a 2.39-fold longer mean residence time (MRT) compared with rFIX, resulting in 2.21-fold and 2.04-fold extensions of time to 1 IU/dL and 3 IU/dL above baseline, respectively (P&lt;0.001). Comparative data for rFIXFc at baseline and Week 26 was available for 21 subjects and showed no statistical difference for any PK parameters. Table 12 shows comparative PK data for rFIXFc versus rFIX from 22 subjects in the Arm 1 sequential PK subgroup, using compartmental models for the one-stage clotting, assay.</p>
      <p id="p-00305-en" num="0296">As shown in Table 12, incremental recovery was comparable between rFIX and rFIXFc (P=0.713). There was a 2.43-fold increase in the terminal FIX half-life following rFIXFc compared with rFIX when a 96-hour sampling schedule was used (82.1 vs 33.8, respectively; P&lt;0.001); see Table 12 and <figref>FIG. 4</figref>). Using the traditional 48-hour sampling schedule, which has been used to show the generally accepted half-life of rFIX (Ë18 hours), rFIXFc showed a 4.84-fold increased half-life compared to rFIX. Compared with rFIX, rFIXFc had a 2.39-fold longer mean residence time (MRT: 41.2 vs 98.6 hours; P&lt;0.001), resulting in 2.21-fold extension of time to 1 IU/dL above baseline (5.1 vs 11.2 days; P&lt;0.001). rFIXFc time to 1 IU/dL (1%) FIX and time to 3 IU/dL (3%) IU/dL were 11.2 and 5.8 days, respectively (see Table 12 and <figref>FIG. 4</figref>). Intra-individual rFIXFc PK parameters were comparable between baseline and Week 26, indicating that the PK profile of rFIXFc was stable following repeated dosing over 26 weeks.</p>

      <p id="p-00307-en" num="0297">All subjects had an initial PK evaluation to characterize the PK of rFIXFc in a representative population of subjects with Hemophilia B.</p>
      <p id="p-00308-en" num="0298">More extensive PK sampling was conducted in a subset of subjects in the weekly prophylaxis arm (Arm 1) at baseline after a single dose of BENEFIXÂ® 50 IU/kg followed by a single dose of rFIXFc 50 IU/kg. Blood samples were taken for BENEFIXÂ® over a period of 96 hours. Blood samples were then taken for rFIXFc over a period of 240 hours. PK assessment of rFIXFc was repeated at 26 weeks.</p>
      <p id="p-00309-en" num="0299">The 100-IU/kg dose was selected based on PK results from the Phase 1/2 study, which showed this dose elevated FIX levels to approximately 100% of normal (Shapiro et al 2011). In the Phase 1/2 study, with rFIXFc 100 IU/kg (n=5), the time to FIX levels 1% above baseline was approximately 11 days, and ranged from 9 to 14 days. Based on these data, Arm 2 was designed to test whether a fixed dose of 100 IU/kg could provide protection from bleeding beyond one week.</p>
      <p id="p-00310-en" num="0300">rFIXFc resulted in low median ABRs of 2.95 in the weekly prophylaxis arm, 1.38 in the individualized interval prophylaxis arm. In contrast, the episodic treatment arm had an ABR of 17.69.</p>
      <p id="p-00311-en" num="0301">In the individualized interval prophylaxis arm, the median dosing interval was 14 days during the last 6 months on study.</p>
      <p id="p-00312-en" num="0302">The terminal half-life (activity) measured by one stage clotting assay was approximately 82 hours (82.1 hours) for rFIXFc and approximately 34 hours (33.8 hours) for BENEFIXÂ®.</p>
      <p id="p-00313-en" num="0303">Overall, greater than 90% of bleeding episodes were controlled by a single injection. Hemostatic efficacy of rFIXFc for perioperative management was rated by treating physicians as excellent or good in 100% of surgeries (14 major surgeries performed on 12 subjects).</p>
      <p id="p-00314-en" num="0304">The median ABRs for the rFIXFc weekly prophylaxis and individualized interval arms were 2.95 and 1.38, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00315-en" num="0305">Greater than 90% of bleeding episodes were resolved with one injection of rFIXFc.</p>
      <p id="p-00316-en" num="0306">The terminal half-life of BENEFIXÂ® of approximately 34 hours determined in B-LONG is longer than that reported in the BENEFIXÂ® package insert (Ë18 hours) as well as a number of studies (13.7 to 19.3 hours) (Ewenstein 2002; Kisker et al. 2003; Negrier et al. 2011) that followed EMA guidelines on FIX PK assessment using a 48-hour sampling duration. However, in published PK studies in which BENEFIXÂ® was sampled up to 72 hours post dosing, a longer terminal half-life was also reported to be 21.3 to 33.4 hours (Ragni et al. 2002, Lambert et al. 2007, Chang et al. 2007, and Martinowitz et al. 2012).</p>
      <p id="p-00317-en" num="0307">To determine whether the discrepancy in terminal half-life of BENEFIXÂ® resulted from the longer PK sampling schedule of 96 hours adopted in this study, BENEFIXÂ® PK data were also analyzed using data only up to 48 hours post dose. This analysis yielded a significantly shortened terminal half-life of BENEFIXÂ® (Ë17 hours) that is consistent with previous reports using 48-hour sampling duration. A summary of the comparative data for BENEFIXÂ® is presented in Table 12B.</p>

      <p id="p-00319-en" num="0308">In the Bâ²-LONG study, a head-to head comparison was made between rFIXFc and BENEFIXÂ®, whereas in the Phase 1/2 study, the half-life of rFIXFc was compared to the historical data reported in the BENEFIXÂ® Product Insert (2009). The measure of PK improvement of rFIXFC over BENEFIXÂ® from the B-LONG study was more reliable and accurate.</p>
      <heading id="h-00030-en" level="2">Safety</heading>
      <p id="p-00320-en" num="0309">rFIXFc was well tolerated and had significantly improved PK relative to the current standard of care, rFIX. One serious AE (obstructive uropathy) was assessed as possibly related to treatment; the event resolved and the subject continued on study. Good control of bleeds and low ABRs seen with weekly to bi-weekly (every 2 weeks) dosing suggest that this therapy may substantially improve management of acute bleeds and markedly lengthen prophylactic regimens in hemophilia B, thereby potentially improving subject adherence and outcomes.</p>
      <p id="p-00321-en" num="0310">For detection of inhibitors (neutralizing antibodies), the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay to detect neutralizing antibodies was performed at screening, baseline, and each visit during study treatment to monitor for the development of an inhibitor. Following the first dose with rFIXFc, inhibitor testing in arms 1 and 2 was conducted at trough at each scheduled clinic visit, with trough defined as a point after the longest interval between scheduled doses. Inhibitor testing in arm 3 was performed following a washout of at least 72 hours (3 days). For new patients entering arm 4, inhibitor testing was performed at screening and after a total of at least 4 EDs were achieved with rFIXFc, within 4 weeks prior to scheduled surgery. Formation of an inhibitor was defined as a neutralizing antibody value â§0.6 Bethesda units (BU)/ml, confirmed in a second, separately drawn sample within 2-4 weeks. The confidence interval on the inhibitor incidence rate was evaluated using the Clopper-Pearson exact method for a binomial proportion. The acceptable inhibitor risk in clinical trials of previously treated FIX patients allows 1 of 50 patients to experience an inhibitor while on the study, with each patient requiring at least two valid tests for inhibitors over 50 to 75 EDs.</p>
      <p id="p-00322-en" num="0311">For detection of non-neutralizing antibodies (rFIXFc binding antibodies), monitoring for non-neutralizing antibodies (NNAs) that bind to rFIXFc was performed at the same time points as testing for inhibitors. A bridging assay format was employed to detect all possible classes of antibodies, with electrochemiluminescent readout on an MSD instrument. Samples were positive if the signal was above a statistically derived cut point and confirmed by inhibition with excess rFIXFc product. Positive samples were further characterized for binding to rFIX or Fc. Testing of inhibitor-positive control samples showed that this assay was approximately 100-fold more sensitive than the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay.</p>
      <p id="p-00323-en" num="0312">The study was designed to include â§50 subjects with â§50 EDs to detect the risk of inhibitors. The US Food and Drug Administration guidance for adequate demonstration of acceptable inhibitor risk in clinical trials of previously treated FIX subjects allows 1 out of 50 subjects to experience an inhibitor, with each subject requiring â§50 EDs to the study treatment. Under the assumption that the occurrence of inhibitors in a clinical study can be adequately modeled using the binomial distribution, â§50 EDs would allow for a 2-sided, 95% confidence interval for the true inhibitor incidence of (0.05%-10.65%) using the exact Clopper-Pearson method if 1 case of inhibitor formation was observed. There were no reported deaths, allergic reactions, thrombotic events, or inhibitor development in any study subjects, including 55 subjects with â§50 EDs and 94 patients with â§25 EDs. No inhibitors (neutralizing antibodies) were detected in any subject in the study. Low positive results for non-neutralizing antibodies (NNA) were found in 3 subjects, at baseline, which did not impact the PK of rFIXFc and all 3 reverted to NNA negative status during the study. One subject had borderline negative results during the study, and a borderline positive result at the end of the study. rFIXFc clearance was not impacted and the NNA were not associated with any increased bleeding frequency and/or higher consumption of rFIXFc. The incidence of AEs was similar across all treatment arms, with 45 subjects (71.4%) in Arm 1, 23 subjects (79.3%) in Arm 2, and 20 subjects (74.1%) in Arm 3 reporting â§1 AE. The majority of the AEs were judged by the Investigator as unrelated or unlikely related to treatment. AEs judged as possibly related or related to treatment were reported in 10 (8.4%) of the 119 subjects in Arms 1, 2, and 3 combined. No discernable trends were detected for coagulation activation markers (F1+2, D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complex) in the sequential PK subgroup, nor for total IgG and subclass levels in any of the Arms.</p>
      <p id="p-00324-en" num="0313">Long-lasting rFIXFc was efficacious in maintaining perioperative hemostasis in subjects with hemophilia B. The high rating of perioperative hemostasis by surgeons and investigators for all major surgeries conducted suggests that blood loss was comparable to that expected for a subject without hemophilia.</p>
      <p id="p-00325-en" num="0314">The results disclosed herein show that rFIXFc provided effective control of acute bleeding episodes and demonstrated efficacious prophylaxis, for both weekly and individualized interval prophylaxis of longer interval duration (e.g., every 1-2 weeks) and/or higher trough levels. Notably, approximately 50% of subjects in the individualized prophylaxis cohort (Arm 2) showed dosing intervals of â§2 weeks. Compared with rFIX, rFIXFc showed a substantially improved PK profile, which allowed longer dosing intervals for prophylactic regimens that can be less burdensome to subjects. The PK profile of rFIXFc was stable over time. These results show that rFIXFc is a first in its class long-lasting recombinant factor IX therapy, which may offer a treatment shift toward less frequent injections and still provide prolonged protection from bleeding, thereby promoting increased adherence to prophylaxis and improved outcomes in hemophilia B subjects.</p>
      <p id="p-00326-en" num="0315">To ensure consistency of laboratory analyses, one central laboratory was used for each type of assay. Analyses of clinical safety samples and central sample management were performed at LabCorp (Cranford, N.J., USA). FIX activity and inhibitor assays were conducted at LabCorp (Englewood, Colo., USA). Genotyping of samples was done at Hemostasis Lab, Puget Sound Blood Center (Seattle, Wash., USA). ICON Development Solutions (Whitesboro, N.Y., USA) analyzed FIX antigen and non-neutralizing antibody (NNA) samples, and Chimera Biotech GmbH (Dortmund, Germany) analyzed rFIXFc concentration samples.</p>

      <p id="p-00331-en" num="0324">Control of bleeding: Over 90% (90.4%) of bleeding episodes were controlled by a single injection of rFIXFc.</p>
      <p id="p-00332-en" num="0325">Perioperative management: Treating physicians rated the hemostatic efficacy of rFIXFc as excellent or good in 100% of surgeries.</p>
      <p id="p-00333-en" num="0326">Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in 10 of 119 (8.4%) subjects treated with routine prophylaxis or episodic (on-demand) therapy. Adverse drug reactions are considered adverse events assessed by the investigator as related or possibly related to treatment with rFIXFc. Adverse drug reactions are summarized in Tables 14A and 14B.</p>
      <p id="p-00334-en" num="0327">The incidence of adverse events was similar across all treatment arms, with at least ore adverse event reported in 45 patients (71.4%) in arm 1, 23 patients (79.3%) in arm 2, and 20 patients (74.1%) in arm 3. The majority were judged by investigators as unrelated or unlikely related to treatment. Adverse events judged as related or possibly related to treatment were reported in 10 (8.4%) of the 119 patients in arms 1, 2, and 3 combined. One serious adverse event judged as possibly related to treatment by the investigator was a case of an obstructive clot in the urinary collecting system that resolved with hydration and the patient continued the study treatment. There were no reports of hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, or thrombotic events, and there were no deaths, in the study. There were no clinically meaningful changes in coagulation activation markers (F1+2, D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complex) or for total IgG and subclass levels.</p>
      <p id="p-00335-en" num="0328">No subject was withdrawn from study due to an adverse drug reaction. In the study, no inhibitors were detected and no events of anaphylaxis were reported.</p>
      <p id="p-00336-en" num="0329">rFIXFc was well-tolerated, with no evidence of neoantigenicity, and adverse events were consistent with those expected in a hemophilia population. Notably, the high rate of compliance in this study (96.6%) and corresponding high study completion rate (93.5%) further support the tolerability of rFIXFc. The risk of inhibitors has been reported to be up to 3% in the naÃ¯ve hemophilia B population. See Tandra A, and Shapiro AD (2010) in Lee Calif., Berntorp E, Hoots WK, eds. Textbook of hemophilia, 2nd ed. Hoboken, N.J.: Wiley-Blackwell; and DiMichele D. (2007) <i>Br J Haematol </i>138:305-15. Patients generally develop inhibitors within the first 50 EDs to exogenous FIX replacement therapy (see Dimichele D. (2002) <i>Haemophilia </i>8:280-287), which supported the end of study criteria. B-LONG included a total of 5144 EDs (117.1 patient-years of exposure), with 55 patients having â§50 EDs, and no inhibitors were detected in any patients. In this study, low-titer NNAs were observed, in a small proportion of patients (3%) at screening and baseline, and became negative in three of four cases during rFIXFc treatment. The low-titer NNAs observed in this study had no discernible effect on rFIXFc pharmacokinetics or bleeding rates.</p>

      <heading id="h-00033-en" level="1">The Clinical Implications of Population Pharmacokinetics of rFIXFc in Routine Prophylaxis, Control of Bleeding and Perioperative Management for Hemophilia B Subjects</heading>
      <p id="p-00339-en" num="0330">BACKGROUND: Clinical dosing of factor IX (FIX) in treatment of hemophilia B is well established based on empirical practice and clinical outcomes. Since pharmacokinetics (PK) of FIX activity is the surrogate efficacy marker, we utilized population PK (popPK) modeling and simulation to evaluate dosing regimens of long-acting recombinant FIX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc). The PK of rFIXFc, from 135 single-dose and 21 repeat-dose profiles in subjects â§12 years old (body weight (BW): 45-186.7 kg), was best described by a 3-compartmental model, which showed modest inter-individual variability (IIV) of 17.7% for clearance (CL) and 21.7% for volume of central compartment (V1). The proportional residue error of 10.6% approximates the variability of the one-stage clotting assay for FIX activity. The only covariate that showed a weak association with rFIXFc PK is BW, which accounted for Ë3% of IIV for CL and V1, suggesting that BW-independent flat dosing of rFIXFc may be feasible for treating adult hemophilia B subjects.</p>
      <p id="p-00340-en" num="0331">AIMS: To simulate the BW-based and flat dosing regimens for routine prophylaxis, control of bleeding and perioperative management in the hemophilia B population.</p>
      <p id="p-00341-en" num="0332">METHOD: The validated 3-compartmental popPK model, including inter-occasion variability and BW as the covariate on CL and V1, was used for dosing simulations. For BW-based dosing regimen, PK profiles were simulated for 1000 subjects with BW distribution representative of the phase 3 study. BW distribution was simulated using a power function Z=BWâ0.5. The generated BW (1000 values) distribution has a median of 74.9 kg and a range of 38.9 to 172.6 kg, which is similar to our studies (median, 73.3 kg; min and max, 45 and 186.7 kg). For fixed dosing regimen, three populations (n=1000 each) were stratified based on low (10th percentile), typical (10th-90th percentile) and high (90th percentile) BW. Variability of exposure parameters, percentage of population maintaining target Cmax and trough, and deviations of median exposure parameters in extreme BW groups were compared with BW-based and flat dosing regimens. To simulate steady-state in prophylaxis regimen, six doses were applied for all dosing regimens (once weekly, every 10 days, or every 14 days), with each dosing interval assigned as one occasion. To simulate the PK profile following an episodic treatment, a single dose was applied.</p>
      <p id="p-00342-en" num="0333">RESULT: Consistent with the observations from the phase 3 study, popPK simulation of 50 IU/kg once weekly or 100 IU/kg every 10-14 days predicted peak FIX activity within the physiologic range (Cmax &lt;150%) and trough â§1% in majority of the population. All simulated regimens predicted that the majority of the population will maintain trough activity at or above 1% (Table 15).</p>

      <p id="p-00346-en" num="0335">Furthermore, BW-based and flat dosing resulted in comparable PK profiles with comparable exposure parameters, e.g., 50 IU/kg and 4000 IU once weekly predicted a median (5th, 95th percentile) Cmax of 52.6 (32.1, 89.3) IU/dL and 56.1 (36.2, 90.9) IU/dL, respectively. Both dosing regimens predicted that &gt;95% of the population maintains Cmax &lt;150% and trough â§1% (<figref>FIG. 14</figref>). However, BW-based and flat dosing showed differential effects on the exposure parameters in extreme (â¦10th or â§90th percentile) BW populations. This suggests that BW-independent flat dosing may be feasible for patients 12 years and older.</p>
      <p id="p-00347-en" num="0336">The popPK model was used to simulate dosing regimens for episodic treatment. The model predicts that for the control of bleeding episodes, a single dose of 50 or 100 IU/kg of rFIXFc is sufficient to maintain the plasma FIX peak activity levels at 40 to 80 IU/dL (Table 17) as recommended by the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) guidelines.</p>

      <p id="p-00349-en" num="0337">Analysis of 12 major surgeries and 2 minor surgeries found that the FIX activities measured during the perioperative period were largely consistent with the prediction by popPK based on subjects' pre-surgery baseline PK, indicating no substantial factor consumption in these surgeries. A representative plot of observed and predicted perioperative FIX activity is shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>. Simulated and observed FIX activities were compared within the first 21 days after the first rFIXFc surgical dose (n=14; 12 major surgeries, 2 minor surgeries). There was good correlation between the observed FIX activity data and that predicted by the PK model (relative prediction error [95% CI], 0.332% [â2.08%, 1.42%]).</p>
      <p id="p-00350-en" num="0338">CONCLUSION: PopPK provides a robust and effective means to evaluate potential dosing regimens. The predictions by popPK simulation for rFIXFc corroborate the results from the phase 3 study. The simulations of BW-based and flat dosing of rFIXFc achieved similar PK profiles. Considering the wide therapeutic range for factor replacement therapy, flat dosing of rFIXFc and rFIX products may be a potentially viable approach in adult hemophilia B subjects that warrants further clinical investigation. Furthermore, using a population PK model, it is feasible to develop a general dosing guidance to achieve target FIX levels recommended for perioperative management in patients with haemophilia B.</p>

      <p id="p-00351-en" num="0339">BACKGROUND: Population pharmacokinetic (PK) models are developed to understand the sources of variability in dose requirements (covariates) and to help individualize dosing regimens if necessary. Dosing histories and subject-specific data are used to gain an understanding of drug disposition in order to discern specific demographic and/or clinical factors that may be predictors of PK parameters. By characterizing the population PK (popPK) of long-acting FIX-Fc (rFIXFc) in subjects with severe hemophilia B (â¦2 IU/dL plasma FIX activity), a model of estimated population PK parameters of rFIXFc can be established. This model may assist physicians who wish to tailor dosing for individual subjects with sparse PK samples.</p>
      <p id="p-00352-en" num="0340">METHODS: Male subjects with severe hemophilia B were included from a phase 1/2a study (n=12) and the phase 3 study (B-LONG, n=123) described above. The subjects ranged in age from 12 to 76 years and in body weight from 45 to 186 kg. The modeling dataset included 135 baseline PK profiles at Week 1, as well as 21 repeat PK profiles at Week 26, with a total of 1400 measured FIX activity records. The final population PK model was validated using 1027 trough/peak FIX activity records from 119 subjects.</p>
      <p id="p-00353-en" num="0341">In the popPK analysis, plasma FIX activity was measured by the one-stage (activated partial thromboplastin time) clotting assay. Corrected FIX activity was calculated using the formula:</p>
      <p id="p-00354-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]Corrected FIX activity=Measured FIX activityâBaselineâResidual decay.[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00355-en" num="0342">Baseline FIX activity was defined as the lowest level of activity (LLACT) recorded at screening, predose, postdose, or from historical clinical records. When the baseline is equal to 0, the LLACT is less than 1% (lower limit of quantification). When the baseline FIX activity is equal to LLACT, LLACT is greater than or equal to 1% and less than or equal to 2%.</p>
      <p id="p-00356-en" num="0343">Prestudy residual decay was performed using terminal half-life obtained from a noncompartmental analysis of the individual data by the following formula:</p>

      <p id="p-00358-en" num="0344">For the popPK model development, NONMEM VII version 1.0 (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, Md.) was used. The modeling and qualification steps are presented below in Table 20.</p>

      <p id="p-00363-en" num="0347">RESULTS: The rFIXFc disposition was best described by a three-compartment base model (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>). The model was further improved by including intra-subject random changes at different occasions (i.e., inter-occasion variability, IOV) for CL and V1 (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>). IOV was smaller than inter-individual variability (IIV), indicating that individual PK was more accurate than the mean popPK for individual PK prediction.</p>
      <p id="p-00364-en" num="0348">Body weight was found to be a significant covariate for rFIXFc disposition (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>), although the impact of BW was limited. For example, the BW exponent on CL and V1 was 0.436 and 0.396, respectively, and inclusion of BW reduced inter-individual variability (IIV) for both CL and V1 only by 3.4% and 2.5%, respectively. None of the other covariates assessed, including age, race, blood type or genotype, were significant covariates in this model.</p>

Goodness-of-fit plots show that the predicted popPK data generated by the model closely mimic the observed FIX activity data (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00368-en" num="0351">The results of the popPK model were validated using the observed FIX activity data. The median and 80% interval for observed and predicted FIX activity time profiles nearly overlapped, indicating that the final model was able to reproduce both the central tendency and variability of the observed FIX activity data on the time scale (<figref>FIG. 9</figref>). The strong correlation between observed and predicted FIX activities in the trough/peak dataset suggested that the final popPK model is predictive (<figref>FIG. 10</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00369-en" num="0352">Finally, the overall relative prediction error was â3.23% with a 95% confidence interval of â5.27% to â1.23%. Post hoc estimates from this popPK analysis were very similar to the results from the conventional PK analysis shown below in Table 22.</p>

      <p id="p-00371-en" num="0353">CONCLUSIONS: The three-compartment popPK model predicted disposition of rFIXFc with modest inter-individual variability (IIV). Individual PK parameters derived from the three-compartment popPK model were similar to those derived from the two-compartment conventional PK analysis, indicating a limited 3rd compartment contribution. For a typical 73 kg subject, the popPK model predicted a clearance of 2.39 dL/h; volume of central compartment of 71.4 dL; and volume of distribution at steady state of 198 dL. The only significant covariate assessed in the popPK model was BW, although its impact on rFIXFc PK variability was limited.</p>
      <p id="p-00372-en" num="0354">The final popPK model can be used to simulate dosing regimens and intervals for routine prophylaxis, control and prevention of bleeding episodes, and peri-operative management. This model may assist physicians who wish to tailor dosing for individual subjects with sparse PK samples.</p>

      <p id="p-00373-en" num="0355">A phase 3, open-label, multicenter, paediatric study to evaluate the safety, PK, and efficacy of rFIXFc for the control and prevention of bleeding in previously treated children (&lt;12 years of age) with severe hemophilia B (endogenous FIX activity â¦2 IU/dL [2%]) is described.</p>
      <p id="p-00374-en" num="0356">The enrolment is approximately 26 children with hemophilia B. Eligibility criteea for this pediatric previously treated subject (PTP) study requires the children to have had â§50 documented prior exposure days (EDs) to FIX products, weigh â§13 kg at the time of consent, and have no current or history of inhibitors to FIX products. The treatment regimen is for prophylaxis (see study design shown in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>). PK analysis of FIX and rFIXFc will be performed in participants prior to initiation of prophylactic treatment with rFIXFc.</p>
      <p id="p-00375-en" num="0357">Primary and secondary outcome measures will include frequency of inhibitor development (for the primary outcome measures) and number of annualized bleeding episodes and/or response to treatment with rFIXFc for bleeding episodes (for the secondary outcome measures).</p>
      <p id="p-00376-en" num="0358">The safety and efficacy of rFIXFc in previously untreated subjects (PUPs), defined by the European Medicines Agency as subjects with no prior exposure to any factor products will also be assessed. The results of the paediatric PTP and PUP studies will provide further insight into the clinical safety and hemostatic parameters of rFIXFc for treating, hemophilia in children.</p>
      <p id="p-00377-en" num="0359">Interim Analysis</p>
      <p id="p-00378-en" num="0360">Prophylaxis with factor IX (FIX) is the optimal treatment for patients with hemophilia B; however, due to the short half-life of currently available FIX products, frequent injections may be required to prevent bleeding episodes. To prolong half-life and reduce injection frequency, a long-lasting recombinant FIX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) consisting of one rFIX molecule covalently linked to the Fc domain of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) was developed. In a phase 3 study in adults and adolescents, rFIXFc had a 2.43-fold increase in half-life and 50% reduction in clearance (CL) compared with FIX (BeneFIXÂ®) (J Thromb Haemost. 2013; 11[2]:241). The Kids B-LONG study (NCT01440946) was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy of rFIXFc prophylaxis in previously treated pediatric subjects with hemophilia B. The objective of this planned interim analysis was to determine the PK parameters of rFIXFc in subjects enrolled in Kids B-LONG and compare these parameters to their pre-study FIX PK parameters.</p>
      <p id="p-00379-en" num="0361">Methods: This multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study is currently enrolling previously treated subjects aged &lt;12 years with severe hemophilia B (&lt;2 IU/dL endogenous FIX), at least 50 exposure days (EDs) to FIX products, and no inhibitors to FIX. Subjects were stratified into two age cohorts (&lt;6 and 6 to &lt;12 years of age). A weekly prophylactic regimen of 50-60 IU/kg of rFIXFc was administered to all subjects, with subsequent dose and interval adjustments based upon PK data and bleeding frequency. Subjects will continue treatment until they achieve 50 EDs. The primary endpoint is the incidence of inhibitor formation. A sequential PK analysis was performed to compare the PK parameters of rFIXFc with that of pre-study FIX products. PK sampling of pre-study FIX occurs at baseline prior to first dose of FIX (50 IU/kg) and at 5 additional time points through 48 hours. PK sampling of rFIXFc occurs prior to first dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc and at 7 additional time points through 168 hours following the first dose; a washout period of 96 hours is required before the first dose of both pre-study FIX and rFIXFc. Plasma FIX activity is measured using the one-stage clotting assay calibrated against a commercially available FIX plasma standard and the FIX activity-over-time profiles are analyzed by non-compartmental analysis (NCA) using the PK data analysis software PHOENIXâ¢ WinNonlin 6.2.1.51. A data cut-off date of 23 Apr. 2013 was used to report PK data in this, interim analysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00380-en" num="0362">Results: At the time of this interim analysis, 24 subjects were enrolled and had received at least one dose of pre-study FIX and/or rFIXFc. Of 18 subjects with evaluable PK profiles, 15 had complete PK profiles for both pre-study FIX (BENEFIXÂ®, HAEMOSOLVEXÂ®, or ALPHANINEÂ®) and rFIXFc. A comparison of PK parameters for rFIXFc versus FIX for both age cohorts is presented in Table 23. rFIXFc had a more than 3-fold prolongation in half-life and a more than 60% reduction in CL compared to the FIX products.</p>

      <p id="p-00382-en" num="0363">Conclusion: In comparison to currently available FIX products, rFIXFc had a prolonged half-life and reduced CL in pediat subjects, which was similar to previous observations in adults and adolescents. The final analysis of the Kids B-LONG study will provide further PK information and evaluate the safety and efficacy of rFIXFc in children.</p>

      <heading id="h-00040-en" level="1">Use of the Population Pharmacokinetic Model of rFIXFc to Simulate or Estimate Individualized and Median Patient Treatment Information</heading>
      <p id="p-00383-en" num="0364">As is discussed in Examples 5 and 6, a model of estimated population PK parameters of rFIXFc has been established that can assist physicians and other healthcare practitioners who wish to tailor dosing for individual subjects with e.g., sparse PK samples. Alternatively, the model can be used to determine dosing based on PK data for the whole population (median PK).</p>
      <p id="p-00384-en" num="0365">Thus, individualized patient treatment, e.g. pharmacokinetics (Ph) and dosing regimens, can be selected using Bayesian estimation (or similar machine learning algorithm) based on the population pharmacokinetic (popPK) model described in Example 6, above (e.g., Table 21). In this way, one can determine alternative prophylactic dosing regimens and optimized dosing regimens for peri-operative management that have not previously been studied in the B-LONG trials. Alternatively, the selected dosing regimen is based on population PK (median PK) rather than making an individualized selection.</p>
      <p id="p-00385-en" num="0366">In some embodiments, the rFIXFc popPK model of Example 6 (e.g., Table 21) is used without the Bayesian or similar machine learning algorithm.</p>
      <p id="p-00386-en" num="0367">In some embodiments of this aspect of the invention, the method is carried out on a computer-based system, e.g., a server, a desk top computer, a lap top computer, a tablet, a hand held device, or a smart phone. In some embodiments, the computer-based system is a computer application. The computer-based system includes a storage medium for the rFIXFc popPK model discussed in Example 6, e.g., the parameters of Table 21. In some embodiments, the storage medium can also contain a Bayesian estimating program, e.g., NONMEM or Phoenix NLME. E.g., Example 6; Kiang et al., <i>Clin. Pharmacokinet </i>51:515-525 (2012).</p>
      <p id="p-00387-en" num="0368">In some embodiments, the system comprises two or more computer-based systems. In some embodiments, the user can input information into a first computer-Lased system that communicates with a second computer-based system, and the second computer-based system carries out calculations and communicates output information to the first computer-based system. This output information can include recommendations about individualized or non-individualized dosing regimens.</p>
      <p id="p-00388-en" num="0369">In some embodiments, the user inputs information into the system and the system calculates and outputs one or more PK or dosing regimens. In some embodiments, the system uses the received information to calculate and output individualized or median PK information. In some embodiments, the system calculates individualized dosing or interval information.</p>
      <p id="p-00389-en" num="0370">Information that can be input by a user and received by the system includes patient information and desired treatment outcome information. Based on the type and value of the received information, the computer-based system Calculates output information based on the rFIXFc popPK model, and optional machine learning algorithm on the storage medium.</p>
      <p id="p-00390-en" num="0371">Patient information includes, e.g., age, body weight, diagnostic (baseline) FIX level, PK determinations, time of PK sampling, dosing history if PK samples were taken from multiple doses, actual dose, FIX activity level, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00391-en" num="0372">Desired treatment outcome information includes desired PK or desired regimen outcome, e.g., desired rise in plasma FIX activity level following dose, desired dosing interval, and desired dose.</p>
      <p id="p-00392-en" num="0373">Based on the information that was input and received by the system, the system can output various information, e.g., PK curve, PK parameter such as incremental recovery (Cmax/dose), mean residence time, terminal t1/2, clearance, Vss, AUC/dose, doses and associated troughs, and intervals and associated troughs.</p>
      <p id="p-00393-en" num="0374">For example, for assessing individualized patient FK, the system can recommend that the user input 2-3 optimized PK sampling time points. In this case, system output can include PK curve and one or more selected PK parameters, e.g., incremental recovery (Cmax/Dose), mean residence time, terminal t1/2, clearance, Vss, AUC, and time to 1 or X %, etc. E.g., <figref>FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00394-en" num="0375">As additional examples, to select an individualized dosing regimen using the output individual PK parameters discussed in, the preceding paragraph, (i) the dose selected for acute treatment can be based on user input of the desired rise in plasma FIX activity level following the dose, (ii) the dose selected for prophylaxis can be based on user input of the desired dosing interval, or (iii) the selected interval for prophylaxis can be based on user input for the desired dose. In the first case, the system can output the dose (IU) based in the patient's incremental recovery. E.g, <figref>FIG. 16</figref>. In the second case, system output can be a table of doses and associated troughs, e.g., x IU/kg, 1% trough, y IU/kg, 2% trough, etc. e.g., <figref>FIG. 17</figref>, top. In the third case, system output can be a table of intervals and associated troughs, e.g., x days, 1% trough, y IU/kg, 2% trough, etc., E.g., <figref>FIG. 17</figref>, bottom.</p>
      <p id="p-00395-en" num="0376">The user may wish to use the system without inputting any individualized PK data. In this case, the dosing output would be based on the population median rather than being individualized for the particular patient. E.g., <figref>FIG. 18</figref>. In this way, the user inputs, e.g., body weight and age, and (i) the desired rise in plasma FIX activity level following the dose, (ii) the desired dose interval for prophylaxis, or (iii) the desired dose for prophylaxis. In the first case, the system can output the dose. In the second case, the system can output the dose and associated trough, e.g., Table 16. In the third case, the system can output the interval and associated trough, e.g., Table 16.</p>
      <p id="p-00396-en" num="0377">Age can be input to determine if the system is suitable for the patient because the current version of the popPK model was built for patients 12 years and older.</p>
      <p id="p-00397-en" num="0378">In some embodiments, the system is compliant with patient privacy laws. In some embodiments, the system is encrypted, e.g., with SSL. In some embodiments, input patient information is made anonymous.</p>
      <p id="p-00398-en" num="0379">In some embodiments, the system includes a user help function.</p>
      <p id="p-00399-en" num="0380">The user can be, e.g., a physician, a nurse, or another healthcare practitioner.</p>
      <p id="p-00400-en" num="0381">In some embodiments, the method further includes selecting a dosing regimen based on the system's output information and administering rFIXFc to the patient according to the selected regimen.</p>

      <heading id="h-00042-en" level="1">Association of Bleeding Tendency with Time under Target FIX Activity Levels in Severe Hemophilia B Patients Treated with rFIXFc</heading>
      <p id="p-00401-en" num="0382">The goal of prophylactic treatment with coagulation factor replacement in hemophilia patients has been to convert severe hemophilia, defined as &lt;1% endogenous factor activity levels, to moderate (1% to 5%) and mild (5 to 40%) disease. Increased time spent under 1% FVIII activity may be associated with an increase in total bleeding episodes and hemarthroses in patients with severe hemophilia A. No studies to date have documented this association for FIX activity in patients with severe hemophilia B. We report here the analysis of bleeding tendency in relation to FIX activity from the recently completed phase 3, B-LONG study. The B-LONG study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy of a recombinant FIX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) in severe hemophilia B patients. Briefly, the B-LONG study had 4 treatment arms: weekly prophylaxis, tailored prophylaxis, episodic treatment, and perioperative management. The corresponding median annualized bleeding rates for the first 3 treatment arms were 2.95, 1.38, and 17.69, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00402-en" num="0383">Methods: A 3-compartmental population PK model of rFIXFc was developed based on activity-time profiles in 12 subjects from a Phase 1/2a study and 123 subjects (&gt;12 years) from B-LONG, collected over &lt;52 weeks of treatment. Individual post-hoc PK parameters were then derived to construct continuous FIX activity-time profiles for each dose administered over the course of the study for subjects in B-LONG. The cumulative time under target 1%, 3%, and 5% FIX level for each individual on study was calculated and normalized to obtain annualized time under the respective target FIX level. Negative binomial regression models were used to evaluate associations between the number of bleeding events (overall, spontaneous, traumatic, and joint) and annualized time (days) under 1%, 3%, and 5% of FIX activity for all subjects in B-LONG. Models were adjusted for age, body mass index, baseline HIV and HCV status, FIX genotype, number of bleeding episodes in the 12 months prior to study entry, and each subject's time on study.</p>
      <p id="p-00403-en" num="0384">Results: The multivariable negative binomial regression analysis estimated that overall bleeding events increased with increased time spent under 1% of FIX activity (p&lt;0.001). The association, however, is largely driven by subjects on episodic treatment. The median annualized time under 1% for subjects on episodic treatment was 171 days, in contrast to the median of 0 days for subjects on either weekly prophylaxis, or tailored prophylaxis, respectively, as the tailored PK-driven dosing regimens were designed to maintain a target trough above 1%. The association is consistent with the distribution of bleeding events, most of which occurred at predicted FIX activity levels under 1% in subjects on episodic treatment. Since the distribution of predicted FIX trough levels in subjects on prophylaxis were largely in the range of 1% to 5%, the analysis was repeated for cumulative time under 3% and 5%. Both analyses found statistically significant increases in predicted bleeding events as time spent below the respective FIX activity levels increased (<figref>FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>). The significant association was also observed for spontaneous, traumatic, or joint bleeds analyzed separately for all 3 target FIX activity levels. When comparing across thresholds (1% vs. 3% vs. 5%), the predicted bleeding rate was significantly reduced and the predicted probability of being bleed-free improved as the trough increased. Additionally, the odds of having joint bleeds increased significantly with increasing time spent under the respective target trough (1%, 3%, or 5%).</p>
      <p id="p-00404-en" num="0385">Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate a correlation between increased time spent under a target therapeutic FIX activity level (1%, 3% or 5%) and increased bleeding tendency, as well as a reduced probability of being bleed-free, in adolescent and adult subjects treated with rFIXFc. Based on population PK simulations for FIX activity, these findings confirm the importance of a minimum therapeutic threshold of 1% and provide additional support for establishing prophylactic dosing regimens for patients with severe hemophilia B.</p>

      <p id="p-00405-en" num="0386">Abstract: To elucidate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc) in patients with hemophilia B and identify covariates that affect rFIXFc disposition, population PK analysis using NONMEMÂ® (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, Md.) was performed with clinical data from two completed trials in previously treated patients with severe to moderate hemophilia B. Twelve patients from a phase 1/2a study and 123 patients from a registrational phase 3 study were included in this population PK analysis. A three-compartmental model was found to best describe the PK of rFIXFc. For a typical 73-kg patient, population predicted clearance (CL), volume of central compartment (V1), and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) were 2.39 dL/h, 71.4 dL and 198 dL, respectively. Because of repeat PK profiles at week 26 for patients in a subgroup, inclusion of inter-occasion variability (IOV) on CL and V1 were evaluated and significantly improved the model. The magnitude of IOV on CL and V1 were both low to moderate (&lt;20%) and less than the corresponding inter-individual variability. Body weight (BW) was found to be the only significant covariate for rFIXFc disposition. However, the impact of BW was limited, as the BW power exponent on CL and V1 were 0.436 and 0.396, respectively. This is the first population PK analysis that systematically characterized the PK of long-acting rFIXFc in patients with hemophilia B. The population PK model for rFIXFc can potentially be utilized to evaluate and optimize dosing regimens for the treatment of patients with hemophilia B.</p>
      <p id="p-00406-en" num="0387">Hemophilia B is a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of coagulation factor IX (FIX). The disease is caused by a mutation on the X chromosome and affects approximately 1 in 30,000 males [1, 2]. Hemophilia B results in abnormal clot formation, causing prolonged and abnormal bleeding, including bleeding into joints, soft tissue, muscle and body cavities. Bleeding episodes may be associated with trauma or occur in the absence of trauma (spontaneous bleeding). If not treated appropriately, bleeding can be life-threatening or result in significant morbidity [2, 3]. Current mainstay of the treatment is the FIX replacement therapy.</p>
      <p id="p-00407-en" num="0388">rFIXFc (recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein) is a recombinant protein consisting of a single molecule of FIX covalently fused to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) with no intervening sequence. The Fc domain is responsible for the long circulating half-life of IgG1 through interaction with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) that is expressed in many different cell types [4, 5]. rFIXFc was therefore designed as a long-acting version of recombinant FIX, e.g., BeneFIXÂ® (Pfizer Inc, New York, N.Y.) [6, 7]. rFIXFc has the potential to fulfill an unmet medical need by providing a long-acting therapy for control and prevention of bleeding episodes, routine prophylaxis and perioperative management in patients with hemophilia B. Two clinical trials with rFIXFc have been completed in previously treated patients with severe to moderate hemophilia B (with â¦2 IU/dL [%] endogenous FIX): one single dose phase 1/2a study in 14 patients (12 of them who received doses â§12.5 IU/kg had PK assessment) [6], and one registrational phase 3 study in 123 patients. rFIXFc was shown to be well tolerated and efficacious in the treatment of bleeding, routine prophylaxis and perioperative management.</p>
      <p id="p-00408-en" num="0389">The purpose of this analysis is to characterize the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of rFIXFc in patients with hemophilia B and to identify demographic and clinical factors that are potential determinants of rFIXFc PK variability. The population PK model of rFIXFc can be used to evaluate and guide dosing regimens of rFIXFc in the treatment of patients with hemophilia B.</p>
      <p id="p-00409-en" num="0390">Methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00410-en" num="0391">Clinical Studies: FIX activity data were obtained from two completed clinical trials in previously treated patients with severe to moderate hemophilia B. Twelve evaluable patients from the phase 1/2a study and 123 patients, from the phase 3 study (B-LONG) who had measurable FIX activities were included in this population PK analysis. The clinical studies are summarized in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The trials were registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00716716 (phase 1/2a) and NCT01027364 (phase 3) [8]. All subjects were patients with severe to moderate hemophilia B previously treated with FIX products, from 12.1 to 76.8 years of age. All patients, or patient guardians, gave informed written consent. The studies were conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.</p>
      <p id="p-00411-en" num="0392">Pharmacokinetic Sampling and Bioanalytical Methods: In the phase 1/2a study, 12 patients underwent rFIXFc PK sampling up to 14 days. In the phase 3 study, PK samples were collected for rFIXFc in all patients according to the schedule in Table 24. PK profiles of rFIXFc were assessed at week 1 (baseline) for all patients and at week 26 for the Arm 1 sequential PK subgroup. For patients on prophylaxis in Arms 1 and 2, additional trough and peak samples were collected at clinical visits throughout the study.</p>

      <p id="p-00413-en" num="0393">The population PK modeling was performed using plasma FIX activity data as measured by the one-stage activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) clotting assay using commercially available aPTT reagents (Trinity Biotech) and normal reference plasma (Precision BioLogic). Lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 1 IU/dL (%). The accuracy of the assay was within 95-104%, and the intra- and inter-assay precision was approximately 10%.</p>
      <p id="p-00414-en" num="0394">Data Handling: A total of 11 data post-infusion were below the limit of quantification (BLQ, below LLOQ of 1%). Since those post-infusion BLQ values represent &lt;0.5% of the observations, they were excluded from the analysis as the first step of data handling [9-11].</p>
      <p id="p-00415-en" num="0395">The one-stage clotting assay does not distinguish FIX activities resulting from endogenous baseline, residual activity from incomplete washout of the pre-study FIX product or the input study drug rFIXFc. Therefore, the baseline and residual activity corrections were applied to the observed FIX activity data (Eq. 1 and 2). The corrected FIX activities were recorded as the dependent variable (DV) in the population PK dataset. Similar baseline and residual activity corrections were reported previously for the PK analyses of other FIX products [12-15].</p>

      <p id="p-00418-en" num="0396">The endogenous baseline FIX activity level is dictated by the defective FIX genotype and thus stable in each individual subject, yet could be overestimated in patients receiving FIX replacement therapy who underwent incomplete washout. Therefore the baseline FIX activity was defined as the lowest FIX activity observed throughout the study, including all the screening, pre-dose and post-dose records. For patients whose lowest observed FIX activity was &lt;1% (LLOQ), the baseline FIX activity was set at 0; for patients whose lowest observed FIX activity was between 1-2%, the baseline FIX activity was set at the lowest observed FIX activity. The study enrollment is limited to subjects with baseline FIX activity â¦2%.</p>
      <p id="p-00419-en" num="0397">Residual activity was defined as pre-dose minus baseline FIX activity. For subjects in the Arm 1 sequential PK subgroup who underwent PK assessment with the comparator FIX product (BeneFIX) prior to the rFIXFc PK assessment, the residual activity was decayed using the individual subject's BeneFIX terminal first-order decay rate estimated by the non-compartmental analysis it Phoenixâ¢ WinNonlin 6.2 (Pharsight, Sunnyvale, Calif.). For all other subjects who did not have a BeneFIX PK assessment, the residual activity was decayed from the rFIXFc PK profiles using the average BeneFIX terminal first-order decay rate from the Arm 1 sequential PK subgroup.</p>
      <p id="p-00420-en" num="0398">In summary, for each individual subject, the baseline activity was first subtracted from observed FIX activities and then residual activity, if any, was decayed from baseline-corrected FIX activities to obtain the corrected FIX activities.</p>

      <p id="p-00425-en" num="0401">The modeling strategy was a two-step approach. The first step was to build the population PK model using the modeling dataset and the second step was to validate the model with goodness-of-fit plots, bootstrapping, visual prediction check (VPC) and the trough/peak validation dataset [16]. As a comparison, the rFIXFc model using the fall dataset, which combined the modeling and validation dataset, was also developed.</p>
      <p id="p-00426-en" num="0402">Population PK Modeling: NONMEMÂ® 7 version 1.0 (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, Md.) with an Intel Fortran compiler (version 12) was used for the population PK model development. Statistical program R (version 2.15.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to compile NONMEM datasets and generate graphics. Perl Speaks NONMEM (PsN, version 3.5.3) [17] was used to conduct bootstrapping. PsN and)(pose 4 [18] were used to perform VPC.</p>
      <p id="p-00427-en" num="0403">A first order conditional estimation with interaction method (FOCEI) was used to estimate population PK parameters. Inter individual variability (IIV) was modeled using exponential function. The inclusion of IIV terms on PK parameters was tested sequentially, with the most significant objective function value (OFV) reduction (P&lt;0.005) entering the model first. Inter-occasion variability (IOV) [19] was also evaluated. For the modeling dataset, two occasions were defined including baseline PK at week 1 and repeat PK profiling at week 26. For the full dataset, six occasions were defined according to the data density. Residual errors were modeled as combined proportional and additive errors.</p>
      <p id="p-00428-en" num="0404">Plots of IIV versus covariates were used to screen for potential demographic and clinical factors that affect rFIXFc PK. For continuous covariates, scatter plots of ETA (IIV code used in NONMEM) versus covariates were overlaid with a non-parametric locally weighted smoother LOESS line to determine functional relationships; for categorical covariates, box and whisker plots were used to identify potential differences between groups (data not shown). A clear trend of positive or negative slopes and noteworthy correlation coefficients (data not shown) would suggest a possible influence by the continuous covariates; pronounced differences among the groups would suggest a possible influence by the categorical covariates. After identifying potential covariates, a full stepwise forward addition (P&lt;0.005) and backward elimination (P&lt;0.001) procedure was conducted for covariate modeling.</p>
      <p id="p-00429-en" num="0405">Besides statistical considerations, model selection was also aided by goodness-of-ft plots, including DV versus population prediction (PRED), DV versus individual prediction (IPRED), conditional weighted residual (CWRES) versus TIME and PRED plots [20, 21]. Other diagnostics also helped to select the proper model, including parameter precision, ETA, and CWRES distribution and shenkage [22, 23].</p>
      <p id="p-00430-en" num="0406">Model Qualification: Bootstrapping was conducted with 1,000 datasets generated by random sampling through replacement [24]. Non-parametric median and 95% (2.5<sup>th </sup>and 97.5<sup>th </sup>percentiles) confidence intervals (CIs) of PK parameters were obtained and compared with final model estimates.</p>
      <p id="p-00431-en" num="0407">To check the predictive performance of the model, VPC was performed to obtain 1,000 simulated PK profiles [24]. Median, 10<sup>th </sup>and 90<sup>th </sup>percentile of simulated and observed FIX activities, stratified by dose (50 and 100 IU/kg), were plotted.</p>
      <p id="p-00432-en" num="0408">The trough/peak validation dataset was used to check the predictability of the model [16, 24, 25]. Specifically, the model was used to derive Bayesian feedback predictions of FIX activities at trough/peak time points by setting MAXEVAL=0 in NONMEM control stream. The mean relative prediction error (an indicator of accuracy) was calculated using Eq. 3.</p>

      <p id="p-00435-en" num="0410">Structural Model and Evaluation of IIV: Based on previous conventional PK analyses of rFIXFc [6], a two-compartment model appropriately described individual PK, hence a two-compartment model was evaluated first followed by a three-compartment model. IIV (ETA, Î· values) was assumed for clearance (CL) and volume of compartment 1 (V1). A covariance between CL and V1 was also included. The three-compartment model resulted in a reduction of OFV by over 400 units (for additional four parameters) compared with the two-compartment model, thus was selected as the base model. Primary PK parameters included CL, V1, volume of compartment 2 (V2) and 3 (V3), inter-compartmental clearance between compartments 1 and 2 (Q2), as well as between 1 and 3 (Q3). The inclusion of IIV for the rest of the PK parameters (V2, V3, Q2 and Q3) led to further improvement in the model fitting. However, IIV on Q3 was associated with a high standard error (87%), indicating that the data cannot support a precise estimation of IIV on Q3, which was thus not included in the model. No additional covariance between IIV of PK parameters could be estimated with precision, thus the only covariance between IIV retained in the model was the covariance between IIV on CL and V1.</p>
      <p id="p-00436-en" num="0411">Evaluation of IOV: Since the Arm 1 sequential PK subgroup had repeat PK profiles at week 26 in addition to baseline PK profiles at week 1, IOV was evaluated with baseline PK as occasion 1 and repeat PK as occasion 2. The inclusion of IOV on CL significantly improved the model with a reduction of OFV by 171.6 units. The inclusion of IOV on both CL and V1 achieved an additional OFV drop of 41.6 units, whereas IOV on V2 or Q2 did not improve the model fit (P&gt;0.05). The IOV on V3 improved the model fit at P&lt;0.005 but with a large percentage of relative standard error (78.4%); Therefore, IOV was only included for CL and V1.</p>
      <p id="p-00437-en" num="0412">Pairwise comparisons of CL and V1 estimates for baseline and repeat PK, derived from the base model with IOV, were plotted in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>. The changes of either CL or V1 between the two occasions were random and small with only one exception, and the mean CL or V1 for the two occasions were similar.</p>
      <p id="p-00438-en" num="0413">Overall, the inclusion of IOV reduced the corresponding IIV on CL and V1 from 24.0% and 29.6% to 21.1% and 24.2%, respectively. The inclusion of IOV also reduced proportional and additive residual errors from 12.1% and 0.30 IU/dL, to 10.5% and 0.24 IU/dL, respectively. The base model with IOV provided a reasonable fit to the data, and explained the random as well as small PK changes between occasions studied in the trial, therefore was chosen for farther covariate modeling.</p>
      <p id="p-00439-en" num="0414">Covariate Modeling: Based on ETA versus covariate plots, BW, albumin and race on CL, and âstudyâ on V2 were speculated to be potential covariates. Covariate modeling included BW on all PK, parameters, albumin on CL, and âstudyâ on V2 and CL. BW was assessed for all PK parameters because it is an important physiology factor. âStudyâ was assessed on CL because of the importance of CL.</p>
      <p id="p-00440-en" num="0415">A full stepwise forward addition and backward elimination procedure was performed. Following the forward covariate inclusion, the full covariate model was identified with BW on CL and V1, and âstudyâ on V2. However, âstudyâ on V2 was removed following the backward elimination procedure (P&gt;0.001).</p>
      <p id="p-00441-en" num="0416">Further, potential residual variability difference between the phase 1/2a and 3 studies was tested by including two sets of proportional and additive errors for two studies in, the residual error model. No significant reduction in OFV was observed (13.7 units, df=2). Therefore, although the phase 1/2a and phase 3 studios have different dosing and sampling schemes, the population PK modeling did not suggest a PK difference between the two studies.</p>
      <p id="p-00442-en" num="0417">Final Model: the final model of rFIXFc had IIV on CL/V1/Q2/V2/V3 but not Q3, IOV on CL and V1 and BW as a covariate on CL and V1. The model described the data well (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>). There were no outstanding trends observed in the CWRES plots and most CWRES randomly distributed between â2 and 2, indicating overall small discrepancies between measured FIX activities and population predictions (<figref>FIGS. 8C and 8D</figref>). Population PK parameter estimates, IIV and IOV, as well as residual errors were estimated with precision, evidenced by narrow 95% CIs for each PK parameter (Table 27). The IIV for CL and V1 were 17.7 and 21.7%, respectively, which are low to moderate, and IOV for CL and V1 were low at 15.1 and 17.4%, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00443-en" num="0418">The magnitude of ETA shrinkage on the IIVs was moderate (&lt;30% for all PK parameters with IIV terms), while the magnitude of ETA shrinkage on the IOV was occasion-specific, moderate at first occasion (around 30% on CL and V1) and higher at occasion 2 (around 70%) because there were fewer PK profiles for the second occasion (21 for occasion 2 repeat PK vs. 135 for occasion 1 baseline PK). The distributions of ETAs and CWRES showed approximate normal distribution centered around zero without apparent skewness (data not shown). This was consistent with the ETABAR P values, all of which were non-significant (P&gt;0.05).</p>
      <p id="p-00444-en" num="0419">Model Qualification: Non-parametric bootstrapping was applied to the final model to assess the model stability. Bootstrapping generated medians and Cis for the PK parameters, IIV and IOV estimates (Table 27). The median values from the bootstrapping were very similar to the model, estimates for all the PK parameters.</p>

The median and 80% interval (10th to 90th percentile) time-activity observed and predicted profiles nearly overlapped, indicating that the final model was able to reproduce both the central tendency and variability of the observed FIX activity time profiles.</p>
      <p id="p-00447-en" num="0421">The predictive capability of the final model was further evaluated using a validation dataset, which contains the trough/peak FIX activity records that were not included in the modeling dataset. The final model was used to derive the individual predictions for the trough and peak observations. Individual predictions showed good correlation (R2=0.9857, P&lt;0.001) with the observations (<figref>FIG. 10</figref>). The mean relative prediction error was low at â3.23%, indicating that the final model was qualified to predict rFIXFc PK in the hemophilia B patient population.</p>
      <p id="p-00448-en" num="0422">Full Dataset Model: Further, a population PK model of rFIXFc was also built based on the full dataset, including both PK profile and trough/peak data. The population parameter estimates of the resulting model, as well as IIV and IOV (Table 28), were comparable with those of the Enal model derived from the modeling dataset (Table 27). The goodness-of-fit plots indicated that the model also described the data adequately (<figref>FIG. 22</figref>). A slightly more over-prediction of FIX activity in the lower range (&lt;10 IU/dL) was observed for the VPC of the full dataset model. (<figref>FIGS. 9C and 9D</figref>).</p>

      <p id="p-00450-en" num="0423">This is the first systematic population PK modeling, of rFIXFc in patients with hemophilia B. A three-compartment model described the PK of rFIXFc well. For a typical 73-kg patient, V1 for rFIXFc at 71.4 dL is larger than the plasma volume, which is around 30 dL for a typical adult, indicating that rFIXFc is not limited in the plasma for the initial distribution phase after intravenous administration, similar to that of FIX which is known to bind to collagen IV in the subendothelium.[26] The IIV for CL and V1 were low to moderate at 17.7% and 21.7%, respectively, which are consistent with those reported for plasma-derived FIX (23% for CL and 19% for V1) [12]. Residual errors were small with a proportional error of 10.6% and additive error of 0.24 IU/dL. The proportional residual error is similar to the inter-assay variability of the one stage aPTT clotting assay. The small IIV and residual errors indicate that the model described the data adequately and rFIXFc PK do not vary substantially among patients. The estimated IOVs for CL and V1 were 15.1% and 17.4%, respectively, similar to those reported for plasma-derived FIX (15% for CL and 12% for V1) [12]. The small and randomly distributed IOV on CL and V1 indicate that rFIXFc PK is relatively stable at different occasions.</p>
      <p id="p-00451-en" num="0424">The approach of using the model to estimate baseline and differentiate baseline from residual activity for the pre-dose of each individual was investigated. However, the population modeling cannot reliably separate baseline from residual, activity because not every FIX activity profile returned to baseline at the last sampling time point, i.e., the baseline (endogenous) and exogenous signals were confounded. We also investigated setting baseline activity at 0, 0.5 or individualized baseline. The individualized baseline resulted in a relatively conservative PK estimates and more accurate prediction of the trough levels in individual subjects. Therefore, individualized baseline was chosen to handle the activity data in the population PK modeling, which was also utilized in the conventional PK analysis[8].</p>
      <p id="p-00452-en" num="0425">BW on CL and V1 was the only covariate that showed a statistically significant impact on, rFIXFc PK. It was suggested that the exponent of a physiological or PK parameter shall not revolve around a fixed number [27]. Hence, the exponents of BW on CL and V1 were estimated during the modeling instead of fixed at presumed values, e.g., 0.75 for CL and 1 for V1. The estimated BW exponents for CL and V1 in the final model were markedly lower at 0.436 and 0.396, respectively. Furthermore, inclusion of BW as a covariate decreased IIV for CL by only 3.4% and for V1 by only 2.5%, suggesting that a considerable portion of the variability was not explained by BW.</p>
      <p id="p-00453-en" num="0426">The limited impact of BW was not unique to rFIXFc PK, which was also observed for BeneFIX in the phase 3 study (data not shown). The weak correlation between BW and PK in our studies differs from a previous report, which showed that BW, with an exponent of 0.7 on CL, accounted for a significant portion of the variability in BeneFIX PK in a two-compartment population PK model [28]. The discrepancy probably can be explained by the different populations studied, i.e., the adult patients (&gt;19 years) in our study versus pooled data from 111 children (â¦15 years), including 53 infants (&lt;2 years) and 80 adults (&gt;15 years). This previous report represents a wider range for age and BW than in our study [29]. A recently published paper reported that BeneFIX PK in 56 patients aged 4-56 years and weighing 18-133 kg, described also by a three-compartment model, had allometric exponent of CL terms of 0.66 and volume terms of 0.64 [29]. The slightly reduced allometric exponent of CL compared with the previous report [28] might also be explained, by the difference of age and BW range studied.</p>
      <p id="p-00454-en" num="0427">Data splitting is a useful internal model validation approach in population PK modeling [24]. Because in the clinic intensive PK profile data are used to predict subsequent trough/peak sparse data, the data was split into modeling dataset including the intensive PK profile data from all the subjects at week 1 and week 26 and validation dataset including the sparse peak and trough data throughout the phase 3 study. To verify that our modeling strategy was robust, i.e., building the model with the baseline/repeat PK profiles without additional trough/peak FIX activity records, we also built the model using the full dataset consisting of all the FIX activity records from both the modeling and validation datasets. The two models were highly comparable with &lt;10% difference in the PK parameters, IIV and IOV estimates (Tables 27 and 28). The comparability between the two models was also demonstrated by the similar VPC plots for the two models (<figref>FIG. 9</figref>). FIX activities in the lower range (&lt;10 IU/dL) were slightly more over-predicted by the full dataset model. This difference might be attributed to the imprecise recordings of the peak/trough collection time in the full dataset, which was recorded by patients retrospectively into their electronic diary following the clinic visit. The final model derived from the modeling dataset is slightly more accurate in predicting trough levels, which is essential for maintenance of the therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, the final model derived from the modeling dataset is robust and predictive to be used for simulation of the dosing regimens for rFIXFc.</p>
      <p id="p-00455-en" num="0428">Finally, the population PK predictions were largely consistent with the results derived from the conventional two-stage PK analysis, which used a two-compartment model, despite a minority (Ë14%) of the PK profiles could also be described by a three compartmental model. The ambiguity in the model selection in the conventional PK analysis was at least partially due to the different sampling schemes in different study arms. Such ambiguity was avoided using population PK modeling. The post-hoc estimates from this population PK analysis were very similar to the results from the conventional PK analysis (Table 29; [8]). For example, the geometric mean V/2 estimated in population PK and conventional PK are 81.1 h and 82.1 h, respectively. The highly comparable PK parameters derived from a two-compartment conventional PK analysis and a three-compartment population PK analysis suggests that the contribution of the third compartment to rFIXFc PK was probably limited, but nevertheless provided better profile definition for the more complex population modeling. The advantage of developing a population PK model for rFIXFc is that the model can be utilized for dosing regimen simulation taking into account IIV and IOV, because FIX activity is considered as a surrogate for efficacy [12]; Further, the population PK model combined with individual sparse PK data can be used to derive an individualized dosing regimen through Bayesian estimation, which can alleviate the requirement for extensive sampling. Since hemophilia is a life-long disease impacting children as well as adults, the benefit of PK-tailored dosing regimens based on data from limited blood sampling is of great interest to the hemophilia community.</p>

      <p id="p-00457-en" num="0429">Conclusion: This is the first population PK analysis that systematically characterized the PK of the long-acting rFIXFc in patients with hemophilia B. The disposition of rFIXFc was well described by a three-compartment model with low to moderate IIV and IOV. Body weight was found to be the only statistically significant but weak covariate on CL and V1 with limited impact. The qualified population PK model for rFIXFc is accurate and predictive, providing a valuable tool to evaluate and optimize dosing regimens of rFIXFc for the treatment of patients with hemophilia B.</p>
