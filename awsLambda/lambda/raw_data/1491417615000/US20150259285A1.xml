    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">The invention provides a process for the production of 1 a compound of formula (I), said process comprising reacting a compound of formula (II), with a compound of formula (III), wherein R1 and R2 may be the same or different and are selected from H; a C1-C6 alkyl which may be straight or branched, substituted or unsubstituted; or R1 and R2 together represent an alkylidene group of the formula CRaRb wherein Ra and Rb may be the same or different and are selected from an alkyl group having between 1 and 6 atoms, and wherein R3 represents a C1-C6 alkyl group, wherein the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base. Using a base may advantageously allow a lower temperature and/or may result in a higher yield. Also, a phase separation step may be omitted.</p>

      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0006">The reaction of the invention is known to the skilled person as a Paal-Knorr condensation type reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0007">The inventors have surprisingly found that using a base may allow for a lower reaction temperature and/or may result in a higher yield. Also, a phase separation step may be omitted.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0008">The base may be added to the process in any order. For example it may be added together with the other reactants.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0009">The base may comprise a secondary amine. The skilled person would not be motivated a secondary amine to include in the process because secondary amines can react with ketone functional groups which are present in the compound of formula II and lead to unwanted side-products. Bases which can be used include cyclic or non-cyclic secondary aliphatic, aromatic or heteroaromatic amines such as diethylamine, piperidine, morpholine and di-isopropyl amine. A preferred base comprises di-isopropyl amine.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0010">The compound of formula II may comprise 2-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl]-4-methyl-3-oxopentanoic acid phenylamide.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0011">The compound of formula III may comprise an amine (i.e. as a free amine) or an organic or inorganic acid thereof, or mixtures thereof. Said compound may comprise an organic acid salt or inorganic acid salt of (4R, 6R)-1,3-dioxane-4-acetic acid, 6-(2-aminomethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-,1-methylethylester. Preferably the compound of formula III comprises an organic acid salt, more preferably pivalic acid salt.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0012">The reaction temperature and reaction time are such that the compound of formula I is produced. Suitable reaction temperatures may be between 50 and 100Â° C., preferably they range between 55 and 75Â° C., more preferably between 60 and 70Â° C. The temperature is preferably 95Â° C. or less, more preferably 90Â° C. or less, 85Â° C. or less, even more preferably 80Â° C. or less, most preferably it is 75Â° C. or less. The reaction time is less critical and may range e.g. between 10 and 100 hrs. Generally, at higher temperatures the reaction will proceed faster, whilst lower reaction times require longer reaction times. The skilled person can easily monitor the formation of the compound of formula I during the reaction, for example by HPLC, in order to determine when the reaction is completed.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0013">The reaction may be carried out in the presence of cyclohexane and/or N-methyl-pyrrolidone. Adding cyclohexane and/or N-methyl-pyrrolidone may results in a higher yield and/or may shorten the reaction time and/or facilitate the isolation,</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0014">The reaction may be carried out at a reduced pressure, i.e. below atmospheric pressure. Carrying out the reaction at reduced pressure may result in an even further increase of the yield and or reduction in reaction time. Preferably the reaction pressure is between 500-700 Torr, even more preferably between 600-650 Torr, preferably the reaction is carried out under vacuum. Torr is the generally accepted unit of pressure used in industrial processes and is well known to the person skilled in the art. The conversion is such that 100,000 Pa corresponds to 750.06 torr.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0015">The process of the invention is particularly suitable for the production of the atorvastatin intermediate ((4R,6R)-6-(2-(3-(phenylcarbamoyl)-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-isopropyl-4-phenyl-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)ethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-4-yl)acetic acid 1-methylethyl ester if the compound of formula II is an ester of 2-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl]-4-methyl-3-oxopentanoic acid phenylamide and if the compound of formula III is an organic acid salt or inorganic acid salt of (4R, 6R)-1,3-dioxane-4-acetic acid, 6-(2-aminomethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-,1-methylethylester. The atorvastatin intermediate can be used to produce atorvastatin hemi calcium salt. The intermediate may be isolated before it is converted to atorvastatin. The skilled person knows how to isolate said intermediate. For example, the isolation may include phase separation, for example using cyclohexane phase, precipitation, washing, e.g. using water/2-propanol, filtration etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0016">The invention further provides a process to produce atorvastatin hemi calcium salt of formula IV,</p>
