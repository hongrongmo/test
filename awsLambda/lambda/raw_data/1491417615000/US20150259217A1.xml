      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Metal oxide nanoparticles are useful in a variety of technologically important applications. Nanoparticle deposition is expected to be a promising alternative to current thin-film deposition technologies for low-temperature fabrication of metal oxide films. Metal oxide nanoparticle-inks can be deposited using existing roll-to-roll or ink-jet systems to realize low-cost, low-waste, highly scalable and high-speed manufacturing. In the case of nanoparticle films, sintering at high temperature may not be required because the crystalline nanoparticles are formed during chemical production.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Although solution deposition of metal oxide nanoparticle-inks is a versatile and simple approach to depositing metal oxide films, the synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles that are highly crystalline, monodisperse and precisely doped by a simple and reproducible general route remains a significant challenge. Metal oxide nanoparticles typically have been produced at high temperatures and under thermal decomposition conditions, and the synthesis parameters are difficult to control precisely. To achieve monodisperse nanocrystals, the reaction conditions are chosen to separate the nucleation and growth phases of the reaction. High temperatures are typically required to solubilize precursors, decompose the precursors, and/or convert (anneal) amorphous nanoparticles to the crystalline form. For example, monodispersed metal oxide nanoparticles have been synthesized by thermal decomposition or pyrolysis of metal organic precursors at temperatures greater than 300Â° C. (Park et al., <i>Ang. Chemie, </i>46:4630-60 (2007); Jana et al., <i>Chemistry of Materials, </i>16:3932-3935 (2004)). Extended reaction and aging times are often required to attain crystalline nanoparticles, and uniform doping or production of mixed oxide nanocrystals can be difficult because each metal precursor has a different decomposition temperature. The production of core/shell structures is challenging under these conditions because nucleation of new particles from the shell precursor competes with shell growth onto the core material. Finally, high temperatures preclude the use of thermally-sensitive organic chemical functionality within stabilizers and ligands.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Metal oxide nanoparticles also have been formed by alcoholysis and aminolysis of metal precursors (Park et al., <i>Ang. Chemie, </i>46:4630-4660 (2007); Narayanaswamy et al., <i>JACS, </i>128:10310-9 (2006); Gilstrap et al., <i>Adv. Mat., </i>20:4163-6 (2008)). However, these methods still use reaction temperatures above 290Â° C.</p>

      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Embodiments of a versatile, low-temperature method for synthesizing metal oxide, core/shell nanoparticles, and doped nanoparticles via an esterification reaction between a metal carboxylate and an alcohol are disclosed. The nanoparticles may be ligand-stabilized. Embodiments of the disclosed esterification process produce crystalline metal oxide nanoparticles with excellent control over the size, size dispersity, and doping level. Some embodiments of the disclosed method also can be used to produce core/shell nanocrystals by epitaxial growth of shells onto nanoparticle cores. Embodiments of the disclosed method can be performed at low temperatures (&lt;230Â° C.) using alcohols and carboxylic acids derived from non-toxic natural oils. In some embodiments, the reaction by-product, an ester, is also a non-toxic natural oil. Embodiments of the metal oxide and core/shell nanoparticles are useful in a variety of technologically important applications, and the nanoparticle properties can be optimized or otherwise tailored by carefully choosing and incorporating specific matrix metal elements and metal ion dopants.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">The lower temperature and enhanced control of the chemical reactivity facilitates synthesis of precisely doped nanocrystals and core/shell nanocrystals that enhance the functionalities of these nanocrystals. In the case of the doped nanocrystals, the esterification reaction addresses a significant challenge in the production of these types of nanocrystals from multiple precursors, that is to balance the reactivity of the two precursors. In the case of the core/shell structures, the ability to generate reactive precursors that can contribute to shell growth without resulting in nucleation of new nanocrystals is an advantage. Such lower temperature approaches may also aid in preserving kinetic structures formed in shape-controlled reactions that might be altered if reactions are conducted at higher temperatures.</p>

      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0092">The metal carboxylate/carboxylic acid mixture may be combined, without further purification, with the solvent comprising, or consisting essentially of, Râ²OH. Rapid reaction between the alcohol and metal carboxylate occurs to form an ester and a metal hydroxy species, as shown below in exemplary equation (1) where the metal is indium. Given the thermal stability of indium oleate at 230Â° C., but its rapid reaction to produce ester in the presence of oleyl alcohol, the initial step of the synthesis is the reaction of the alcohol with the metal carboxylate to form the ester and a metal hydroxy species (Eqn. 1). Although IR studies suggest that the ester formation continues, the amount of signal due to the complexed oleate does not decrease until all of the free oleic acid is consumed. Given that esterification at this temperature does not occur without the metal, the continued production of ester suggests that the free carboxylic acid is being consumed by a metal-catalyzed esterification reaction (Eqn. 2). Later in the addition, it is also possible that the growing nanocrystals can catalyze this reaction. Once the concentration of the indium hydroxy species increases, it can condense with other hydroxy species in a condensation reaction to nucleate and grow nanocrystals (Eqn. 3). Nanocrystal formation by condensation of the metal hydroxide species is supported by other examples in the literature (e.g., Kwon et al., <i>Acc. Chem. Res. </i>2008, 41, 1696-1709) and studies of the thermal decomposition of hydroxy indium(III) diacetate (Sawada et al., <i>J. Mass Spectrom. Soc. Jpn. </i>1998, 46, 292-295). In the latter case, decomposition begins at 207Â° C. producing water and acetic acid. This finding is also consistent with the observation that at lower temperatures (180-200Â° C.) the acid is consumed by esterification, but there is no condensation to produce nanoparticles. The presence of some surface hydroxy groups observed in the XPS is consistent with a growth mechanism involving M-OH species.</p>

      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0093">The water generated in Equations (2) and (3) might accelerate the hydrolysis of metal carboxylates to metal hydroxides that are subsequently dehydrated to metal oxides (Eqn. (3)). However, in some embodiments, superior control over nanocrystal formation occurs when water is generated relatively slowly and swept away by the nitrogen flow. Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory of operation, based upon these observations, controls and spectroscopic studies and the similar reactivity observed for the other metal oxides studied, it is believed that Equations (1)-(3) produce the overall nanocrystal formation reaction shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The initial reaction between the metal oleate and the solvent generates the ester and the metal hydroxy species. The hydroxy species can dehydrate to form M-O-M bonds, but in the early stages of reaction when the concentration of oleic acid is higher, a metal-catalyzed esterification (the lower loop in the scheme) competes with dehydration. The fact that the IR signals due to the metal oleate do not decrease until after the free acid is consumed is consistent with this reaction pathway. As the free acid is consumed, the dehydration reaction, which is facile at about 207Â° C., competes and leads to nanocrystal formation.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0094">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, conventional alcoholysis occurs when an alcohol, used as a reagent (i.e., not in a large molar excess as a solvent), is injected into a hot solution of metal carboxylate in a non-reactive organic solvent (e.g., 1-octadecene). The reaction is second-order, and its rate is dictated by the concentrations of metal carboxylate and alcohol (reaction step 1, <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>d</i>). As the reaction progresses, the concentrations of both the metal carboxylate and the alcohol decrease. As the concentrations decrease, the collision frequency between the metal carboxylate and the alcohol decreases, and the conversion rate from metal carboxylate to metal hydroxide slows. As a consequence, higher temperatures are required to maintain a rate that will drive the reaction to completion and/or produce reactive species through thermal decomposition. Typically, reaction temperatures near 300Â° C. for several hours are needed to complete the alcoholysis reaction and produce crystalline products.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0095">In contrast, in embodiments of the disclosed low-temperature esterification process, the non-reactive organic solvent is replaced with alcohol (<figref>FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>), thereby making the alcohol the solvent. The large excess of alcohol compared to metal carboxylate makes the process a pseudo-first-order reaction because the collision frequency between the metal carboxylate and alcohol molecules remains high (<figref>FIGS. 2</figref><i>b</i>, <b>2</b><i>c</i>). As a result, the esterification is complete, and the precursor is converted to metal hydroxide much faster (i.e., within minutes) than the second-order esterification (<figref>FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>c</i>), even when the process is performed at low temperatures (e.g., â¦230Â° C.).</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0096">The inventors surprisingly discovered that precise control over the metal oxide nanoparticle synthesis is obtainable by using an amount of carboxylic acid that is in stoichiometric excess relative to the metal, but limiting with respect to the alcohol.

In some embodiments, control is further enhanced by injecting a hot solution comprising metal carboxylate in carboxylic acid into the alcohol wherein the alcohol is present in sufficient amount to act as a solvent, thereby producing a pseudo-first-order reaction.

      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0107">Nanoparticle morphology depends at least in part on chemical structure. For example, spherical particles may dominate when surface defects are needed to minimize surface energies of the nanocrystal. On the other hand, faceted particles have different mechanisms to minimize surface energies. For example, in In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystals, {111} facets typically dominate as the most stable planes. However, some embodiments of the disclosed methods produced In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystals with a cube morphology having a surface comprising {001} facets. This finding was surprising for In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>because the facets typically are unstable due to their strong polarity. The importance of the surface energies in the growth of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystals has been discussed by using the lowest-indexed crystallographic planes. In general, the lowest-energy plane trend is Î³(111)&lt;Î³(011)&lt;Î³(211)&lt;Î³(001) (Agoston et al., <i>Physical Review B </i>84, 1-20 (2011)). However, if the In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystals were formed via hydroxide species, there are several reports that {001} facets are stable and form cubes (see, e.g., Hu et al., <i>Materials Chemistry and Physics </i>118, 227-280 (2009); Tang et al., <i>Crystal Growth </i>&amp; <i>Design </i>5, 147-150 (2005)). Agoston et al. reported that the {001} planes become more stable than {111} planes (Î³(001)&lt;Î³(111)) when the surface is terminated by water or hydroxide. Embodiments of the esterification process disclosed herein are consistent with this mechanism since the In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanoparticle originated via hydroxides. <figref>FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>d</i>-<b>5</b><i>f </i>demonstrate that the In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystals are cubes comprising polar, layered structures of metal-oxygen-metal coordination terminated by carboxylic acid molecules on the surfaces.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0108">Indium tin oxide (ITO) nanocrystals synthesized by some embodiments of the disclosed methods are truncated octahedrons surrounded by {001} and {111} facets. In some embodiments, the ITO nanoparticles are monodisperse, and the matrix phase of the nanoparticles is cubic In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>without any different phases. However, the truncated octahedron is an intermediate between a {001}-faceted cube and a {111}-faceted octahedron (Tao et al., <i>Small </i>4, 310-325 (2008)), and may be the predominant structure due to lattice distortion induced by tin doping. Tin doping induces lattice distortion, which changes the nanoparticle shape from a cube to a truncated octahedron.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0109">Some embodiments of Î³-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and CoO nanocrystals synthesized by the methods disclosed herein have {111} facet planes, which are polar planes analogous to those of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystals. If Î³-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>(space group P4<sub>1</sub>32) and CoO (space group: Fm-3m) are surrounded by {111} planes, the shape is predicted to be an icosahedron, a triangular pyramid, or an octahedron (see, e.g., <figref>FIG. 7</figref><i>e</i>). The shapes likely result from interactions between the carboxylic acid stabilizing molecules and the stable polar crystal planes for each shape. Thus, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory of operation, it appears that the carboxylic acid (e.g., oleic acid) has a role in determining crystal shape, as well as acting as a reagent in the esterification.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0110">Thus, in some embodiments, the metal oxide nanoparticles further comprise an outer layer comprising carboxylic acid (RCOOH) and RCOOâ ligands. The outer layer may further comprise Râ²OH, and/or Râ²Oâ ligands. The nanoparticles' morphology may be determined in part by the outer carboxylic acid layer. The negative, or partial negative, charge on the oxygen atoms facilitates binding to the positively charged metal atoms on the nanoparticle surfaces. Thus, the metal oxide nanoparticles terminate with an outer layer of metal atoms and associated carboxylic acid molecules, carboxylate ions, and/or alcohol molecules or ions. In some working examples utilizing oleic acid and oleyl alcohol, the nanoparticles terminated with an outer layer composed primarily of oleic acid with 2-11% oleyl alcohol. The morphology is determined by space groups of the crystals (see, e.g., <figref>FIG. 7</figref>). Advantageously, the use of long-chain fatty acids, e.g., oleic acid, as coordinating ligands in the production of nanoparticles facilitates morphology control while avoiding the toxicity of many surfactants.</p>

      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0111">Among the most interesting classes of nanoparticles are core/shell structures. Inorganic core/shell nanoparticles have become important functional materials because the crystalline shells can expand the range of physical and chemical properties as a class of hybrid nanomaterials. However, their synthesis requires greater control of the growth chemistry. Compared with amorphous shells (e.g. SiO<sub>2 </sub>or Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), production of crystalline shells utilizes nanocrystal cores for seed-mediated epitaxial growth in order to prevent undesirable nucleation, dumbbell formation, and aggregation.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0112">Embodiments of the disclosed core/shell nanocrystals include a crystalline metal oxide nanoparticle core as described above and a metal oxide shell. The metal oxide shell comprises a group IIIA metal, a group IVA metal, a transition metal, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the shell's metal oxide comprises a different metal than the core metal oxide. The core/shell nanoparticles may include a plurality of metal oxide shells. The core/shell nanoparticles may further comprise an outer layer comprising carboxylic acid molecules and/or carboxylate ligands. The outer layer also may comprise alcohol molecules/ligands.</p>

In working embodiments, metal oxide shells with a thickness of 2 nm were prepared. The thickness of the deposited metal oxide shell may depend, at least in part, on the concentration of the precursor metal carboxylate, (RCOO)<sub>z</sub>Mâ², the concentration of metal oxide cores, the reaction temperature, and/or the reaction time.</p>

      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0115">ZnO/Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystals are interesting because of their optical properties. The application of a wide band gap (E<sub>g</sub>: 4.6 eV, Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) semiconducting shell onto a narrow band gap (E<sub>g</sub>: 3.4 eV, ZnO) core should result in a higher band-edge luminescence than single-component semiconductor nanocrystals (e.g., CdSeâZnS core/shell quantum dots) because the surface defects of crystal core are passivated by the wide bandgap material. In addition, a Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>shell is chemically inert and will prevent dissolution of ZnO under acidic conditions. The dissolution of ZnO not only degrades the nanomaterial, but is also the origin of toxicity for ZnO nanomaterials.</p>

      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0122">The appropriate metal acetate (1 mmol) was mixed with oleic acid (2 mL) in a 15 mL glass vial and heated to 150Â° C. for 30 min (or one hour in the case of indium acetate) under a slow flow of nitrogen to generate the metal oleate complexes. The acetic acid boiled off during the reaction. Conversion to the oleate complex was confirmed by proton NMR. The metal oleate complexes can be synthesized and isolated by other methods described in the literature.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0123">Oleyl alcohol (12.5 mL) was heated to 230Â° C. in a 50 mL two-necked flask that had one neck fitted with a septum. The liquid was stirred magnetically at a rate sufficient to create a vortex down to the stir bar. Dry nitrogen was introduced through the septum via a 20 gauge stainless needle and the gas flow rate held at 1-5 sccm. The temperature of the oleyl alcohol was maintained using a heating mantle supplied by a temperature controller connected to a stainless thermocouple inserted through the septum into the liquid. The second neck of the flask was left open to atmosphere to allow nitrogen and water vapor to escape from the flask without condensation. If water condenses within the flask and drips into the reaction mixture, rapid hydrolysis of the metal precursor leads to immediate precipitation of agglomerated solid. A person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that other equipment configurations may be suitable as long as water vapor is allowed to escape from the flask.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0124">The hot metal oleate/oleic acid solution was injected through the septum from a 10 mL polypropylene syringe with a stainless 20 gauge needle with a syringe pump at 0.2 mL/min. During addition of the metal oleate precursor, the color of the reaction mixture changed from clear to colored. A continuous stream of water bubbles occurred throughout the transformation. The flow of nitrogen through the headspace of the flask swept the water out of the reaction mixture through the open neck. After the addition was complete, the solution was kept for 20 min at 230Â° C. with vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature, and a mixture of 25 mL of ethanol and 5 mL of methanol was added to precipitate the nanoparticles. The precipitate was isolated by centrifugation for 30 min at 7500 rpm. The solid product was washed six times with ethanol and then dissolved in toluene. The resulting toluene solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 5500 rpm to remove any insoluble solids. There should be no insoluble material after this centrifugation step.</p>

      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0142">Indium acetate and indium oleate thermally decompose at 270Â° C. and 340Â° C., respectively. Accordingly, temperatures were kept well below 270Â° C. to prevent thermal decomposition. As a control, the stability of indium (III) acetate in oleic acid at 250Â° C. over a two-hour period was confirmed by proton NMR analysis of aliquots of the solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0143">Additional observations shed some light on the role of the alcohol, metal complexes, water and excess oleic acid. When indium oleate was heated in oleic acid without added oleyl alcohol at 230Â° C. for one hour, the solution remained colorless and the proton NMR of the complex remained unchanged. When the complex was added to oleyl alcohol, fine bubbles of water were observed, resulting in the formation of foam across the surface of the reaction mixture. If water was allowed to condense in the reaction vessel and dropped back into the heated solution, the drops boiled violently and precipitate was formed. The same result was obtained if water was deliberately added. Color changes suggest that nanoparticles are forming (confirmed by TEM measurements) within 60 sec. of the beginning of the metal oleate addition. During the timeframe for these reactions, the production of water and formation of the ester did not occur without added metal, suggesting that the metal ion and/or its reaction products act as catalysts for esterification. Finally, the additional oleic acid used during the reaction functioned effectively to control the nucleation of the In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>clusters during the rapid esterification. If no excess oleic acid was used, larger aggregates were formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0144">These observations were augmented by IR and <sup>1</sup>H NMR studies of the indium reaction mixtures and several control solutions. <figref>FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>shows NMR spectra of the methylene protons next to the carboxylic acid and ester functionality for mixed solutions of oleic acid and oleyl alcohol after heating at 200Â° C. for 5 minutes with, and without, indium oleate. Oleic acid (3.3 mmol) and indium oleate (1 mmol) were dissolved in 12.5 mL (33.5 mmol) oleyl alcohol. The triplet peak 3 indicates carboxylic acid (oleic acid) and the triplet peaks 4 and 5 indicate ester (oleyl oleate). From the increase in the two triplet signals associated with the ester and disappearance of the triplet signal due to the acid, it is clear that esterification between oleic acid and oleyl alcohol proceeds only in the presence of indium oleate. Surprisingly, the oleic acid was completely converted to the ester within 5 minutes. The entire NMR spectra are shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>.</p>

At 230Â° C., the peaks for both oleic acid and indium oleate disappeared, suggesting that the esterification was nearly complete within 5 minutes, consistent with the NMR results.</p>

        <i>c </i>shows time dependence of the esterification and decomposition of indium oleate at 230Â° C. based upon the FT-IR peaks of the acid, metal carboxylate and ester. The IR intensities are normalized to the common peak at 1465 cm<sup>â1</sup>. At the initial stage of esterification (shorter than 50 sec), oleic acid is consumed very rapidly. During this time, the indium oleate remains constant. Once most of the acid is depleted, the indium oleate is consumed rapidly with continued production of ester and nucleation of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>clusters begins (determined by TEM). The presence of clusters was confirmed at 60 s. Taken together, these results suggest that indium oleate works as a catalyst for the esterification of oleic acid at 230Â° C. The other metal oleates display similar reactivities. This temperature is much lower than the thermal decomposition temperatures of indium acetate (270Â° C.) and indium oleate (340Â° C.).</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0147">Additional studies demonstrated that esterification occurs readily down to 140Â° C. However, nearly all of the indium oleate remains intact at this temperature without nucleation of clusters. The production of water suggests that the reaction involves esterification of oleic acid and oleyl alcohol. During the timeframe for these reactions, the esterification does not proceed without added metal.</p>

In the heat up approach, the metal oleate solution containing a small excess of oleic acid was heated up with a large excess of oleyl alcohol. In the hot injection trials, the metal oleate solution in oleic acid was injected into oleyl alcohol heated to 230Â° C. Surprisingly, both approaches failed. Using the heat up method, the size of the product nanocrystals could not be controlled. During rapid (Ë2 mL in 5 sec) hot injection, the formation of water and precipitation of metal oxide solids were observed during and after the injection period.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0149">A slower injection was done at rates slow enough that water could be swept away and precipitation did not occur.

Once the injection was completed, only 20 minutes of reaction time was needed to complete the metal hydroxide dehydration process to form the nanocrystals. This method led to reproducible nanocrystal formation without precipitation. The nitrogen flow prevented condensation of water droplets during the reaction. Upon addition of the indium oleate solution, the color of the solution turns from pale yellow to yellow, suggesting the formation of nanoparticles during the course of the addition. The presence of nanoparticles was confirmed at 60 seconds into the addition by TEM analysis of an aliquot of the reaction mixture that was removed and quenched by cooling. The nanocrystals were precipitated and washed to remove any free acid, alcohol and ester prior to characterization. Indium oxide nanocrystals were produced in greater than 90% yield, and showed no signs of aggregation in toluene solutions.</p>

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (<figref>FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>) and powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) (<figref>FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>) confirmed that the structure of the nanocrystal core was In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The nanocrystals' average diameter was 7.2 nmÂ±0.7 nm as determined from the histogram (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>). <figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>c </i>shows X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of C<sub>1s </sub>core levels for In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystals.

The interparticle edge-to-edge distance as shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>was 2.5-3.0 nm. This value was shorter than expected for two layers of extended oleic acid (4.0 nm), and implies some degree of interdigitation of the alkyl chains of ligands coordinated to different nanocrystals.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0152">The ligand shell composition was further investigated by ToF-SIMS (negative mode) that confirmed that the ligand shell was primarily oleic acid, containing less than 2% oleyl alcohol. All purified nanocrystals showed a peak at 281.26 m/z ([M-H] for oleic acid), confirming the presence of oleic acid within the stabilizing ligand shell. Weak signals occurred at 265.25 m/z ([M-3H] for oleyl alcohol) suggesting a small amount of that ligand in the shell. As synthesized, the normalized intensity of oleyl alcohol at 265.25 m/z was 16, and the normalized intensity of oleic acid at 281.26 m/z was 1310. These results indicated that the ligand shell included 2% oleyl alcohol and 98% oleic acid. In a control experiment, an In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>sample spiked with additional oleyl acid showed a relative increase in that fragment compared to the other samples, with an oleyl alcohol normalized intensity of 278, and an oleic acid normalized intensity of 3665.</p>

        <i>d </i>and <b>5</b><i>e </i>show a high-resolution TEM image of a typical In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystal and its fast Fourier transform (FFT), respectively. The In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystal's shape was a truncated cube, and the surface was surrounded mostly by {001} facets. This finding was surprising for In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>because the {001} facets typically are unstable due to their strong polarity, and therefore {111} facets dominate as the most stable planes. However, as previously discussed, if the In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystals were formed via hydroxide species, there are several reports that {001} facets are stable and form cubes (see, e.g., Hu et al., <i>Materials Chemistry and Physics </i>118, 227-280 (2009); Tang et al., <i>Crystal Growth </i>&amp; <i>Design </i>5, 147-150 (2005)). Thus, the production of cubic In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystals via esterification likely involves hydroxide intermediates. The presence of surface hydroxy species is suggested by a peak at 531.7 eV in the O1s XPS spectrum (<figref>FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>). The {001} facets of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystals are polar, layered structures of metal-oxygen-metal coordination terminated by oleic acid (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>f</i>).</p>

In all cases, this temperature is lower than the precursor decomposition temperature. It was confirmed that the synthesis worked at temperatures as low as 180Â° C. to synthesize these nanocrystals. Carrying out the reactions in air is advantageous because an inert atmosphere is not needed, and the aerobic environment may enhance oxidation of the nanocrystals, which facilitates crystallization and decreases oxygen vacancies. Antimony, copper, and silver also were evaluated, but did not produce nanocrystals.</p>

The crystal structures of each were determined by HR-TEM and confirmed by powder XRD. The Î³-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystals averaged 4.0 nmÂ±0.3 nm in diameter, and were icosahedrons or octahedrons surrounded by {111} facets (<figref>FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>).

In the XPS spectra, the spectra for the metal ions were consistent with the oxide forms identified by XRD. The O 1s spectra displayed peaks for the metal oxide and in all cases a smaller component at higher binding energy (531.1-537.7 eV depending upon the metal) consistent with a metal hydroxide species. Combined, the XRD results and the relatively smaller O 1s peak due to hydroxide suggested that there were hydroxy groups on the surface of the nanocrystals. As in the case of the In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystals, the main surface ligand detected by ToF-SIMS was oleic acid (Table 1). In each case, small amounts of oleyl alcohol (7-11%) were present in the ligand shells for these nanocrystals.</p>

The ITO nanocrystal was a truncated octahedron surrounded by {001} and {111} facets. {111} planes of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>are also partially polar planes, so that it is possible to be passivated by oleic acid. The truncated octahedron is an intermediate between a {001}-faceted cube and a {111}-faceted octahedron.

Since the value was higher than that of conventional ITO thin films (0 to 0.2%; Zhang et al., <i>J Phys.

      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0163">Î³-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MnO and ZnO/Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>core/shell nanocrystals were prepared. Î³-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and ZnO cores were prepared as described in Example 3. The purified cores were then dissolved in oleyl alcohol and heated to 160Â° C. under flowing nitrogen. Next, the metal oleates needed to form the shell were injected into the solution along with excess oleic acid and the reaction was maintained at this temperature for 1 hour. To prevent nucleation of new nanoparticles from the shell precursor, the temperature of solution was kept lower than nucleation temperatures for that metal oxide and oxygen was excluded.</p>

A 2-nm thick MnO shell was grown epitaxially onto the Î³-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>core. The size of the core was approximately 4.5 nm, corresponding to the diameter of the Î³-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>nanocrystals used as seeds in this synthesis. The high resolution TEM image shows a d-spacing of 0.30 nm, indicating {110} planes of MnO which have an epitaxial relationship with the {220} planes of Î³-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>(the lattice mismatch between the structures is 5.6%).</p>

The ZnO/Î²-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>core-shell nanocrystals showed a very different emission spectrum. The dominant emission peak was at 355 nm (compared with 371 nm in ZnO), and the yellow emission band disappeared upon addition of the shell. These results suggest that surface oxygen defects present in ZnO were passivated by the addition of the Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The bright blue emission band centered at 370 nm (3.35 eV) in the spectrum of the core-shell structure is the effect of oxygen vacancies in Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>shell, according to literature reports (Binet et al., <i>J.
