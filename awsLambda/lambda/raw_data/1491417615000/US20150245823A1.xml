      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">In addition, when the user does not manipulate the wireless probe <b>300</b> for a first time, the controller <b>340</b> blocks the first power and the second power and may provide the third power. The first time is a time necessary to obtain and process the ultrasound data and may vary depending on a specification of a product, for example, a data processing speed. In particular, the first time may be a time required to finish generation of the ultrasound data to be transmitted to an external medical device after the target object is completely scanned by the ultrasound reception/transmission module <b>310</b>, and the ultrasound data, which is obtained after the scanning of the target object is finished, is processed in the signal processing module <b>320</b>. Moreover, the user may autonomously set the first time.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">When the first time passes after the user does not manipulate the wireless probe <b>300</b>, the controller <b>340</b> supplies only the third power including the pairing power for the connection with the external medical device and may block the first power and the second power.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">In addition, when the user does not manipulate the wireless probe <b>300</b> for a second time that is greater than the first time, the controller <b>340</b> may block the first, second, and third power. The second time may be set by considering a time required to completely transmit the ultrasound data or the ultrasound image, which is generated in the signal processing module <b>320</b>, from the wireless communication module <b>330</b> to the external medical device. The user may autonomously set the second time. When the first, second, and third power is blocked, the wireless probe <b>300</b> is in a standby state.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0124">When the user does not manipulate the wireless probe <b>300</b> for a third time that is greater than the second time, the controller <b>340</b> completely turns off the wireless probe <b>300</b> and may not generate standby power required to maintain the wireless probe <b>300</b> in a standby state.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">Furthermore, the controller <b>340</b> may store a current state and environment settings of the wireless probe <b>300</b> before the wireless probe <b>300</b> is completely turned off. Accordingly, when the user turns on the wireless probe <b>300</b> to operate, the controller <b>340</b> may reboot the wireless probe <b>300</b> by using the stored state and environment settings. Hereinafter, a state in which the wireless probe <b>300</b> is completely turned off and the standby power is not consumed is referred to as a âpower-off stateâ, and a state in which the wireless probe <b>300</b> receives power in the power-off state and operates is referred to as a âpower-on stateâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0126">As described above, power that is necessary in a current operation state of the wireless probe <b>300</b> may be selectively supplied by selectively supplying or blocking voltages that are respectively applied to the ultrasound reception/transmission module <b>310</b>, the signal processing module <b>320</b>, and the wireless communication module <b>330</b> based on the operation state of the wireless probe <b>300</b>. Accordingly, the power consumption of the wireless probe <b>300</b> may be reduced by effectively blocking unnecessary power in consideration of the current operation state of the wireless probe <b>300</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0127">In detail, the operation state of the wireless probe <b>300</b> may be determined according to a detection result of the detector <b>370</b>, and the controller <b>340</b> may control the supply of the first power, the second power, and the third power according to the detection result of the detector <b>370</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0128">The detector <b>370</b> may include at least one of a gyro sensor, a position sensor, an acceleration sensor, a temperature sensor, and a touch sensor such as a pressure sensor. Operations of the detector <b>370</b> will be described in detail with reference to <figref>FIGS. 4A through 4C</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0129">In addition, the controller <b>340</b> may decrease or increase a voltage level of at least one of the first power, the second power, and the third power according to the operation state of the wireless probe <b>300</b>. For example, when the amount of power charged in the power unit <b>350</b> is decreased by a predetermined threshold value, a level of the high voltage included in the first power may be decreased by a predetermined offset value. For example, when the amount of the power charged in the power unit <b>350</b> is decreased by 30% or less, the controller <b>340</b> may control the high voltage, which will be supplied to the transducer <b>315</b>, to be decreased from about 100 V to about 70 V. As described above, when the first power is decreased and then applied to the wireless probe <b>300</b>, values of obtained ultrasound signals may be decreased. However, a maintaining time of the ultrasound scanning may be increased.</p>

      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0131">Referring to <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>, the detector <b>370</b> may include at least one of a temperature sensor (not shown), and a touch sensor (not shown) such as a pressure sensor in order to determine whether a user <b>420</b> performs the scanning by using the wireless probe <b>410</b>. For example, when the detector <b>370</b> includes the temperature sensor, the detector <b>370</b> detects a temperature of the user <b>420</b> when the user <b>420</b> contacts the wireless probe <b>410</b> and may determine that the user <b>420</b> manipulates the wireless probe <b>410</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0132">In addition, when the detector <b>370</b> includes the touch sensor, the detector <b>370</b> detects touches by the user <b>420</b> and may determine that the user <b>420</b> manipulates the wireless probe <b>410</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0133">Referring to <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, the detector <b>370</b> may include at least one of a gyro sensor (not shown) and a position sensor (not shown). The gyro sensor detects whether pressure is applied in a direction of gravity, and the position sensor detects a position of the wireless probe <b>410</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0134">In general, when the user <b>420</b> does not use the wireless probe <b>410</b>, the user <b>420</b> places a transducer of the wireless probe <b>410</b> to face upwards on a supporter <b>430</b> in order to protect an acoustic lens <b>411</b> disposed on an outer surface of the transducer. When the user <b>420</b> scans the target object by using the wireless probe <b>410</b>, the user <b>420</b> holds the wireless probe <b>410</b> backwards such that the acoustic lens <b>411</b> faces downwards. The gyro sensor or the position sensor may detect whether the acoustic lens <b>411</b> of the wireless probe <b>410</b> faces upwards or downwards as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0135">When the gyro sensor or the position sensor determines that the acoustic lens <b>411</b> faces upwards or is horizontally placed as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, the gyro sensor or the position sensor may determine that the user <b>420</b> does not manipulate the wireless probe <b>410</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0136">Referring to <figref>FIG. 4C</figref>, the detector <b>370</b> may include an acceleration sensor (not shown). When the user <b>420</b> contacts and moves the wireless probe <b>410</b> on the target object, the acceleration sensor detects movements on the target object and may determine that the user <b>420</b> manipulates the wireless probe <b>410</b>. Also, when the acceleration sensor does not detect the movements on the target object, the acceleration sensor may determine that the user <b>420</b> manipulates the wireless probe <b>410</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0137">The wireless probe <b>410</b> may not include the detector <b>370</b> and may determine whether the user performs the scanning of the target object by periodically transmitting the ultrasound signals. In general, when the user <b>420</b> scans the target object, the user <b>420</b> applies a gel for an ultrasound diagnosis on the acoustic lens <b>411</b> so as to improve the transmission of the ultrasound signals to the target object. In this case, types of the ultrasound echo signals received by the wireless probe <b>410</b> vary according to whether the gel is applied on the acoustic lens <b>411</b>. Therefore, the controller <b>340</b> of the wireless probe <b>410</b> may determine whether the user <b>420</b> scans the target object by periodically transmitting the ultrasound signals to the target object and observing the types of the ultrasound echo signals received by the wireless probe <b>410</b>.</p>
