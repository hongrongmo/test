      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to dishwasher appliances, and more particularly to vents for use with dishwasher appliances.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Modern dishwashers typically include a wash chamber where e.g., detergent, water, and heat can be applied to clean food or other materials from dishes and other articles being washed. Various cycles may be included as part of the overall cleaning process. For example, a typical, user-selected cleaning option may include a wash cycle and rinse cycle (referred to collectively as a wet cycle), as well as a drying cycle. A pre-wash cycle may also be included as part of the wet cycle, and may be automatic or an option for particularly soiled dishes.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In one or more of these cycles, particularly during the drying cycle, it may be desirable to allow heated fluidâtypically steamâto be vented from the wash chamber. Such venting allows e.g., for the removal of moisture from the dishes and helps dissipate heat from the drying cycle. Conversely, it is also desirable to retain fluids and heat during other parts of the cleaning process. For example, during the wet cycle, cleaning can be improved by keeping the wash chamber sealed so as to retain heat energy while a heated mixture of water and detergent is sprayed against the dishes and other articles. Maintaining a closed chamber during the pre-wash and wash cycle can also be necessary in order to prevent fluid from being ejected.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Conventionally, one or more vents have been provided near the top of the front door of the dishwasher to allow for the escape of fluid from the wash chamber. In some cases, active vents are utilized. The flow of fluid through such active vents is commonly controlled through a curtain or other cover that is driven by a motor connected through a drive mechanism. The motor must be electrically powered and activated at appropriate times during the cleaning process. As such, this conventional configuration typically adds expense to the manufacture and maintenance of a dishwashing appliance.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Accordingly, in other cases, passive vents are utilized. The flow of fluid through such passive vents is passively controlled based on the configuration of the vents, such as the sizes of the holes defined in the vent. During the wet cycle, water sheets the holes and prevents fluid flow through the vent. During the drying cycle, fluid is allowed to flow through the vent due to the lack of sheeting.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">One issue with known passive vent designs is that the surface tension of the water that sheets the holes must be overcome for the water to drain and the holes to open. In some known vent designs, the surface tension of the water can result in the holes remaining sheeted for extended periods of time, such as hours, after venting is desired. One solution to improve the drainage of such vents has been to add vertically extending ribs to the vent, which extend between the horizontally extending vent holes. The ribs facilitate water flow from the holes and thus allow proper water drainage. However, optimal operation of this vent design only occurs when the ribs are positioned vertically. Because vents are typically screwed into dishwasher appliance doors, it is difficult and time consuming to properly orient these vents.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Accordingly, improved vent designs for dishwasher appliances are desired. In particular, passive vents which provide improved liquid flow from apertures thereof, regardless of the orientation of the vent, would be advantageous.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>

      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">
        <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> depict an exemplary domestic dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> that may be configured in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. For the particular embodiment of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> includes a cabinet <b>102</b> having a tub <b>104</b> therein that defines a wash chamber <b>106</b>. Chamber <b>106</b> is configured for the receipt of articles for cleaning, such as dishes, cups, utensils, etc. The tub <b>104</b> includes a front opening (not shown) and a door <b>120</b> hinged at or near its bottom <b>122</b> for movement between a normally closed vertical position (shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>), wherein the wash chamber <b>106</b> is sealed shut for washing operation, and a horizontal open position for loading and unloading of articles from the dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>. Latch <b>123</b> may in some embodiments be used to lock and unlock door <b>120</b> for access to chamber <b>106</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Upper and lower guide rails <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> are mounted on tub side walls <b>128</b> and accommodate roller-equipped rack assemblies <b>130</b> and <b>132</b>. Each of the rack assemblies <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> may be fabricated into lattice structures including a plurality of elongated members <b>134</b> (for clarity of illustration, not all elongated members making up assemblies <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> are shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>). Each rack <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> is adapted for movement between an extended loading position (not shown) in which the rack is substantially positioned outside the wash chamber <b>106</b>, and a retracted position (shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) in which the rack is located inside the wash chamber <b>106</b>. This is facilitated by rollers <b>135</b> and <b>139</b>, for example, mounted onto racks <b>130</b> and <b>132</b>, respectively. A silverware basket (not shown) may be removably attached to rack assembly <b>132</b> and/or <b>130</b> for placement of silverware, utensils, and the like, that are otherwise too small to be accommodated by the racks <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> further includes a lower spray-arm assembly <b>144</b> that is rotatably mounted within a lower region <b>146</b> of the wash chamber <b>106</b> and above a tub sump portion <b>142</b> so as to rotate in relatively close proximity to rack assembly <b>132</b>. A mid-level spray-arm assembly <b>148</b> is located in an upper region of the wash chamber <b>106</b> and may be located in close proximity to upper rack <b>130</b>. Additionally, an upper spray assembly <b>150</b> may be located above the upper rack <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The lower and mid-level spray-arm assemblies <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> and the upper spray assembly <b>150</b> are fed by a fluid circulation assembly <b>152</b> for circulating water and dishwasher fluid in the tub <b>104</b>. The fluid circulation assembly <b>152</b> may include a pump <b>154</b> located in a machinery compartment <b>140</b> located below the bottom sump portion <b>142</b> of the tub <b>104</b>, as generally recognized in the art. Each spray-arm assembly <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> includes an arrangement of discharge ports or orifices for directing washing liquid onto dishes or other articles located in rack assemblies <b>130</b> and <b>132</b>. The arrangement of the discharge ports in spray-arm assemblies <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> provides a rotational force by virtue of washing fluid flowing through the discharge ports. The resultant rotation of the lower spray-arm assembly <b>144</b> provides coverage of dishes and other dishwasher contents with a washing spray.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The dishwasher <b>100</b> is further equipped with a controller <b>137</b> to regulate operation of the dishwasher <b>100</b>.

      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In general, dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> may utilize a variety of cycles to wash and, optionally, dry articles within chamber <b>106</b>. For example, a wet cycle is utilized to wash articles. The wet cycle may include a main wash cycle and a rinse cycle, as well as an optional pre-wash cycle. During each such cycle, water or another suitable liquid may be utilized in chamber <b>106</b> to interact with and clean articles therein. Such liquid may, for example, be directed into chamber <b>106</b> from lower and mid-level spray-arm assemblies <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> and the upper spray assembly <b>150</b>. The liquid may additionally mix with, for example, detergent or other various additives which are released into the chamber during various sub-cycles of the wet cycle. A drying cycle may be utilized to dry articles after washing. During a drying cycle, for example, a heating element (not shown) may heat the chamber <b>106</b> to facilitate drying of the articles and evaporation of liquid within the chamber <b>106</b>. In generally, no liquid is sprayed or otherwise produced during the drying cycle.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">It should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to any particular style, model, or other configuration of dishwasher, and that the embodiment depicted in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is for illustrative purposes only. For example, instead of the racks <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the dishwasher <b>100</b> may be of a known configuration that utilizes drawers that pull out from the cabinet and are accessible from the top for loading and unloading of articles. Other configurations may be used as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> provides a perspective view of door <b>120</b>. Door <b>120</b> includes a bottom <b>122</b> (which is typically hollow, but may alternatively include a wall) as well as an interior wall <b>160</b> and an exterior wall <b>162</b>. The interior wall <b>160</b> and exterior wall <b>162</b> define a door interior <b>164</b> therebetween. Door <b>120</b> additionally includes a left side wall <b>166</b>, right side wall <b>168</b>, and top side wall <b>170</b>, as illustrated. Further, by way of example, door <b>120</b> includes a tray <b>172</b> for the receipt of dishwashing detergent and a compartment <b>174</b> for rinse cycle additives.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In exemplary embodiments, door <b>120</b> is formed from an inner door section and an outer door section. The inner door section includes the interior wall <b>160</b>, while the outer door section includes the exterior wall <b>162</b>. The inner and outer door sections are fastened together to form the door <b>120</b>, and to define the interior <b>164</b> between the walls <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Referring still to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, a vent <b>180</b> may be provided and received into the door <b>120</b>, such as into the interior wall <b>160</b>, for controlling the egress of fluid from the chamber <b>106</b>. Vent <b>180</b> may be located near top side wall <b>170</b> and/or at any suitable location on the door <b>120</b>. Vent <b>180</b> may include one or more apertures assemblies <b>182</b> defined in vent <b>180</b> through which a fluid such as e.g., steam or air may flow to escape from chamber <b>106</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In exemplary embodiments, vent <b>180</b> is a passive vent. In these embodiments, no active mechanical or electronic mechanisms are utilized to control vent <b>180</b> and aperture assembly <b>182</b> opening and closing to control the egress of fluid therethrough. Rather, such control is provided passively based, for example, on the size, shape, number and positioning of aperture assemblies <b>182</b>. For example, during the wet cycle, liquid contacting the vent <b>180</b> may sheet the vent <b>180</b>, thus covering the aperture assemblies <b>182</b> with a sheet of liquid and preventing the egress of fluid therethrough. During the drying cycle, no sheeting occurs and the aperture assemblies <b>182</b> are thus not covered, so fluid may egress through aperture assemblies <b>182</b>. In alternative embodiments, vent <b>180</b> may be an active vent, and various mechanical and/or electronic mechanisms, as are generally known in the art, may be utilized to control vent <b>180</b> and aperture assemblies <b>182</b> opening and closing to control the egress of fluid therethrough. Such mechanical and/or electronic mechanisms may, for example, be in communication with controller <b>137</b>, and may actuate based on signals from the controller <b>137</b> to selectively prevent or allow egress of fluid through apertures <b>182</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Referring still to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, a conduit <b>190</b> may be disposed within the door <b>120</b>. Conduit <b>190</b> may provide a path for the flow of fluid that passes through vent <b>180</b> to be exhausted from the dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>. Conduit <b>190</b> may, for example, define a passage <b>192</b> extending between a first end <b>194</b> and a second end <b>196</b>, each of which is an opening for access to the passage <b>192</b>. The first end <b>194</b> may, for example, be defined in the door <b>120</b>, such as in the interior wall <b>160</b> thereof, and may be provided for the egress of fluid from the chamber <b>106</b>. Vent <b>180</b> may generally cover and be received in or on the first end <b>194</b>, such that fluid that flows through apertures <b>182</b> further flows through first end, egressing from chamber <b>106</b> into conduit <b>190</b>. The second end <b>196</b> may additionally be defined in the door <b>120</b> and provided for the egress of fluid from the conduit <b>190</b>. Second end <b>196</b> may, for example, be defined proximate, such as within the area defining, the bottom <b>122</b> of the door <b>120</b>. Accordingly, fluid may flow through apertures <b>182</b> into passage <b>192</b> of conduit <b>190</b>, and from passage <b>192</b> through second end <b>196</b> to exterior of the dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In some embodiments, conduit <b>190</b> is a separate component from the inner door section and outer door section. Alternatively, conduit <b>190</b> may be integral with the inner door section, or the outer door section.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, various embodiments of vent <b>180</b> are illustrated. As discussed, vent <b>180</b> in exemplary embodiments is a passive vent <b>180</b>. Accordingly, vents <b>180</b> according to the present disclosure advantageously facilitate the quick and efficient flow of liquid from aperture assemblies <b>182</b> thereof during dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> operation after completion of the wet cycle. Thus, dry cycle venting of the dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> is improved. Additionally, vents <b>180</b> according to the present disclosure facilitate such quick and efficient liquid flow without regard to the orientation of the vents <b>180</b> as installed in the associated dishwasher appliances <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">As illustrated, a vent <b>180</b> according to the present disclosure includes a generally planer body <b>200</b>. The body <b>200</b> in exemplary embodiments is generally circular, as illustrated. Alternatively, however, the body <b>200</b> may be oval, rectangular, or have any other suitable shape. Connectors may extend from the body <b>200</b> to connect the vent <b>180</b> to the door <b>120</b>. For example, as illustrated vent <b>180</b> may include a threaded member <b>202</b> having threads <b>204</b> which mate with mating threads (not shown) of a receiving bore, such as first end <b>194</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">As mentioned, vent <b>180</b> may further include a plurality of aperture assemblies <b>182</b>. Each aperture assembly <b>182</b> may be defined in the body <b>200</b>. Further, as illustrated, each aperture assembly <b>182</b> may extend generally radially within the plane defined by the planer body <b>200</b>. Accordingly, each aperture assembly <b>182</b> may be oriented to generally diverge from a centerpoint of the body. It should be noted that body <b>200</b> need not be circular for aperture assemblies <b>182</b> to extend radially within the plane, although circular bodies are utilized in exemplary embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Referring to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, in some embodiments, aperture assemblies <b>182</b> each include a slot <b>210</b>. In exemplary embodiments, the slot <b>210</b> may have a generally rectangular cross-sectional shape, as illustrated. The slot <b>210</b> may thus extend generally radially, such that for example a major side of the rectangle is aligned radially within the plane.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Referring to <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, in alternative embodiments, aperture assemblies <b>182</b> each include a plurality of bore holes <b>212</b>, which may be aligned in a generally linear array to form an aperture assembly <b>182</b>. In exemplary embodiments, each bore hole <b>212</b> may have a generally circular cross-sectional shape. The linear array of bore holes <b>212</b> may thus extend generally radially, such that for example the orientation of the linear array is aligned radially within the plane.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Referring again to <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, a vent <b>180</b> according to the present disclosure may further include a plurality of ribs <b>220</b>. Each rib <b>220</b> may extend from the body <b>180</b>. Ribs <b>220</b> may generally facilitate the quick and efficient drainage of liquid from the aperture assemblies <b>182</b> when desired, such as after a wet cycle and/or at the commencement of a drying cycle.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">For example, each rib <b>220</b> may include a rib body <b>222</b> and one or more protrusions <b>224</b>. The rib body <b>222</b> may extend from the body <b>200</b>, such as generally towards and into the passage <b>192</b> when the vent <b>180</b> is received in the door <b>120</b>. Each protrusion <b>224</b> from the rib body <b>222</b> into one of the plurality of aperture assemblies <b>182</b>, such as into a slot <b>210</b> (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>) or bore hole <b>212</b> (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>) thereof. Further, each protrusion may at least partially form a sidewall of that aperture assembly <b>182</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">For example, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, a slot <b>210</b> may include one or more sidewalls <b>230</b>, such as a plurality of sidewalls <b>230</b> as illustrated. Protrusion <b>224</b> may form one of the plurality of sidewalls <b>230</b>. In alternative embodiments, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, a bore hole <b>212</b> may include one or more sidewalls <b>232</b>, such as a single continuous sidewall <b>232</b> as illustrated. Protrusion <b>224</b> may form a portion of the sidewall <b>232</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In exemplary embodiments, the protrusions <b>224</b> are integral with the rib body <b>222</b>. Alternatively, protrusions <b>224</b> may be separate components from the rib body <b>222</b> that are suitably connected thereto (such as via a suitable adhesive). Further, in exemplary embodiments, the protrusions <b>224</b> and/or rib bodies <b>222</b> are integral with the body <b>200</b>. Alternatively, protrusions <b>224</b> and/or rib bodies <b>222</b> may be separate components from the body <b>200</b> that are suitably connected thereto (such as via a suitable adhesive).</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Ribs <b>220</b>, and specifically the rib bodies <b>222</b> thereof, may have any suitable shapes. For example, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, in some embodiments, a rib body <b>222</b> may be generally curvilinear, such as generally circular. <figref>FIG. 4</figref> thus illustrates a plurality of arrays of generally radially extending slots <b>210</b> (two are shown), each array surrounded by one or more ribs <b>220</b> having curvilinear rib bodies <b>222</b>. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, in other embodiments, a rib body <b>222</b> may be generally linear. <figref>FIG. 5</figref> thus illustrates a plurality of linear arrays of bore holes <b>212</b> and a plurality of ribs <b>220</b> having linear rib bodies <b>222</b>, each rib body generally extending parallel to the associated array of bore holes <b>212</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The radial orientation of the aperture arrays <b>182</b> of vents <b>180</b> according to the present disclosure advantageously facilitates quick and efficient liquid drainage therefrom regardless of the orientation of the vents <b>180</b>. Further, the use of ribs <b>220</b> having protrusions <b>224</b> which form at least portions of sidewalls of the aperture arrays <b>182</b> facilitates quick and efficient liquid drainage by providing a path for the liquid to drain from the aperture arrays <b>182</b>, such that surface tension issues are minimized.</p>
