      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for producing (2R)âN-({5-[3-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-2-(1,3-dihydro-2H-benzoimidazol-2-ylidene)-3-oxopropanoyl]-2-fluorophenyl}sulfonyl)-2-hydroxypropanimidamide (hereinafter referred to as a âcompound Aâ or âa compound of the formula (I)â in some cases), or a synthesis intermediate in the production method. The present invention further relates to a crystal of the compound of the formula (I).</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">It is known that the compound A has an excellent gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonistic action and is useful as a therapeutic agent for gonadotropin-dependent diseases (for example, prostate cancer, breast cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroid, prostatic hyperplasia, or the like) (Patent Document 1).</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In Patent Document 1, the compound A is disclosed in Example 726 and it is described that the compound A is produced by the same method as the compound of Example 696. Here, it is described that the compound of Example 696 is produced by subjecting (2R)-2-hydroxypropanimidamide hydrochloride to a sulfonyl amidination reaction with 5-[2-(1,3-dihydro-2H-benzoimidazol-2-ylidene)-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-3-oxopropanoyl]-2-fluorobenzenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of sodium hydride, in tetrahydrofuran, followed by a liquid separation operation and purification with columns. However, this production method requires purification with columns so as to remove the impurities and thus, it has been desired to establish a production method for obtaining a compound A at a high purity, which is suitable for industrial production, without carrying out purification with columns.</p>

      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to provide a production method for obtaining a compound A with a high purity, which is suitable for industrial production, without carrying out purification with columns.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The present inventors have investigated a production method for obtaining a compound A with a high purity, which is suitable for industrial production, without carrying out purification with columns, and first, they have further conducted tests on the production method described in Patent Document 1 (sulfonyl amidination). As a result, it has been proven that in the production method, the compound A that is a target product is obtained with a purity of 80.27%, but a compound B shown below is contained as a by-product in the amount of 7.49%, which is hardly removed if the purification is not carried out with columns and, further, the compound A is slightly racemized (for details, refer to Comparative Example as described later).</p>

      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0007">Accordingly, as a result of investigation of an approach to control the by-product of the compound B, it has been conceived to provide a step of protecting-deprotecting a hydroxyl group of (2R)-2-hydroxypropanimidamide hydrochloride in the sulfonyl amidination, and various protective groups have been investigated. As a result, it has been unexpectedly found that in the case of employing a 2-tetrahydropyranyl group as the protective group, a by-product of the compound B which is hardly removed without purification with columns is controlled, and further, racemization of the compound A is also remarkably controlled. Based on these findings, a production method for obtaining a compound A with a high purity, which is suitable for industrial production, without carrying out purification with columns, is established, thereby completing the present invention.</p>

      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0029">(Step 1)</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0030">The present step is a step of obtaining (2R)-2-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yloxy)propanimidamide hydrochloride (2) by 2-tetrahydropyranylation of a hydroxyl group of (2R)-2-hydroxypropanimidamide hydrochloride (1). In this reaction, the compound (1) and 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran (DHP) are used in equivalent amounts, or either thereof in an excess amount, and a mixture thereof is stirred in a solvent which is inert to the reaction, in a range from cooling to heating, preferably from ice-cooling to 40Â° C., in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid, usually for 1 hour to 2 days. Examples of the solvent used herein are not particularly limited as long as the compound (1) is dissolved therein, but in one embodiment, examples of the solvent include N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI), and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Examples of the acid are not particularly limited, but in one embodiment, include p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate, and methanesulfonic acid. Further, the compound (2) may be isolated and then used in the next reaction, or may be used to perform the next reaction without being isolated.</p>

In this reaction, the compound (2) and the compound (3) are used in equivalent amounts, or either thereof in an excess amount, and a mixture thereof is stirred in a solvent which is inert to the reaction, in a range from cooling to heating, preferably from ice-cooling to 40Â° C., in the presence of a base, usually for 1 hour to 2 days.

Further, the compound (4) may be isolated and then used in the next reaction, or may be used to perform the next reaction without being isolated.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0033">(Step 3)</p>

Further, the compound disclosed in the present specification may be any compound labeled with various radioactive or non-radioactive isotopes, and for the synthesis intermediate, a production method using the same is also included in the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0039">Further, the compounds disclosed in the present specification may exist in the form of tautomers or geometrical isomers in some cases. In the present specification, the compounds having the tautomers or geometrical isomers shall be described in only one form of isomer, yet the present invention may also include other tautomers or geometrical isomers thereof, isolated forms of the tautomers or geometrical isomers, or a mixture thereof.</p>

Salt of the compounds disclosed in the present specification may also be prepared by subjecting a free form to a conventional salt forming reaction.</p>

Specifically, the compound (1) was reacted with 1.05 to 1.2 equivalents of the corresponding silyl chloride in the presence of 2.1 to 2.5 equivalents of triethylamine and 0.05 equivalents of 4-dimethylaminopyridine at room temperature, and then water was added thereto to carry out a liquid separation operation. The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was reacted with the compound (3) at room temperature and post-treated similarly to the Example 3. The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was treated with 1.2 equivalents of tetrabutylammonium fluoride and 1.2 equivalents of acetate at 0Â° C. in THF, and then water and AcOEt were added thereto to carry out a liquid separation operation. The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure, the obtained residue was analyzed by HPLC under the same conditions as in Examples 3 and 7, and the racemization rate of the obtained compound A was calculated from the HPLC area percentage. As a result, the racemization rate of the obtained compound A was each 4.16% to 4.22%, 0.60% to 0.65%, and 0.56% to 0.57%, the respectively, in the case of using a TBDMS group, a TBDPS group, and a TIPS group. Further, the TMS-protection of a hydroxyl group of the compound (1) becomes complicated in the reaction system, and thus, a DMPS-protection did not proceed and in any case, a compound having a desired hydroxyl group protected could not be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0149">From the results of Examples 3 and 7 and Comparative Example 2, it can be seen that as a protective group for the hydroxyl group of the compound (1), the 2-tetrahydropyranyl group of the production method of the present invention is excellent from the viewpoint of control of racemization of the compound A.</p>
