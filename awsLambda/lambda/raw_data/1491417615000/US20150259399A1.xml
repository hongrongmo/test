      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Described herein are systems and methods for generating antibodies with (a) improved specificity, (b) significantly increased potency, or combination thereof. In some embodiments, the systems and methods are more efficient and rapid than current approaches.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In some embodiments, the absence of self-tolerance enables these systems to generate antibodies without significant (or any) immunological constraints. The systems and approaches allow the generation of antibody specificities that cannot be accomplished by current immunization procedures.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In some embodiments, the cognate antigen drives B-cell neoplasia in vivo, and allows for the selection of the antibody producing cells that will develop into lymphoma and the resulting monoclonal antibody producing cell lines. Such systems and approaches accelerate the time for antibody development, as such systems and approaches allow screening of the resulting monoclonal antibodies to be performed in a directed manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In some embodiments, the methods and systems described herein provide the ability to generate and clonally expand antibody producing cell lines from tumors, thus eliminating the need for cell fusion of the antibody producing splenic B-cells with a myeloma fusion partner. The cell fusion process, described in the art, is fairly inefficient and only allows for the immortalization of a fraction of the B-cells that proliferate after immunization, and hence, limits the number and variety of antigen specific monoclonal antibodies obtained.</p>

      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">To determine the percent homology of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acids, the sequences can be aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps are introduced in the sequence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino or nucleic acid sequence). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions can then be compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent homology between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity=# of identical positions/total # of positions (e.g., overlapping positions)Ã100). In some embodiments, the two sequences are the same length.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">To determine percent homology between two sequences, the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:2264-2268, modified as in Karlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5877 is used. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul, et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410. BLAST nucleotide searches are performed with the NBLAST program, score=100, wordlength=12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecules described or disclose herein. BLAST protein searches are performed with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST is utilized as described in Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402. When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) are used. See the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information for further details (on the World Wide Web at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Proteins suitable for use in the methods described herein also includes proteins having between 1 to 15 amino acid changes, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 amino acid substitutions, deletions, or additions, compared to the amino acid sequence of any protein described herein. In other embodiments, the altered amino acid sequence is at least 75% identical, e.g., 77%, 80%, 82%, 85%, 88%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical to the amino acid sequence of any protein inhibitor described herein. Such sequence-variant proteins are suitable for the methods described herein as long as the altered amino acid sequence retains sufficient biological activity to be functional in the compositions and methods described herein. Where amino acid substitutions are made, the substitutions should be conservative amino acid substitutions. Among the common amino acids, for example, a âconservative amino acid substitutionâ is illustrated by a substitution among amino acids within each of the following groups: (1) glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine, (2) phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, (3) serine and threonine, (4) aspartate and glutamate, (5) glutamine and asparagine, and (6) lysine, arginine and histidine. The BLOSUM62 table is an amino acid substitution matrix derived from about 2,000 local multiple alignments of protein sequence segments, representing highly conserved regions of more than 500 groups of related proteins (Henikoff et al (1992), <i>Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA</i>, 89:10915-10919). Accordingly, the BLOSUM62 substitution frequencies are used to define conservative amino acid substitutions that, in some embodiments, are introduced into the amino acid sequences described or disclosed herein. Although it is possible to design amino acid substitutions based solely upon chemical properties (as discussed above), the language âconservative amino acid substitutionâ preferably refers to a substitution represented by a BLOSUM62 value of greater than â1. For example, an amino acid substitution is conservative if the substitution is characterized by a BLOSUM62 value of 0, 1, 2, or 3. According to this system, preferred conservative amino acid substitutions are characterized by a BLOSUM62 value of at least 1 (e.g., 1, 2 or 3), while more preferred conservative amino acid substitutions are characterized by a BLOSUM62 value of at least 2 (e.g., 2 or 3).</p>

The terms âantibodyâ and immunoglobulin are used interchangeably in the broadest sense. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of the different classes of immunoglobulins are well known in the art. In some embodiments, an antibody is part of a larger molecule, formed by covalent or non-covalent association of the antibody with one or more other proteins or peptides.</p>

These terms particularly refer to an antibody with heavy chains contains Fc regions. In some embodiments, an antibody variant provided herein is a full length antibody. In some embodiments, the full length antibody is human, humanized, chimeric, and/or affinity matured.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">An âaffinity maturedâ antibody is one having one or more alteration in one or more CDRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by suitable procedures. See, for example, Marks et al., (1992) <i>Biotechnology </i>10:779-783 that describes affinity maturation by variable heavy chain (VH) and variable light chain (VL) domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and/or framework residues is described in: Barbas, et al. (1994) <i>Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci, USA </i>91:3809-3813; Shier et al., (1995) <i>Gene </i>169:147-155; Yelton et al., 1995<i>, J. Immunol. </i>155:1994-2004; Jackson et al., 1995<i>, J. Immunol. </i>154(7):3310-9; and Hawkins et al, (19920<i>, J. Mol. Biol. </i>226:889-896, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The terms âbinding fragmentâ, âantibody fragmentâ or âantigen binding fragmentâ are used herein, for purposes of the specification and claims, to mean a portion or fragment of an intact antibody molecule, preferably wherein the fragment retains antigen-binding function. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fabâ², F(abâ²)<sub>2</sub>, Fd, Fdâ² and Fv fragments, diabodies, linear antibodies (Zapata et al. (1995) <i>Protein Eng. </i>10: 1057), single-chain antibody molecules, single-chain binding polypeptides, scFv, bivalent scFv, tetravalent scFv, and bispecific or multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">âFabâ fragments are typically produced by papain digestion of antibodies resulting in the production of two identical antigen-binding fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site and a residual âFcâ fragment. Pepsin treatment yields a F(abâ²)2 fragment that has two antigen-combining sites capable of cross-linking antigen. An âFvâ is the minimum antibody fragment that contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. In a two-chain Fv species, this region consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv (scFv) species, one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain are covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains associate in a âdimericâ structure analogous to that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although usually at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (C<sub>H</sub>1) of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fabâ² fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy-chain C<sub>H</sub>1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fabâ²-SH is the designation herein for Fabâ² in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(abâ²)<sub>2 </sub>antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fabâ² fragments that have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also suitable. Methods for producing the various fragments from monoclonal Abs include, e.g., PlÃ¼ckthun, 1992, Immunol. Rev. 130:152-188.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The term âmonoclonal antibodyâ refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that are present in minor amounts. In some embodiments, monoclonal antibodies are made, for example, by the hybridoma method first described by KÃ¶hler and Milstein (1975) <i>Nature </i>256:495, or are made by recombinant methods, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. In some embodiments, monoclonal antibodies are isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., <i>Nature </i>352:624-628 (1991), as well as in Marks et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>222:581-597 (1991).</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The antibodies herein include monoclonal, polyclonal, recombinant, chimeric, humanized, bi-specific, grafted, human, and fragments thereof including antibodies altered by any means to be less immunogenic in humans. Thus, for example, the monoclonal antibodies and fragments, etc., herein include âchimericâ antibodies and âhumanizedâ antibodies. In general, chimeric antibodies include a portion of the heavy and/or light chain that is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567); Morrison et al. <i>Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. </i>81:6851-6855 (1984). For example in some embodiments, a chimeric antibody contains variable regions derived from a mouse and constant regions derived from human in which the constant region contains sequences homologous to both human IgG2 and human IgG4. Numerous methods for preparing âchimericâ antibodies, etc., are known in the art. âHumanizedâ forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies or fragments are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fabâ², F(abâ²)<sub>2 </sub>or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include, grafted antibodies or CDR grafted antibodies wherein part or all of the amino acid sequence of one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) derived from a non-human animal antibody is grafted to an appropriate position of a human antibody while maintaining the desired binding specificity and/or affinity of the original non-human antibody. In some embodiments, corresponding non-human residues replace Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin. In some embodiments, humanized antibodies comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and optimize antibody performance. In some embodiments, the humanized antibody comprises substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. For further details, see, e.g.: Jones et al., <i>Nature </i>321: 522-525 (1986); Reichmann et al., <i>Nature </i>332: 323-329 (1988) and Presta, <i>Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. </i>2: 593-596 (1992). Numerous methods for âhumanizingâ antibodies, etc., are known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">The term âvectorâ or âexpression vectorâ is used herein to mean vectors used as suitable vehicles for introducing (or otherwise providing to) into and/or expressing a desired gene in a host cell. Examples of vectors include but are not limited to plasmids, phages, viruses and retroviruses. In some embodiments, suitable vectors comprise a selection marker. In some embodiments, suitable vectors comprise restriction sites to facilitate cloning of the desired gene and in some embodiments, suitable vectors comprise the ability to enter and/or replicate in eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Numerous expression vector systems are optionally utilized in a method disclosed herein. For example, one class of vector utilizes DNA elements that are derived from animal viruses such as bovine papilloma virus, polyoma virus, adenovirus, vaccinia virus, baculovirus, retroviruses (RSV, MMTV or MOMLV) or SV40 virus. Others involve the use of polycistronic systems with internal ribosome binding sites. In some embodiments, cells that have integrated exogenous DNA into their chromosomes are selected by introducing (or otherwise providing to) one or more selection markers into the transfected host cells. In some embodiments, the selection markers provide for prototrophy to an auxotrophic host, biocide resistance (e.g., antibiotics) or resistance to heavy metals such as copper. In some embodiments, the selectable marker gene is either directly linked to the DNA sequences to be expressed, or is introduced into the same cell by cotransformation. In some embodiments, additional regulatory elements are incorporated in the vector for optimal transcription. Examples of regulatory elements include signal sequences, splice signals, as well as transcriptional promoters, enhancers, and termination signals.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">In some embodiments, the nucleic acids described herein include a promoter comprising a tetracycline response element and a transgene that constitutively expresses either rtTA (reverse tetracycline transactivator) or tTA (tetracycline-controlled transactivator). The rtTA protein binds to a TRE and activates transcription only in the presence of tetracycline, doxycycline or an analogue thereof. The tTA protein, in the presence of tetracycline, doxycycline or an analogue thereof, binds to a TRE thereby inhibiting transcription. In the absence of tetracycline, doxycycline or an analogue thereof tTA allows transcription.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The term âepitopeâ refers to a fragment of a polypeptide or protein having antigenic or immunogenic activity in an organism, preferably in a mammal, and most preferably in a human. An epitope having immunogenic activity is a fragment of a polypeptide or protein that elicits an antibody response in an animal. An epitope having antigenic activity is a fragment of a polypeptide or protein to which an antibody immunospecifically binds as determined by any known method, for example by immunoassays. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">The phrase âspecifically bindsâ when referring to the interaction between an antibody or other binding molecule and a protein or polypeptide or epitope, typically refers to an antibody or other binding molecule that recognizes and detectably binds with high affinity to the target of interest. Preferably, under designated or physiological conditions, the specified antibodies or binding molecules bind to a particular polypeptide, protein or epitope yet does not bind in a significant or undesirable amount to other molecules present in a sample. In other words the specified antibody or binding molecule does not undesirably cross-react with non-target antigens and/or epitopes. A variety of immunoassay formats are used to select antibodies or other binding molecule that are immunoreactive with a particular polypeptide and have a desired specificity. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays, BIAcore, flow cytometry and radioimmunoassays are used to select monoclonal antibodies having a desired immunoreactivity and specificity. See, Harlow, 1988, A<smallcaps>NTIBODIES</smallcaps>, A L<smallcaps>ABORATORY </smallcaps>M<smallcaps>ANUAL</smallcaps>, Cold Spring Harbor Publications, New York (hereinafter, âHarlowâ), for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that are used to determine or assess immunoreactivity and specificity.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">âSelective bindingâ, âselectivityâ, and the like refer the preference of an antibody to interact with one molecule as compared to another. Preferably, interactions between antibodies, particularly modulators, and proteins are both specific and selective. Note that in some embodiments, an antibody is designed to âspecifically bindâ and âselectively bindâ two distinct, yet similar targets without binding to other undesirable targets.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The term âendogenousâ in the context of a cellular protein refers to protein naturally occurring and/or expressed by the cell in the absence of recombinant manipulation; accordingly, the terms âendogenously expressed proteinâ or âendogenous proteinâ excludes cellular proteins expressed by means of recombinant technology.</p>

Unless specifically limited otherwise, the term also refers to oligonucleotide analogs including PNA (peptidonucleic acid), analogs of DNA used in antisense technology (phosphorothioates, phosphoroamidates, and the like). Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (including but not limited to, degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions are achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 19:5081 (1991); Ohtsuka et al., J.

      <p id="p-00301-en" num="0294">In some embodiments, a TAT-MYC fusion peptide disclosed herein is constructed by any suitable method. In some embodiments, a nucleotide sequence encoding a TAT-MYC fusion peptide is generated by PCR. In some embodiments, a forward primer for a human MYC sequence comprises an in frame N-terminal 9-amino-acid sequence of the TAT protein transduction domain (i.e., RKKRRQRRR; (SEQ ID NO. 5)). In some embodiments, a reverse primer for a human MYC sequence is designed to remove the stop codon. In some embodiments, the PCR product is cloned into any suitable expression vector (hereinafter, p-TAT-MYC). In some embodiments, the expression vector comprises a polyhistidine tag and a V5 tag.</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="2">Recombinant Polypeptides</heading>
      <p id="p-00302-en" num="0295">Described herein are certain recombinant polypeptides. In certain instances, antibodies comprise light and a heavy polypeptide chains. In some embodiments, DNA sequences that encode the light and the heavy chains of the antibody are made, either simultaneously or separately, using reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase in accordance with suitable methods. In some embodiments, PCR is initiated by consensus constant region primers or by more specific primers based on the published heavy and light chain DNA and amino acid sequences. As discussed above, in some embodiments, PCR is also used to isolate DNA clones encoding the antibody light and heavy chains. In some embodiments, the libraries are screened by consensus primers or larger homologous probes, such as mouse constant region probes.</p>
      <p id="p-00303-en" num="0296">In some embodiments, DNA, e.g., plasmid DNA, is isolated from the cell (e.g., a mammalian cell) by any suitable method, restriction mapped and sequenced in accordance with any suitable techniques set forth in detail, e.g., in the foregoing references relating to recombinant DNA techniques. In some embodiments, the DNA is synthetic at any point during the isolation process or subsequent analysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00304-en" num="0297">In some embodiments, following manipulation of the isolated genetic material to provide antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments, variants, or derivatives thereof, the polynucleotides encoding the antibodies are inserted in an expression vector for introduction into host cells which are therein used to produce the desired quantity of antibody.</p>
      <p id="p-00305-en" num="0298">In certain embodiments, recombinant expression of an antibody, or fragment, derivative or analog thereof, e.g., a heavy or light chain of an antibody that binds to a target molecule utilizes construction of an expression vector containing a nucleic acid that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule or a heavy or light chain of an antibody, or portion thereof (preferably containing the heavy or light chain variable domain), is obtained, the vector for the production of the antibody molecule is in some embodiments, produced by recombinant DNA technology using any suitable techniques. Thus, processes for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. In some embodiments, processes any suitable manner of construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences comprising appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals is utilized in the a method disclosed herein. These processes include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. Thus, in some embodiments, provided herein are replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule, or a heavy or light chain thereof, or a heavy or light chain variable domain, operably linked to a promoter. In some embodiments, vectors comprise the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody and the variable domain of the antibody is incorporated into the vector for expression of the entire heavy or light chain.</p>
      <p id="p-00306-en" num="0299">In some embodiments, the cloned variable region genes are inserted into an expression vector along with the heavy and light chain constant region genes synthesized as discussed above. In some embodiments, an expression vector that is capable of eliciting expression in eukaryotic cells is used. Examples of suitable vectors include, but are not limited to plasmids pcDNA3, pHCMV/Zeo, pCR3.1, pEF1/His, pIND/GS, pRc/HCMV2, pSV40/Zeo2, pTRACER-HCMV, pUB6/V5-His, pVAX1, and pZeoSV2 (available from Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.), and plasmid pCI (available from Promega, Madison, Wis.). In certain instances, screening large numbers of transformed cells for those that express suitably high levels of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains is accomplished by any suitable method, for example, by robotic systems.</p>
      <p id="p-00307-en" num="0300">In some embodiments, once the vector or DNA sequence encoding an antibody is prepared, the expression vector is introduced into an appropriate host cell as disclosed herein. Introduction of the plasmid into the host cell is accomplished by any suitable method. These include, but are not limited to, transfection (including electroporation), protoplast fusion, calcium phosphate precipitation, cell fusion with enveloped DNA, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, microinjection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, transduction, scrape loading, ballistic introduction and infection with intact virus. See, e.g., Ridgway (1988) âMammalian Expression Vectorsâ in Vectors, ed. Rodriguez and Denhardt (Butterworths, Boston, Mass.), Chapter 24.2, pp. 470-472; Sambrook et al. (1989) <i>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual</i>, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. In certain instances, host cells harboring the expression construct are grown under conditions appropriate to the production of the light chains and heavy chains, and assayed for heavy and/or light chain protein synthesis. Exemplary assay techniques include ELISA, radioimmunoassay (RIA), or fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (FACS), immunohistochemistry and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00308-en" num="0301">As disclosed herein, introducing (or otherwise providing to) nucleic acids and/or vectors into host organisms are achieved by any suitable method. Examples of such processes include but are not limited to gene gun techniques, naked DNA immunization, the development of transgenic or transchromosomal organisms, lentiviral mediated production of transgenic organisms, vaccinia viruses transduction and adenovirus.</p>
      <p id="p-00309-en" num="0302">As disclosed herein, introducing (or otherwise providing to) antigens into organisms or cells comprises any manner suitable. Some examples of such processes include but are not limited to the use of Tat fusion peptides, various immunization protocols, infection by virus, and introduction of whole cells expressing antigen.</p>
      <p id="p-00310-en" num="0303">In some embodiments, an expression vector is transferred to a host cell by any suitable method, and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques or techniques disclosed herein to produce an antibody for use in the methods described herein. Thus, provided in certain embodiments, herein are host cells that contain a polynucleotide encoding an antibody, or a heavy or light chain thereof, operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In some embodiments, for the expression of double-chained antibodies, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains are used to express of the entire immunoglobulin molecule.</p>
      <p id="p-00311-en" num="0304">In some embodiments, a number of selection systems are used including, but not limited to, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al.

      <p id="p-00312-en" num="0305">In some embodiments, the expression level of an antibody molecule is increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel (1987) âThe Use of Vectors Based on Gene Amplification for the Expression of Cloned Genes in Mammalian Cells in DNA Cloningâ (Academic Press, NY) Vol. 3. When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable, an increase in the level of inhibitor present in the culture of the host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse et al. (1983) <i>Mol. Cell. Biol. </i>3:257).</p>

      <heading id="h-00018-en" level="2">Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Administration</heading>
      <p id="p-00332-en" num="0327">In certain embodiments, provided herein, are pharmaceutical compositions comprising an antibody and one or more physiologically acceptable carriers. Physiologically acceptable carriers include excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active agents into preparations which are used pharmaceutically. In certain instances, proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. A summary of pharmaceutical compositions is found, for example, in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Nineteenth Ed (Easton, Pa.: Mack Publishing Company, 1995); Hoover, John E., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. 1975; Liberman, H. A. and Lachman, L., Eds., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Decker, New York, N.Y., 1980; and Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Seventh Ed. (Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 1999).</p>
      <p id="p-00333-en" num="0328">Provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions that include an antibody and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent(s), excipient(s), or carrier(s). In addition, an antibody is optionally administered as pharmaceutical compositions in which they are mixed with other active ingredients, as in combination therapy. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions includes other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, such as preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure, and/or buffers. In addition, the pharmaceutical compositions also contain other therapeutically valuable substances.</p>
      <p id="p-00334-en" num="0329">A pharmaceutical composition refers to a mixture of an antibody with other chemical components, such as carriers, stabilizers, diluents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, and/or excipients. The pharmaceutical composition facilitates administration of an antibody to an organism. In practicing the methods of treatment or use provided herein, therapeutically effective amounts of an antibody are administered in a pharmaceutical composition to an organism (e.g., a mammal) having a condition, disease, or disorder to be treated. Preferably, the organism (e.g., a mammal) is a human. A therapeutically effective amount varies depending on the severity and stage of the condition, the age and relative health of the subject, the potency of the antibody used and other factors. Antibodies are optionally used singly or in combination with one or more therapeutic agents as components of mixtures.</p>
      <p id="p-00335-en" num="0330">The pharmaceutical formulations described herein are optionally administered to a subject by multiple administration routes, including but not limited to, oral, parenteral (e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular), intranasal, buccal, topical, rectal, or transdermal administration routes. The pharmaceutical formulations described herein include, but are not limited to, aqueous liquid dispersions, self-emulsifying dispersions, solid solutions, liposomal dispersions, aerosols, solid dosage forms, powders, immediate release formulations, controlled release formulations, fast melt formulations, tablets, capsules, pills, delayed release formulations, extended release formulations, pulsatile release formulations, multiparticulate formulations, and mixed immediate and controlled release formulations.</p>
      <heading id="h-00019-en" level="2">Methods of Dosing and Treatment Regimens</heading>
      <p id="p-00336-en" num="0331">An antibody is optionally used in the preparation of medicaments for the prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of inflammatory conditions or conditions that would benefit, at least in part, from amelioration. In addition, a method for treating any of the diseases or conditions described herein in a subject in need of such treatment, involves administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing an antibody as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutically acceptable N-oxide, pharmaceutically active metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug, or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, in therapeutically effective amounts to said subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00337-en" num="0332">Furthermore, in some embodiments, provided herein is a method of treating a disorder mediated by an antigen by administering a therapeutically effective antibody that binds or specifically binds to the selected antigen to an individual in need thereof. Exemplary antigens are set forth herein and include, by way of non-limiting example, viral antigens (e.g., HIV antigens, influenza antigens, SARS antigens), autoantigens, tumor antigens, various pathogen related antigens and the like. Likewise, disorders mediated by the selected antigen include any disorder so mediated, including, by way of non-limiting example, viral infections and syndromes caused thereby (e.g., HIV, influenza, and SARS), as well as pathogenic and parasitic infections and syndromes caused thereby.</p>
      <p id="p-00338-en" num="0333">In certain instances wherein the patient's condition does not improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of an antibody is optionally administered chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout the duration of the patient's life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient's disease or condition.</p>
      <p id="p-00339-en" num="0334">In the case wherein the patient's status does improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of an antibody is optionally given continuously; alternatively, the dose of drug being administered is temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a âdrug holidayâ). The length of the drug holiday optionally varies between 2 days and 1 year, including by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 12 days, 15 days, 20 days, 28 days, 35 days, 50 days, 70 days, 100 days, 120 days, 150 days, 180 days, 200 days, 250 days, 280 days, 300 days, 320 days, 350 days, or 365 days. The dose reduction during a drug holiday includes from 10%-100%, including, by way of example only, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 100%.</p>
      <p id="p-00340-en" num="0335">Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, is reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. In some embodiments, patients require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.</p>
      <p id="p-00341-en" num="0336">In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition described herein is in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form, the formulation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of an antibody. In some embodiments, the unit dosage is in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non-limiting examples are packaged tablets or capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. In some embodiments, aqueous suspension compositions are packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers. Alternatively, multiple-dose reclosable containers are used, in which case it is typical to include a preservative in the composition. By way of example only, formulations for parenteral injection are presented in unit dosage form, which include, but are not limited to ampoules, or in multi dose containers, with an added preservative.</p>
      <p id="p-00342-en" num="0337">The daily dosages appropriate for an antibody are from about 0.01 to 2.5 mg/kg per body weight. An indicated daily dosage in the larger organism (e.g., a mammal), including, but not limited to, humans, is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 100 mg, conveniently administered in divided doses, including, but not limited to, up to four times a day or in extended release form. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration include from about 1 to 50 mg active ingredient. The foregoing ranges are merely suggestive, as the number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime is large, and considerable excursions from these recommended values are not uncommon. Such dosages are optionally altered depending on a number of variables, not limited to the activity of the antibody used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner.</p>
      <p id="p-00343-en" num="0338">Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens are optionally determined in cell cultures or experimental organisms, including, but not limited to, the determination of the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, which is expressed as the ratio between LD50 and ED50. An antibody exhibiting high therapeutic indices is preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies are optionally used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such an antibody lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with minimal toxicity. The dosage optionally varies within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.</p>
      <heading id="h-00020-en" level="2">Combination Treatments</heading>
      <p id="p-00344-en" num="0339">Antibody compositions described herein are also optionally used in combination with other therapeutic reagents that are selected for their therapeutic value for the condition to be treated. In general, the compositions described herein and, in embodiments, where combinational therapy is employed, other agents do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, are optionally administered by different routes. The initial administration is optionally made according to established protocols, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration subsequently modified.</p>
      <p id="p-00345-en" num="0340">In certain instances, it is appropriate to administer an antibody composition as described herein in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving an antibody composition as described herein is nausea, then it is appropriate to administer an anti-nausea agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of an antibody are enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant has minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit experienced by a patient is increased by administering an antibody with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient is either simply additive of the two therapeutic agents or the patient experiences a synergistic benefit.</p>
      <p id="p-00346-en" num="0341">Therapeutically-effective dosages vary when the drugs are used in treatment combinations. Methods for experimentally determining therapeutically-effective dosages of drugs and other agents for use in combination treatment regimens are documented methodologies. One example of such a method is the use of metronomic dosing, i.e., providing more frequent, lower doses in order to minimize toxic side effects. Combination treatment further includes periodic treatments that start and stop at various times to assist with the clinical management of the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00347-en" num="0342">In any case, the multiple therapeutic agents (one of which is an antibody as described herein) are administered in any order, or even simultaneously. If simultaneously, the multiple therapeutic agents are optionally provided in a single, unified form, or in multiple forms (by way of example only, either as a single pill or as two separate pills). In some embodiments, one of the therapeutic agents is given in multiple doses, or both are given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the multiple doses optionally varies from more than zero weeks to less than four weeks. In addition, the combination methods, compositions and formulations are not to be limited to the use of only two agents; the use of multiple therapeutic combinations is also envisioned.</p>
      <p id="p-00348-en" num="0343">It is understood that the dosage regimen to treat, prevent, or ameliorate the condition(s) for which relief is sought, is optionally modified in accordance with a variety of factors. These factors include the disorder from which the subject suffers, as well as the age, weight, sex, diet, and medical condition of the subject. Thus, the dosage regimen actually employed varies widely, in some embodiments, and therefore deviates from the dosage regimens set forth herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00349-en" num="0344">The pharmaceutical agents which make up the combination therapy disclosed herein are optionally a combined dosage form or in separate dosage forms intended for substantially simultaneous administration. The pharmaceutical agents that make up the combination therapy are optionally also be administered sequentially, with either therapeutic agent being administered by a regimen calling for two-step administration. The two-step administration regimen optionally calls for sequential administration of the active agents or spaced-apart administration of the separate active agents. The time period between the multiple administration steps ranges from, a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the properties of each pharmaceutical agent, such as potency, solubility, bioavailability, plasma half-life and kinetic profile of the pharmaceutical agent. Circadian variation of the target molecule concentrations are optionally used to determine the optimal dose interval.</p>
      <p id="p-00350-en" num="0345">In addition, an antibody is optionally used in combination with procedures that provide additional or synergistic benefit to the patient. By way of example only, patients are expected to find therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit in the methods described herein, wherein pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody and/or combinations with other therapeutics are combined with genetic testing to determine whether that individual is a carrier of a mutant gene that is correlated with certain diseases or conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00351-en" num="0346">An antibody and the additional therapy(ies) are optionally administered before, during or after the occurrence of a disease or condition, and the timing of administering the composition containing an antibody varies in some embodiments. Thus, for example, an antibody is used as a prophylactic and is administered continuously to subjects with a propensity to develop conditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease or condition. An antibody and compositions are optionally administered to a subject during or as soon as possible after the onset of the symptoms. The administration of the agents are optionally initiated within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, preferably within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, more preferably within the first 6 hours of the onset of the symptoms, and most preferably within 3 hours of the onset of the symptoms. The initial administration is optionally via any route practical, such as, for example, an intravenous injection, a bolus injection, infusion over 5 minutes to about 5 hours, a pill, a capsule, transdermal patch, buccal delivery, and the like, or combination thereof. An antibody is preferably administered as soon as is practicable after the onset of a disease or condition is detected or suspected, and for a length of time necessary for the treatment of the disease, such as, for example, from about 1 month to about 3 months. The length of treatment optionally varies for each subject, and the length is then determined using the known criteria. For example, an antibody or a formulation containing an antibody are administered for at least 2 weeks, preferably about 1 month to about 5 years, and more preferably from about 1 month to about 3 years.</p>

      <p id="p-00353-en" num="0348">The following example demonstrates the production of B-cell lines derived from MMTV-tTA/TRE-MYC mice.</p>
      <p id="p-00354-en" num="0349">MMTV-tTA/TRE-MYC mice are maintained on doxycycline for eight weeks after birth and then are switched to a normal diet. The mice develop an externally evident lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, and present with a number of the clinical signs that are consistently seen associated with lymphoid neoplasia (scruffy fur, hunched posture, labored breathing, anemia, organomegaly, etc.). The mice are euthanized and their lymph nodes and spleens are collected for analysis. Single cell suspensions are generated from some of the lymph nodes and a portion of the spleen. Those cells are used for flow cytometric analyses. The initial characterization of the tumors demonstrated the high prevalence of activated B-cells. Some of the same cells are used to seed cultures to generate B-cell lines. These cells are cultured in lymphocyte media (RPMI 1640, 10% Fetal Calf Serum, penicillin/streptomycin, L-glutamine, HEPES, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate and 2-(3-mercaptoethanol). Approximately 14-21 days later, some of the wells began to exhibit clonal outgrowth of cell lines. The cells are carefully expanded until they were adapted to growth in large flasks. A portion of the cells are cryopreserved in 10% DMSO.</p>
      <p id="p-00355-en" num="0350">Two cell lines were initially picked, designated TBLK6 and TBLK7. These cell lines exhibited different surface expression levels of CD138. The levels of immunoglobulin secretion into the tissue culture medium is measured after seeding. Both cell lines spontaneously secreted immunoglobulin into the growth medium. The levels of secretion are increased by the addition of IL-4 and IL-6 into the initial innoculum Immunoglobulins secreted by both TBLK6 and TBLK7 are shown to be IgM. In some embodiments, single cells are cloned from both cell lines in order to generate true monoclonal populations. A number of MMTV-tTA/TRE-MYC bigenic mice are generated that, in some embodiments, are used for isolating the AN1/T3 population by cell sorting.</p>
      <heading id="h-00023-en" level="1">Example 2</heading>
      <p id="p-00356-en" num="0351">The following example demonstrates that antibodies produced in Myc-over-expressing mice function in vivo.</p>
      <p id="p-00357-en" num="0352">A model of lethal viral infection is used. Porcine Rabies Virus (PRV) is a member of the alpha-herpes viruses that has been previously shown to be lethal in mice following intravenous administration. Two variants of PRV are constructed. In one instance, one of the sequences for a gene called US-9 was fused to GFP. This construct allowed for tracking of the virus and virally infected cells in a different setting. US-9 protein expression is confirmed and US-9 retained its function as the fusion protein. The virus is fully pathogenic in spite of its additional genetic cargo. A variant of PRV that encodes the open reading frame for HEL is also generated. This viral variant is shown to express HEL by Western blot analysis of infected cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00358-en" num="0353">GFP-expressing virus or the HEL-expressing virus innocula are incubated with HEL-specific antibodies diluted 1:500 for one hour, on ice. The mixtures are then injected intravenously into groups of four mice. The mice are then monitored for four days following administration of the virus and antibody mixtures.</p>
      <p id="p-00359-en" num="0354">As shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the GFP-expressing virus is not affected by the presence of HEL-specific antibodies. The kinetics of mortality in that group is comparable with our previous experience with wild type PRV strains. In contrast, the kinetics of mortality in mice that received the HEL-expressing virus is significantly delayed and that group of mice lived for almost twice as long as the mice injected with the GFP-expressing virus. The viruses used for these experiments only expressed the US-9 fusion protein transiently. After entry into cells, they produce wild type PRV.</p>
      <heading id="h-00024-en" level="1">Example 3</heading>
      <p id="p-00360-en" num="0355">In this example, Myc-ER is used for the conditional immortalization of long term hematopoietic stem cells. A group of bone marrow chimeric mice are generated using 5FU enriched bone marrow derived stem cells, as follows. For bone marrow derived hematopoietic stem cells, 5 mg/mouse of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) is administered intravenously, in order to enrich for long-term hematopoietic stem cells, and induce HSC proliferation in vivo. The bone marrow cells are collected from the femurs and tibia bones 5 days later. The red blood cells are lysed, using a hypotonic lysis buffer. The remaining cells are washed twice in media and plated at a concentration of 2Ã10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml, in a 24 well plate, in DMEM media supplemented with 15% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, L-glutamine, Non-essential amino acids, recombinant human IL-3, IL-6 and Stem Cell Factor (SCF). The cells are cultured for 24 hours prior to the first spin infection, and are subject to the infection procedure 3 times, every 24 hours. A day after the last spin infection, the cells are analyzed by flow cytometry. Lentivirally transduced bone marrow derived hematopoietic stem cells are reconstituted to lethally irradiated mice, and are checked for GFP expression in lymphoid organs 12 weeks later. In this instance, hematopoietic stem cells are allowed to reconstitute a normal peripheral lymphoid compartment for 8-12 weeks after bone marrow transplantation. The splenic, GFP+ AN-1/T3 cells are isolated from those mice and are used for in vitro immortalization protocols, as described above. The key difference is that instead of withdrawing doxycycline from the system, 10 nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) is added to the medium. In some embodiments, sorted, GFP+ AN-1/T3 cells are adoptively transferred into cohorts of wild type recipient mice that are treated once weekly with 1 mg/mouse of 4OHT, intraperitoneally. The mice are monitored daily for the appearance of clinical signs associated with the development of B-cell lymphomas. The resulting tumors are collected and used for generating B-cell lines as described herein, using 4OHT instead of doxycycline as the regulator of Myc function.</p>

      <p id="p-00361-en" num="0356">In this example, Myc-ER and Bcl-2 are used for the conditional immortalization of long term hematopoietic stem cells. A group of bone marrow chimeric mice are generated using 5FU enriched bone marrow derived stem cells, as follows. For bone marrow derived hematopoietic stem cells, 5 mg/mouse of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) is administered intravenously, in order to enrich for long-term hematopoietic stem cells, and induce HSC proliferation in vivo.

      <heading id="h-00026-en" level="1">Example 5</heading>
      <p id="p-00362-en" num="0357">In order to test the notion of harnessing the MMTV-tTA/TRE-MYC mice to generate novel antibodies to antigens of interest through the introduction into the system as neo-self antigens, a retroviral bone marrow chimeric mice was used. A variant of pMIG that encodes the cDNA for H5 hemagglutinin from a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, A/Ty/Ont/7732/66 (H5N9) was first generated. HSCs enriched from the bone marrows of mice that had been treated with 5-fluorouracil 5 days prior to collection, were then obtained as previously described. The donor cells were obtained from TRE-MYC mice. The cells were transduced with one retrovirus that encodes the tetracycline transactivator protein (tTA) as well as pMIG-H5. The transduced bone marrow HSCs were used to reconstitute lethally irradiated mice. The bone marrow chimeric mice were maintained on SEPTRA and observed daily for externally evident clinical signs of hematological malignancies (scruffy fur, labored breathing, externally evident lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, hunched posture, dehydration, and hind limb paralysis). A cohort of 5 mice presented with clinical signs of hematological malignancies in a 7-day period, starting 6 weeks after transplantation. The lymph nodes and spleens were collected from euthanized mice and used to generate single cell suspensions. The remaining cells were either cultured to begin to generate cell lines, or cryopreserved for subsequent analysis. A small fraction of the cells were stained for cell surface markers and analyzed by flow cytometry (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>). <figref>FIG. 8</figref> shows the surface profile of the cells isolated from the bone marrow chimeric mice that had developed a hematological malignancy. These are uniformly B220+/IgM+, suggesting that the mice had developed a B-cell leukemia/lymphoma composed of mature B-cells. These cells were placed in culture and clonally expanded populations were passed starting 8 days after initial seeding. This is a significantly faster timeline than what is normally achieved with current approaches to monoclonal antibody production. In addition, the accelerated time frame by which this novel approach has allowed us to generate novel antibodies to hemagglutinin should render this approach as a rapid response platform for the development of novel neutralizing antibodies to new and emerging infectious diseases and other biological threats.</p>
      <p id="p-00363-en" num="0358">The serum from these mice was collected to test for the presence of antibodies to H5 Immunoblot analysis with the serum from these mice showed specific reactivity to the HA1 subunit of the H5 HA (<figref>FIG. 9</figref>). Cell lysates were obtained from 293FT cells that had been transiently transfected with two different expression plasmids encoding H5 (pCDNA3-H5 and pMIG-H5). The blots were probed with sera obtained from leukemic mice. The banding pattern that developed was consistent with H5 and the cleavage products that develop during the normal maturation and processing of HA in a cell. The mature HA is composed of two subunits the HA1 and the HA2. The HA1 subunit (Ë40 kDa) forms the globular head of the molecule and is responsible for binding to the host cell sialic acid receptors on surface glycoproteins and glycolipids.</p>
      <p id="p-00364-en" num="0359">The HA2 (Ë20 kDa) subunit is responsible for fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membranes of the host cell during entry. A protease cleavage site separates these two subunits and cleavage by host protease is required for entry into the host cell. The vast majority of virus neutralizing epitopes are found in the HA1 subunit 22 and inhibit virus-receptor interaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00365-en" num="0360">Heamagglutination inhibition analysis of mouse serum obtained from retroviral chimeric mice was performed to test the ability of the sera to block virus-receptor interaction with a variety influenza A isolates including H5N2, H1N1, H7N2, H3N2, and H6N8 subtypes (<figref>FIG. 10</figref>).</p>
