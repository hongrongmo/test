      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The invention relates generally to laser assisted ophthalmic surgery, and more particularly to methods and devices using one or more lasers in performing a capsulorrhexis.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Cataracts are a common cause of poor vision and are the leading cause of blindness. There are at least 100M eyes with cataracts causing visual acuity of less that 6/60 in meters (or 20/200 in feet). Cataract extraction is the most commonly performed surgical procedure in the world with estimates of over 22 million cases worldwide and over 3 million cases being performed annually in North America. Generally, there are two types of cataract surgery: small incision cataract surgery with phacoemulsification, and extra-capsular cataract extraction.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In small incision cataract surgery with phacoemulsification, the more common approach, about a 2 millimeter (mm) incision is made in the cornea and the opacified natural lens is removed with irrigation, aspiration, and phacoemulsification while leaving the elastic lens capsule intact to allow implantation and retention of an intraocular lens (IOL). Currently, extra-capsular cataract extraction surgery is a more invasive procedure and is performed in the developing countries where there are fewer resources. In this procedure a large incision of 6 mm or more is made in the sclera, and the complete opacified natural lens is removed.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">One of the more critical components of both of these surgical procedures is the capsulorrhexis, which is the incision in the lens capsule made to permit removal of the lens nucleus and cortex. The lens capsule is a transparent, homogeneous basement membrane that comprises collagen. It has elastic properties without being composed of elastic fibers. The capsule has a smooth surface contour except at its equator where zonules attach.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Typically the capsulorrhexis creates a symmetric circular incision, centered about the visual axis and sized appropriately for the IOL and the patient's condition. The mechanical integrity around the newly formed incision edge needs to be sufficient to withstand the forces experienced during cataract extraction and IOL implantation. Postoperatively, the newly formed capsule rim hardens and the opening contracts, providing further strength and structural support for the IOL to prevent dislocation and misalignment.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The current standard of care for capsulorrhexis is Continuous Curvilinear Capsulorrhexis (CCC). The concept of CCC is to provide a smooth continuous circular opening through the anterior lens capsule for phacoemulsification and insertion of the intraocular lens, minimizing the risk of complications including errant tears and extensions. Currently, the capsulorrhexis is performed manually utilizing forceps or a needle. This technique depends on applying a shear force and minimizing in-plane stretching forces to manually tear the incision. One complication that may develop when performing a capsulorrhexis in this manner is an errant tear. Errant tears are radial rips and extensions of the capsulorrhexis towards the capsule equator. If an errant tear encounters a zonular attachment the tear may be directed out to the capsular fornix and possibly through to the posterior of the capsule. Posterior capsule tears facilitate the nucleus being âdroppedâ into the posterior chamber, resulting in further complications.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Further problems that may develop in capsulorrhexis are related to inability of the surgeon to adequately visualize the capsule due to lack of red reflex (reddish reflection of light from the retina), to grasp it with sufficient security, or to tear a smooth symmetric circular opening of the appropriate size. Additional difficulties may relate to maintenance of the anterior chamber depth after initial opening, small size of the pupil, or the absence of a red reflex due to the lens opacity. Additional complications arise in older patients with weak zonules and very young children that have very soft and elastic capsules, which are very difficult to mechanically rupture.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Following cataract surgery there is a rapid 1-2 day response where the capsule hardens and capsule contraction starts. This contraction continues over a 4-6 week period where fibrosis of the capsulorrhexis and IOL optic interface and of the IOL haptic and capsule interfaces also occurs. Even beyond one year the capsule continues to contract to a lesser degree. Thus positioning the capsulorrhexis is a critical factor in the long-term success.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Accordingly, there is a need in the art to provide new ophthalmic methods, techniques and devices to advance the standard of care for capsulorrhexis.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">This specification discloses laser assisted ophthalmic surgery methods and devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In one aspect, a device for creating an opening in the anterior lens capsule of the eye comprises a scanning treatment laser beam having a programmed scan profile for a predetermined treatment pattern that forms a closed curve at the anterior lens capsule. The treatment laser has a wavelength selected to be strongly absorbed at the anterior lens capsule and a power selected to cause thermal denaturing of collagen in the anterior lens capsule resulting in thermal tissue separation along the closed curve without ablating anterior lens capsule tissue. The device also comprises a scanning visualization laser beam having a programmed scan profile for a predetermined visualization pattern at the anterior lens capsule and a wavelength in the visible spectrum.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The visualization pattern differs from the treatment pattern in size and geometry. At least a portion of the visualization pattern may, for example, indicate desired boundaries of the opening to be created in the anterior lens capsule and thereby facilitate aligning the treatment pattern on the anterior lens capsule. Typically, the desired boundaries of the opening differ in location from the closed curve of the treatment pattern as a result of contraction of anterior lens capsule tissue adjacent to the closed curve during and after thermal tissue separation. Alternatively, or in addition, at least a portion of the visualization pattern may correspond to one or more anatomical features of the eye, and thereby facilitate aligning the treatment pattern with respect to those anatomical features.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In another aspect, a device for creating an opening in the anterior lens capsule of the eye comprises a treatment laser beam and a two-dimensional scanner on which the treatment laser beam is incident. The scanner has a programmed scan profile for a predetermined treatment pattern in which the treatment laser beam is scanned to form a closed curve at the anterior lens capsule. The device comprises a lens positioned to focus the treatment laser beam to a waist at the anterior lens capsule, with the treatment beam expanding from its waist to be defocused on the retina of the eye. The treatment pattern passes through a treatment pattern invariant and/or a treatment pattern waist between the lens and the eye. The treatment laser beam has a wavelength selected to be strongly absorbed at the anterior lens capsule and a power selected to cause thermal denaturing of collagen in the anterior lens capsule resulting in thermal tissue separation along the closed curve of the treatment pattern without ablating anterior lens capsule tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The treatment pattern may diverge in the eye and consequently be expanded in size and area on the retina compared to its size and area at the anterior lens capsule. As a result, the treatment pattern may avoid the fovea on the retina.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In another aspect, a device for creating an opening in the anterior lens capsule of the eye comprises a continuous wave scanning treatment laser beam having a programmed scan profile for a predetermined treatment pattern forming a closed curve at the anterior lens capsule in a single pass. The treatment laser has a wavelength selected to be strongly absorbed at the anterior lens capsule, and a power selected to cause thermal denaturing of collagen in the anterior lens capsule resulting in thermal tissue separation along the closed curve without ablating anterior lens capsule tissue. At the beginning of the treatment pattern the power of the treatment laser ramps up from about zero to about 90% of its full power during a period of about 5 milliseconds to about 200 milliseconds. This ramp-up may minimize the likelihood of the capsule tearing at the starting point of the treatment pattern by allowing the tissue near the starting point of the pattern to initially stretch without separating, thereby reducing the shear stress/tension at the start of the pattern, and/or by avoiding or minimizing local shock waves in the fluid adjacent to the target tissue that might otherwise be generated by the growth and collapse of one or more vapor bubbles accompanying a faster thermal turn-on.</p>

The device also comprises a first visible light visualization laser beam sharing an optical path with the treatment laser beam, and a second visible light visualization laser beam intersecting the first visualization laser beam at or approximately at the waist of the treatment laser beam.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The first visualization laser beam and the second visualization laser beam may be produced, for example, from a single visible light laser beam incident on the scanner by dithering the scanner between the optical path of the first visualization laser beam and the optical path of the second visualization laser beam.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The following detailed description should be read with reference to the drawings, in which identical reference numbers refer to like elements throughout the different figures. The drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, depict selective embodiments and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. The detailed description illustrates by way of example, not by way of limitation, the principles of the invention. This description will clearly enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and describes several embodiments, adaptations, variations, alternatives and uses of the invention, including what is presently believed to be the best mode of carrying out the invention. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms âa,â âan,â and âtheâ include plural referents unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">As described in more detail below, this specification discloses ophthalmic surgery methods and devices that utilize one or more treatment laser beams to create a shaped opening in the anterior lens capsule of the eye when performing a capsulorrhexis procedure. In the procedure, a light absorbing agent may optionally be added onto or into the lens capsule tissue, and the treatment laser wavelength selected to be strongly absorbed by the light absorbing agent. Alternatively, the treatment laser wavelength may be selected to be absorbed or strongly absorbed by the tissue itself, in which case no additional light absorbing agent need be used. In either case, as used herein the phrase âstrongly absorbedâ is intended to mean that transmission of the treatment beam through the tissue to be treated (e.g., the anterior lens capsule) is less than about 65%, or less than about 40%. The treatment laser beam is directed at the lens capsule tissue along a predetermined closed curve to cause a thermal effect in the tissue resulting in separation of the tissue along the laser beam path. The predetermined closed curve may have, for example, a circular or elliptical shape. Any other suitable shape for the closed curve may also be used. Typically, the shape is selected to reduce the likelihood of tears developing during cataract surgery, on the edge of the separated edge of the tissue that is formed exterior to the closed curve. Visualization patterns produced with one or more target laser beams may be projected onto the lens capsule tissue to aid in the procedure.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">General aspects of these methods and devices may be better understood with reference to <figref>FIG. 1</figref> and <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows, in a transverse plane view of an eye, the intended location of an intraocular lens <b>120</b> to be implanted after a capsulorrhexis procedure. In the illustrated example, a light absorbing agent <b>130</b> is added into or onto a layer of the anterior lens capsule <b>110</b>. This agent may be a biocompatible agent (e.g. Indocyanine green or Trypan Blue), a dye, pigment, a nanoparticle, a carbon particle, or any other suitable light absorbing agent. The light absorbing agent may be Trypan Blue, other Vital Dyes, or Indocyanine Green, for example. Subsequently, a light beam <b>150</b>, e.g. a laser beam, is directed along a closed curve path on the anterior lens capsule. The directed light beam is absorbed by the light absorbing agent to deposit thermal energy in and cause a local thermal affect on the anterior lens capsule to yield a capsulorrhexis.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, generally the wavelength, power, speed of light beam movement along the closed curve, and spot size on the treated tissue are selected so that the light beam can be absorbed by the light absorbing agent to deposit sufficient thermal energy adjacent to or at the anterior lens capsule to cause a mechanical separation <b>210</b> in the anterior lens capsule. The laser beam parameters are typically selected to avoid ablation of the tissue, and the mechanical separation is believed to result instead from thermal denaturing of collagen in the tissue (in which, for example, the collagen transitions from a crystalline helical structure to an amorphous structure). The denatured collagen shrinks and contracts to form thickened rims <b>220</b>-E and <b>220</b>-<b>1</b> bordering the separation forming the capsulorrhexis. Advantageously, these rims may be more elastic and resistant to tearing than the original membrane.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">For clarity and convenience, various features and aspects of the inventive methods and devices are described below under separately labeled headings. This organization of the description is not meant to be limiting. Variations of the methods and devices described herein may include or employ any suitable combination of aspects or features described under the separate headings.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">Treatment Beam Patterns</heading>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">
        <figref>FIGS. 3A-3H</figref> illustrate an example âInterior-Closed-Curve-Interiorâ treatment pattern in which the treatment laser beam is directed along a predetermined closed curve <b>310</b>. The treatment pattern starts interior to the closed curve, progresses around the closed curve, then terminates interior to the closed curve. Although illustrated as clockwise, this pattern may also be counterclockwise. Dashed line <b>310</b> of <figref>FIG. 3A</figref> represents the complete pattern. The dot <b>320</b> in <figref>FIG. 3B</figref> indicates the start point of the pattern on the interior of the closed curve, and <figref>FIGS. 3C-3H</figref> illustrate the progression of the pattern with a solid line <b>330</b> at subsequent time intervals through the delivery of the pattern. Dot <b>340</b> in <figref>FIG. 3H</figref> indicates the end point of the treatment pattern on the interior of the closed curve. Locating the start and end points of the procedure on the interior of the closed curve (in material which will be removed from the eye) helps prevent irregularities in the shape of the curve that might promote tearing of the rim of the remaining anterior lens capsule located exterior to the closed curve.</p>

The treatment pattern starts in the interior region of the closed curve, progresses around the closed curve with a region of overlap on the closed curve, and then terminates on the closed curve. Although illustrated as clockwise, this pattern may also be counterclockwise. Dashed line <b>410</b> of <figref>FIG. 5A</figref> represents the complete pattern. The dot <b>320</b> in <figref>FIG. 5B</figref> indicates the start point of the pattern on the interior of the closed curve, and <figref>FIGS. 5C-5H</figref> illustrate the progression of the pattern with a solid line <b>330</b> at subsequent time intervals through the delivery of the pattern. Dot <b>540</b> in <figref>FIG. 5H</figref> indicates the end point of the treatment pattern on the closed curve, where the region <b>550</b> on the closed curve experiences treatment exposure of the laser near the beginning of the pattern, and again towards the later part of the pattern delivery, i.e., it is the overlap region.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 7A-7H</figref> illustrate an example âInterior-Closed-Curve-Overlap-Interiorâ treatment pattern in which the treatment laser beam is directed along a predetermined closed curve <b>710</b>. The treatment pattern starts interior to the closed curve, then progresses around the closed curve with a region of overlap on the closed curve, and then terminates on the interior of the closed curve. Although illustrated as clockwise, this pattern may also be counterclockwise. Dashed line <b>710</b> of <figref>FIG. 7A</figref> represents the complete pattern.

As shown in <figref>FIGS. 7G-7H</figref>, region <b>550</b> on the closed curve experiences treatment exposure of the laser near the beginning of the pattern, and again towards the later part of the pattern delivery, i.e., it is the overlap region. Dot <b>340</b> in <figref>FIG. 7H</figref> indicates the end point of the treatment pattern on the interior of the closed curve.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Any other suitable treatment beam patterns may also be used. One or more treatment beam pattern shapes may be preprogrammed into a laser capsulorrhexis device (described in more detail below) by the manufacturer, for example. At or prior to the time of treatment an operator may then, for example, select the size (e.g., diameter) and shape of the closed curve defining the treatment pattern, or of the desired rhexis to be produced by the closed curve of the treatment pattern.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">Visualization/Target Patterns</heading>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">As noted above, visualization patterns produced with one or more laser beams, which typically differ in wavelength from the treatment beam, may be projected onto the lens capsule tissue to aid in the treatment procedure. The shape and diameter of the visualization pattern may differ from that of the treatment beam pattern. Although the visualization pattern or portions of the visualization pattern may overlie the closed curve of the treatment pattern to indicate at least portions of the path to be taken by the treatment beam, this is not required. Instead, or in addition, at least part of the visualization pattern may overlie the intended location of the outer rim of the opening that will be produced by the tissue-separating treatment beam, or otherwise indicate the desired outcome of the treatment. The location of that outer rim typically differs from and is of larger diameter than the closed curve of the treatment beam pattern for two reasons: (i) the lens capsule tissue is under tension when in the eye (very much like a drum skin), so as the tissue along the closed curve is separated the exterior portion is under tension and pulled peripherally, thus enlarging the diameter; (ii) the mechanism of action for the treatment laser is to locally heat the irradiated anterior capsule on a closed curve, this heating tends to cause the collagen tissue to contract, shrink, and separate exteriorly and interiorly away from the heated closed curve. Alternatively, or in addition, at least part of the visualization pattern may correspond to one or more particular anatomical features of the eye. This may facilitate centering of the visualization pattern (and thus the treatment beam pattern) on the anatomy of the eye, or otherwise facilitate aiming the visualization and treatment beams. The visualization pattern may optionally include a cross-hair.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">
        <figref>FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an example visualization pattern <b>830</b> comprising a closed curve and at least three dots that may be used to assist in locating the desired location for a capsulorrhexis. The figure also identifies the limbus <b>810</b>, iris <b>140</b>, interior boundary of the iris <b>820</b>, and pupil <b>190</b> of the eye to be treated.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">

The inner circle or closed curve <b>910</b> represents the size and location of the desired opening in the anterior capsulorrhexis. The outer circle <b>920</b>, which may be sized independently of the inner circle size, may be used to center the capsulorrhexis on the limbus as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 9A</figref>. Alternatively, the outside circle may be sized to allow the centering on the interior boundary of the dilated pupil, as represented in <figref>FIG. 9B</figref>.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 10A-10B</figref> each show a view of an eye including the limbus <b>810</b>, iris <b>140</b>, and pupil <b>190</b> onto which is projected an example visualization pattern <b>1000</b> comprising two concentric circles or closed curves <b>1010</b> and <b>1020</b> with dots <b>1030</b> on the curves. The combination of straight and/or curved lines and dots provides a pattern easily focused on the target tissue. The lines are produced by moving the visualization beam along the desired pattern. The dots are produced by dwelling the visualization beam for longer periods at the dot locations in the scan pattern.

Treatment beam pattern <b>1590</b> differs from and is smaller than the visualization pattern inner ellipse.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Any other suitable visualization beam patterns may also be used. One or more visualization beam pattern shapes may be preprogrammed into a laser capsulorrhexis device (described in more detail below) by the manufacturer, for example. At or prior to the time of treatment an operator may then, for example, select a pattern size and shape to be used to guide the treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The location of the visual axis relative to center on the limbus or dilated pupil may also be measured on a separate diagnostic device. The offset data from center may then also be manually or automatically input into the laser capsulorrhexis device. In such cases, the visualization pattern may be arranged so that when an exterior portion of the visualization pattern (e.g., a circle) is positioned or centered on the eye anatomy of the limbus or dilated pupil, the center of an interior portion (e.g., a circle or ellipse) of the visualization pattern is offset from the center of the limbus or dilated pupil to lie on the visual axis. The center of the closed curve of the treatment pattern may be correspondingly offset from the center of the limbus or dilated pupil, so that the central circle or ellipse of the visualization pattern indicates the perimeter of the desired rhexis.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">The visualization pattern laser beam may have any suitable wavelength in the visible spectrum. The visualization beam may be scanned across the tissue to be treated at, for example, a speed greater than about 450 mm/second, though it may also dwell to form dots or other brighter features in the visualization pattern. Any suitable scanning speeds may be used. The diameter of the visualization light beam on the tissue surface may be, for example, about 50 to about 600 microns. The visualization laser beam power at the tissue may be, for example, less than about 10 mW or less than about 1 mW when the beam is dwelling on a dot in the visualization pattern. When the visualization beam is scanning its power may be, for example, less than about 30 mW. Generally the power and the wavelength of the laser beam are selected to provide a sufficiently visible visualization pattern without significantly depleting any absorbing agent that has been deposited on the tissue to facilitate treatment.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="2">Treatment Beam and Scanning Parameters</heading>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Generally, parameters characterizing the treatment laser beam and the treatment beam scanning procedure are selected to provide the desired laser induced thermal separation of tissue at the treated tissue while minimizing or reducing the risk of damage to the retina. These laser and scanning parameters may include, for example, laser wavelength, laser beam power, spot size at the treated tissue, fluence and peak irradiation at the treated tissue, spot size on the retina, fluence and peak irradiation on the retina, scanning speed, temporal profile of the laser beam during the scan, and scanning pattern size and location on the retina.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">Typically, a treatment beam from a continuous wave laser traces the treatment beam pattern in a single pass in a time period of, for example, less than about 10 seconds, less than about 5 seconds, less than about 1 second, about 10 seconds, about 5 seconds, or about 1 second. The treatment beam may move across the treated tissue at a speed, for example, of about 20 millimeters/second (mm/s) for a 1 second scan to about 2 mm/s for a 10 second scan, but any suitable scanning speed and duration may be used. The formation of irregularities or tears in the resulting rim of tissue is reduced or avoided because movement of the continuous wave laser beam along the treatment path occurs during irradiation of the treated tissue (rather than between discrete laser pulses, for example), and thus all portions of the rim are formed with the same or similar irradiation and thermal conditions. Using a single pass of the treatment beam also helps to ensure completion of the capsulorrhexis even if there is slight movement of the eye relative to the trajectory.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">In variations in which the treatment beam path begins on the interior of the closed curve of the treatment pattern (see <figref>FIG. 4C</figref>, for example), the initial scanning speed in the interior portion of the treatment path may be less than the scanning speed along the closed curve. The scanning speed on the interior portion may, for example, ramp up to the speed used along the closed curve. The average speed along the interior portion may be, for example, about Â½ of the scanning speed used along the closed curve, or about â of the scanning speed used along the closed curve, or between about Â½ and about â of the scanning speed used along the closed curve.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">Referring now to the plot of laser power versus time shown in <figref>FIG. 16</figref> for an example treatment beam scan, at the beginning of a treatment scan the power in the treatment beam may be ramped up slowly (and optionally monotonically, as shown, to be efficient with time). As noted above in the summary section, this slow ramp up may allow the tissue near the starting point of the pattern to initially stretch without separating, thereby reducing the shear stress/tension at the start of the pattern. This slow ramp up may also avoid or minimize local shock waves in the fluid adjacent to the target tissue that might otherwise be generated by a faster thermal turn-on. For example, the laser beam may ramp-up monotonically from zero to about 90% of full treatment power over a period of from about 5 milliseconds (ms) to about 200 ms, for example about 100 ms. This ramp-up of power typically occurs while the laser beam is scanned along an initial portion of the treatment path. In variations in which the treatment beam path begins on the interior of the closed curve of the treatment pattern (see again <figref>FIG. 4C</figref>, for example), the ramp-up in laser beam power may occur along the initial interior portion of the treatment path and be complete before the laser beam reaches the closed curve portion of the treatment pattern. In such variations the scanning speed of the beam along the initial interior portion of the treatment path may also ramp up to the speed used along the closed curve, as described above. The average speed along the interior portion of the path may be about 25% of the scanning speed used along the closed curve, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">As shown in <figref>FIG. 16</figref>, turn-off of the treatment laser beam pulse at the end of the treatment scan may be much more abrupt than turn-on.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">As noted earlier in this specification, the treatment laser beam wavelength may be selected to be strongly absorbed by a light absorbing agent optionally added onto or into the tissue to be treated. The treatment laser may operate at a wavelength of about 577 nanometers or about 810 nanometers, for example. In such examples the light absorbing agent, if used, may be Trypan Blue or Indocyanine Green, respectively. Alternatively, the treatment laser wavelength may be selected to be absorbed or strongly absorbed by the tissue itself. Any suitable wavelength for the treatment beam may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">As described in more detail below, typically the treatment laser beam is focused to a waist at or near the location of the tissue to be treated, and then expands in diameter as it propagates to the retina. Also, typically the scanning pattern is expanded on the retina compared to its size on the treated tissue. Consequently, parameters such as fluence and peak irradiation for the treatment beam may have different and larger values at the treated tissue compared to their values at the retina.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The methods and devices disclosed herein typically rely on laser induced thermal separation of tissue rather than on laser induced ablation, and may therefore use much lower treatment beam fluence and peak irradiation values at the treated tissue than typically required by other laser based surgical procedures. In addition, the methods and devices disclosed herein may use treatment laser beams having relatively high average power without producing peak irradiation values that are potentially damaging to the retina or other eye tissue, because these methods and devices may use long (e.g., 1 to 10 second) pulses from a continuous wave laser. In contrast, laser based surgical procedures using much shorter Q-switched or mode-locked laser pulses may be required to operate at much lower average powers to avoid potentially damaging peak irradiance values, which may increase the time required to provide a desired fluence.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The average power of the treatment beam, which is selected depending in part on the absorption strength of the absorbing agent at the treatment beam wavelength or the absorption strength of the treated tissue at the treatment beam wavelength, may be for example about 300 mW to about 3000 mW. Any suitable average power may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">The treatment beam fluence on a particular tissue depends on the average power in the treatment beam, the diameter of the treatment beam at that tissue, and the scanning speed of the treatment beam across that tissue. For the methods and devices disclosed herein, at the tissue to be treated (e.g., the anterior lens capsule) the treatment beam fluence for a 1 second scan may be for example about 80 Joules/centimeter<sup>2 </sup>(J/cm<sup>2</sup>) to about 450 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. For a 5 second scan the fluence at the tissue to be treated may be for example about 100 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 1600 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. For a 10 second scan the fluence at the tissue to be treated may be for example about 100 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 2000 J/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">The treatment beam peak irradiance on particular tissue depends on the peak power in the treatment beam and the diameter of the treatment beam at that tissue. For the methods and devices disclosed herein, at the tissue to be treated (e.g., the anterior lens capsule) the treatment beam peak irradiance may be, for example, less than about 50,000 Watt/centimeter<sup>2 </sup>(W/cm<sup>2</sup>), or less than about 100,000 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, or less than about 150,000 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, or less than about 200,000 W/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">In general, at the retina the treatment beam fluence is less than about 200 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>and the irradiance is less than about 2000 W/cm<sup>2</sup>. In one embodiment with an NA of about 0.03 and a beam diameter of about 1,400 microns on the retina, for a 1 second scan speed for example, the fluence at the retina has a maximum of about 5 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. For a 5 second scan the fluence at the retina may for example have a maximum of about 25 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. For a 10 second scan the fluence at the retina may for example have a maximum of about 50 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. The irradiance may have for example a maximum for example of about 200 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>on the retina, across these 1, 5 and 10 second scan speeds for a system with an NA of about 0.03.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 17</figref>, the inventor has discovered that the minimum treatment laser beam power required for laser induced separation of tissue has a non-linear response to the irradiated beam area on the treated tissue. In particular, this plot demonstrates that there is a low dependence of the power required for tissue separation on the size of the irradiated area, specifically below about a beam diameter of about 100 to about 200 microns. However, as the spot size increases far above a diameter of about 300 microns, more power is required to separate tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">Hence it may be preferable to use a treatment beam having a diameter of about 200 microns at the treated tissue. This may reduce the required irradiance in the treatment beam and thus decrease the risk of damaging the retina. More generally, the treatment laser beam may have a diameter of, for example, about 50 microns to about 400 microns at the treated tissue.</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="2">Use of Surgical Contact Lens</heading>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">A surgical contact lens may be used to neutralize or approximately neutralize the cornea's focusing power on the retina to further reduce risk of damaging the retina, and in particular to protect the fovea. (The fovea is located in the center of the macula region of the retina, and is responsible for sharp central vision). <figref>FIG. 18A</figref> demonstrates that in the absence of a surgical contact lens, a scanned treatment laser beam pattern <b>1800</b> centered around the visual axis <b>1810</b> would be focused into the proximity of the fovea <b>1820</b> on the retina. It is likely that the fovea would be under constant irradiation for the full duration of the scanned pattern. <figref>FIG. 18B</figref> demonstrates that in the presence of a surgical contact lens <b>1830</b> with a mild convex anterior surface <b>1840</b> minimizing the majority of the corneal optical lens power, a scanned laser beam pattern <b>1800</b> centered around the visual axis <b>1810</b> may be projected onto the retina such that it avoids the fovea and instead surrounds the fovea. <figref>FIG. 18C</figref> demonstrates that in the presence of a surgical contact lens <b>1830</b> with a concave anterior surface <b>1850</b>, a scanned laser beam pattern <b>1800</b> centered around the visual axis may be projected on to the retina so that it avoids the fovea and instead surrounds the fovea. Moreover, the trace of the laser beam projected on to the retina may be further refracted way from the fovea than would be the case for a convex surgical contact lens. In addition the area irradiated by the laser beam would be larger on the retina, which reduces the delivered laser energy per unit area (fluence) on the retina.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">Use of a surgical contact lens as just described to refract the scanned treatment beam pattern away from the fovea allows the treatment laser to be operated at a higher power, without damaging the fovea or other portions of the retina, than might otherwise be the case. Such use of a surgical contact lens is optional, however.</p>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="2">Treatment/Scanning Device</heading>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 19</figref>, an example device <b>1900</b> may be used to perform ophthalmic surgeries as described herein. <figref>FIG. 19</figref> illustrates the optical beam focusing and the scanner optical properties of this device. Device <b>1900</b> comprises an optical fiber <b>1910</b> that delivers collinear visualization and treatment laser beams <b>1920</b> to a lens <b>1930</b>, which focuses the beams beyond a two-dimensional scanner <b>1940</b>. The two-dimensional scanner <b>1940</b> scans the visualization or treatment laser beam to provide the desired visualization or treatment beam pattern. Lens <b>1950</b> focuses the treatment and visualization laser beams to a waist in the treated eye <b>1960</b> at or approximately at the anterior lens capsule <b>1970</b>. After passing through that waist the laser beams expand and are thus defocused on the retina. Optional stationary final mirror <b>1980</b> may be used as shown to direct the beams to be collinear or nearly collinear with microscope optics (see <figref>FIGS. 20-21</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">The two-dimensional scanner <b>1940</b> has different tilt positions to create a scanned pattern on the anterior capsule. The solid line depiction of the scanner represents one example tilt position, and the dash line depiction of the scanner represents a second tilt position. In this example device the optics are designed such that there is a scanner pattern invariant <b>1985</b> (a location at which there is no apparent motion of the scanned pattern) and waist between the lens <b>1950</b> and its focus. Compared to a system lacking a scanner pattern invariant located in this manner, this arrangement has the advantages of reducing or minimizing the size of the optical device, reducing or minimizing the required two-dimensional scanner tilt, reducing or minimizing the area required on the optional final mirror, and providing additional divergence of the scanned pattern along the optical path so that for the same size and shape pattern on the anterior capsule, the projection on the retina has a larger diameter and therefore less fluence and less associated temperature rise at the retina.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">Example device <b>1900</b> also includes an optional light detector <b>1990</b>. The two-dimensional scanner <b>1940</b> may deflect the treatment or visualization laser beams to detector <b>1990</b>, which may be used for example to measure their power. Detector <b>1990</b> may be a detector array, for example, in which case the two-dimensional scanner <b>1940</b> may scan the treatment or visualization laser beam across the detector array to confirm that the scanner is functioning properly.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">Device <b>1900</b> further includes an optional aberrometer <b>1995</b>, which may be used to make refractive measurements of the eye to be treated. This may be accomplished, for example, by tilting the two-dimensional scanner <b>1940</b> to direct an output light beam from aberrometer <b>1995</b> along the optical path used for the visualization and treatment beams into the eye. Alternatively, a light beam from aberrometer <b>1995</b> could optionally be introduced into the optical path of device <b>1900</b> with a dichroic beam splitter, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">Device <b>1900</b> includes a scanner controller, not shown. The scanner controller may be preprogrammed with one or more treatment beam pattern shapes and one or more visualization pattern shapes by the manufacturer, for example. At or prior to the time of treatment an operator may then, for example, select treatment and visualization pattern sizes and shapes to be used in a particular treatment procedure.</p>

      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="2">Depth Alignment</heading>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0092">A preliminary step in using device <b>1900</b> is to adjust the position of the device, or of the optical elements within the device, with respect to the patient's eye so that the waist (focus) of the treatment beam is at or approximately at the tissue to be treated. This may be done, for example, by viewing a visualization pattern (e.g., as described above) that is projected onto the tissue to be treated and adjusting device <b>1900</b> to bring the visualization pattern into focus on the tissue. However, in this approach any uncorrected deficiency in the operator's vision (e.g., myopia) may affect the operator's judgment as to whether or not the visualization pattern is in focus on the tissue to be treated. This may result in an incorrect adjustment of the treatment device.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0093">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 22</figref>, an example device <b>2200</b> for performing ophthalmic surgeries includes, in addition to the elements of device <b>1900</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 19</figref>, optical elements that produce a second visualization beam to facilitate depth alignment of the device. In particular, in a depth alignment mode, further described below, scanner <b>1940</b> in device <b>2200</b> dithers to direct a visible light visualization beam <b>1920</b> from optical fiber <b>1910</b> along two different optical paths to produce visualization beams <b>2210</b> and <b>2215</b>. Scanner <b>1940</b> may dither between the two paths at a rate greater than or equal to about 30 Hertz, for example, so that flickering of the two beams is not typically noticeable to an operator.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0094">Beam <b>2210</b> follows the optical path of the treatment and visualization laser beams described above with respect to <figref>FIG. 19</figref>, and may be scanned to produce any suitable pattern. Beam <b>2215</b> may also be scanned to produce any suitable pattern. Beam <b>2215</b> is directed to intersect beam <b>2210</b> at or approximately at the treatment beam waist. As further described below, the intersection of beams <b>2210</b> and <b>2215</b> may therefore be used to identify the location of the treatment beam waist and to determine whether or not the treatment beam waist is properly positioned at the tissue to be treated. In the illustrated example, beam <b>2215</b> is directed to intersect beam <b>2210</b> using mirror <b>2220</b> and lens <b>2230</b> but any other suitable optical arrangement producing the desired intersection may also be used. Lens <b>2230</b> typically focuses beam <b>2215</b> to a tight waist at the intersection of the two beams, to identify the location of that intersection with greater precision.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0095">If the intersection of beams <b>2210</b> and <b>2215</b> (and thus the treatment beam waist) is not properly positioned at the treatment tissue, the position of device <b>2200</b> or of optical elements within the device may be adjusted with respect to the patient's eye to move the intersection of the visualization beams, and thus the treatment beam waist, to the desired position.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0096">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 23A-23C</figref>, in some variations beam <b>2210</b> is scanned to produce a line <b>2310</b> and beam <b>2215</b> is not scanned but instead focused to a tight waist that appears as a dot <b>2315</b> in these figures. Device <b>2200</b> is aligned (e.g., by the manufacturer) so that beams <b>2210</b> and <b>2215</b> intersect at or approximately at the location of the waist of the treatment beam, with the dot <b>2315</b> centered or approximately centered on line <b>2310</b>. <figref>FIGS. 23A-23C</figref> show a view through a microscope (e.g., microscope <b>2000</b> of <figref>FIG. 20</figref>) of the tissue to be treated (e.g., the lens capsule). When the intersection of visualization beams <b>2210</b> and <b>2215</b> is not positioned at or approximately at the tissue to be treated, dot <b>2315</b> and line <b>2310</b> will appear to be displaced from each other as shown in <figref>FIGS. 23A-23B</figref>. Further, an operator may be able to determine whether the visualization beams intersect in front of or behind the tissue to be treated based on which side of line <b>2310</b> the dot <b>2315</b> appears to be located. After device <b>2200</b> is adjusted to position the intersection of beams <b>2210</b> and <b>2215</b> (and therefore the waist of the treatment beam) at or approximately at the tissue to be treated, line <b>2310</b> and dot <b>2315</b> will appear superimposed as shown in <figref>FIG. 23C</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0097">Although the illustrated example uses a line <b>2310</b> and a dot <b>2315</b>, any other suitable patterns for intersecting beams <b>2210</b> and <b>2215</b> may be used to identify and adjust the position of the treatment beam waist with respect to the tissue to be treated. Typically the visualization patterns used in depth alignment mode differ from those described earlier in this specification. Although in the illustrated example intersecting beams <b>2210</b> and <b>2215</b> are produced from a single visualization laser beam by dithering the scanner <b>1940</b>, any other suitable method of intersecting visible beams to identify the location of the treatment beam waist may also be used. Beams <b>2210</b> and <b>2215</b> may have the same wavelength, as in the example just described, or different wavelengths.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0098">Device <b>2200</b> may be switchable between several different operating modes including the depth alignment mode just described. For example, in some variations device <b>2200</b> may be switchable between at least the following modes: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>Standby Mode: The treatment beam and all visualization beams are off.</li><li>Depth Alignment Mode: As described above, intersecting visualization beams are used to facilitate adjusting the position of the focus of the treatment beam optical system with respect to the position of the tissue to be treated. The treatment beam is not activated.</li><li>Ready Mode: Visualization patterns are projected onto the lens capsule to guide the treatment. The visualization patterns may facilitate alignment of the treatment beam with respect to anatomy of the eye, and/or indicate the desired perimeter of a rhexis to be produced with the treatment beam.</li><li>Fire Mode: Treatment laser beam emission is activated and incident on the tissue to be treated.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0103">Referring to <figref>FIG. 24A</figref>, some variations of device <b>2200</b> may include a foot-operable control <b>2400</b> in which a first button <b>2405</b>, located on top of shroud <b>2410</b> for example, may be activated to switch from Standby to Depth Alignment Mode, with the device remaining in Depth Alignment Mode. Button <b>2405</b> may be activated again to switch from Depth Alignment Mode to Ready Mode, with the device remaining in Ready Mode. While the device is in Ready Mode, a shrouded fire button <b>2415</b> may be activated to switch from Ready Mode to Fire Mode, activating the treatment beam and the treatment beam scan, after which the device returns to Standby Mode. Alternatively, button <b>2405</b> may be activated again to switch from Ready Mode to Standby Mode.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0104">Some variations of device <b>2220</b> may also be switchable into and out of a Visualization Sizing Mode. In the Visualization Sizing Mode, a visualization sizing pattern is projected onto the anterior lens capsule to guide positioning of the desired rhexis and thus positioning of the desired closed curve of the treatment beam. The size (e.g., diameter or another dimension) of the visualization sizing pattern is adjustable to increase or decrease a corresponding dimension of the desired rhexis to be formed by the treatment beam. In these variations, the device may be switched between modes in the following order, for example: Standby Mode, Depth Alignment Mode, Visualization Sizing Mode, Ready Mode, Standby Mode. This may be done, for example, by sequential activation of button <b>2405</b> (<figref>FIG. 24A</figref>) as described above. The visualization sizing pattern projected during Visualization Sizing Mode may have the same geometry as the visualization pattern projected in Ready Mode, or be different. It may be advantageous for the visualization sizing pattern to differ in geometry from the visualization pattern, to make it easier for an operator to recognize in which mode the device is in.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0105">Referring to <figref>FIG. 24B</figref>, foot operable control <b>2400</b> may further include buttons <b>2420</b>A and <b>2420</b>B, located on interior or exterior side walls of the shroud for example, that may be used to increase or decrease the size of the visualization pattern projected during Visualization Sizing Mode (and correspondingly increase or decrease the desired radius or another dimension of the rhexis to be formed by the treatment beam).</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0106">Any other suitable switching mechanism may be used to switch between the operating modes just described. The switching mechanism may be or include switches intended to be hand operated, for example. Further, variations of foot-operable control <b>2400</b> described above, or of any other suitable switching mechanism, may be configured to allow the device to be switched from Depth Alignment Mode to Standby Mode, from Visualization Sizing Mode (if available) to Depth Alignment Mode, or from Ready Mode to Visualization Mode (if available) or Depth Alignment Mode. This may be accomplished using additional switching buttons for these transitions, for example, or with a button that reverses the direction in which button <b>2405</b> moves the device through the sequence of modes.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="2">Detecting a Light Absorbing Agent</heading>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0107">In variations of the procedures described herein in which a light absorbing agent is used to facilitate laser assisted thermal tissue separation, it may be desirable to optically or visually confirm that the light absorbing agent has been correctly placed prior to performing the treatment. This may be done, for example, with a detection laser beam having a wavelength selected to be reflected rather than absorbed by the light absorbing agent (and thus different from the wavelength of the treatment beam). For example, if the light absorbing agent is Trypan Blue the detection beam may be chosen to have a wavelength in the blue region of the visible spectrum. Alternatively, the light absorbing agent may be detected with the treatment beam by exciting and detecting fluorescence from the light absorbing agent. In the latter case the measurement may preferably be made at a position away from the treatment location to avoid depleting light absorbing agent required for the treatment scan.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0108">Reflected light or fluorescence indicating the presence of the light absorbing agent may be observed or detected, for example, through a microscope integrated with the treatment device as described above. A detection laser beam used in such a reflectance measurement may be introduced through the same optical fiber that delivers the treatment and visualization beams.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0109">This disclosure is illustrative and not limiting. Further modifications will be apparent to one skilled in the art in light of this disclosure and are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. For example, in some variations pulsed lasers may be use instead of continuous wave lasers to produce visualization and/or treatment laser beams in the methods and devices described above.</p>
