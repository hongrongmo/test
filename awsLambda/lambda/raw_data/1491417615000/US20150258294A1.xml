      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, therein illustrated is a portable device <b>2</b> according to various exemplary embodiments for providing an auxiliary air passage to the trachea. The device <b>2</b> may be used in various procedures for providing an auxiliary air passage to the trachea of a patient to allow the patient to continue receiving air. For example, the device <b>2</b> may be used for performing a tracheotomy or cricothyrotomy. The device <b>2</b> includes a cannula member <b>10</b>, a trocar member <b>18</b> and a cap member <b>26</b>. The cannula member <b>10</b> and trocar member <b>18</b> may be assembled in a first configuration to form a surgical tool for providing the auxiliary air passage to the trachea. The cannula member <b>10</b>, the trocar member <b>18</b> and the cap member <b>26</b> may be further assembled together into a second portable configuration. For example, in the second portable configuration, the cannula member <b>10</b> and the trocar member <b>18</b> may be maintained in a sterilized state with the trocar member <b>18</b> being shielded, typically by the cap member <b>26</b>, to prevent injury.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The cannula member <b>10</b> includes longitudinal walls <b>34</b> defining a longitudinal axis <b>42</b>. Inner surfaces of the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> define a hollow channel <b>50</b> extending in the direction of the longitudinal axis <b>42</b>. A distal end <b>58</b> of the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> defines a distal first end opening <b>66</b> that is in fluid communication with the channel <b>50</b>. For example, a plane defining the distal end opening <b>66</b> is oriented transversely to the longitudinal axis <b>42</b>. A proximal end <b>74</b> of the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> defines a proximal second end opening <b>68</b> opposite the distal end opening <b>66</b>. The proximal end opening <b>68</b> is in fluid communication with the distal end opening <b>66</b> via the hollow channel <b>50</b>. For example, a plane defining the proximal end opening <b>68</b> is oriented transversely to the longitudinal axis <b>42</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">According to various exemplary embodiments, the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> further define a third opening, that is a side opening <b>82</b> located at the distal end <b>58</b>. For example, the side opening <b>82</b> is located proximate the distal end opening <b>66</b> but spaced apart from the distal end opening <b>66</b>, as herein illustrated. However, the side opening <b>82</b> could also extend to the distal end opening <b>66</b>, such as to merge therewith. It will be appreciated that the side opening <b>82</b> is oriented transversely to an orientation of the distal end opening <b>66</b>. For example, the side opening <b>82</b> can be elongated, as herein shown, and oriented longitudinally along the longitudinal walls <b>34</b>. For instance, the side opening <b>82</b> can be oblong, as herein shown.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The side opening <b>82</b> is in fluid communication with the channel <b>50</b>. The side opening <b>82</b> may be in fluid communication with the channel <b>50</b> independently of the distal end opening <b>66</b>. For example, where the distal end opening <b>66</b> is blocked, fluid communication of the channel <b>50</b> with an environment surrounding the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> can be maintained via the side opening <b>82</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">According to various exemplary embodiments, the cannula member <b>10</b> further includes an adapter portion <b>90</b> having circumferential walls <b>98</b> and an annular base <b>106</b>. The annular base <b>106</b> is oriented transversely to the longitudinal axis <b>42</b>. The circumferential walls <b>98</b> and the annular base <b>106</b> define together an adapter chamber <b>114</b> having an end opening <b>122</b>. The annular base <b>106</b> provides an interface between the circumferential walls <b>98</b> and the longitudinal walls <b>34</b>. The longitudinal walls <b>34</b> extend longitudinally from an outer surface <b>130</b> of the annular base <b>106</b>. The channel <b>50</b> of the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> is further in fluid communication with the adapter chamber <b>114</b> via the proximal end opening <b>68</b> and an opening of the annular base <b>106</b>. Accordingly, the end opening <b>122</b> of the adapter chamber <b>114</b> is in fluid communication with the distal end opening <b>66</b>. According to various exemplary embodiments where the cannula member <b>10</b> includes the side opening <b>82</b>, the end opening <b>122</b> of the adapter chamber <b>114</b> may be further in communication with the side opening <b>82</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">According to various exemplary embodiments, the adapter portion <b>90</b> may further include a marking <b>134</b> located at an angular position about the longitudinal axis <b>42</b> corresponding to an angular position of the side opening <b>82</b>. In other words, the side opening <b>82</b> and the marking <b>134</b> are in a same plane that extends radially from the longitudinal axis <b>42</b>. Alignment of the marking <b>134</b> with the side opening <b>82</b> allows a user to identify the position of the side opening <b>82</b> when the side opening <b>82</b> is hidden from view. The user will thus be able, from the position of the marking <b>134</b>, to evaluate where the side opening <b>82</b> opens up, thereby enabling the user to manipulate the cannula member <b>10</b> so as to typically orient the side opening <b>82</b> inferiorly thus directing air towards the lungs. For example, the marking <b>134</b> may be a notch or groove formed on the annular base <b>106</b>, or indicia printed thereon.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">According to various exemplary embodiments and as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, a diameter of the circumferential walls <b>98</b> of the adapter portion <b>90</b> of the cannula member <b>10</b> is substantially greater than a diameter of the longitudinal walls <b>34</b>. Accordingly, the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> are narrower than the adapter portion <b>90</b>. For example, the dimensions of the circumferential walls <b>98</b> correspond to the standard dimensions of a ventilation port of a respiratory apparatus that provides air or oxygen to an external device through the ventilation port. It will be appreciated that in this case, the cannula member <b>10</b> is the external device of the respiratory apparatus. For example, the respiratory apparatus is an ambubag. When the ventilation port is attached to the adapter portion <b>90</b> of the cannula member <b>10</b>, the respiratory apparatus is in fluid communication with at least one of the distal end opening <b>66</b> and side opening <b>82</b>. Accordingly, air or oxygen provided by the respiratory apparatus is flowed through the distal end opening <b>66</b> and/or side opening <b>82</b> to an environment surrounding the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> adjacent the distal end <b>58</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">According to various exemplary embodiments, the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> and the adapter portion <b>90</b> of the cannula member <b>10</b> are integrally formed. Accordingly, the cannula member <b>10</b> includes both a respiratory channel for a tracheostomy (provided by the channel <b>50</b> defined by the longitudinal walls <b>34</b>) and an adapter for attachment with a ventilation port (provided by the adapter portion <b>90</b>) within a unitary body.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The trocar member <b>18</b> includes a flanged end <b>138</b> and an elongated member <b>146</b> extending therefrom. For example, a proximal end <b>154</b> of the elongated member <b>146</b> proximate the flanged end <b>138</b> is outwardly tapered. A distal end <b>162</b> of the elongated member <b>146</b> is pointed. The pointed distal end <b>162</b> of the elongated member <b>146</b> forms a piercing member operable to pierce the soft tissues of the neck overlying the trachea and the cricothyroid membrane or anterior tracheal wall of a patient in order to enter the airway.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The outer diameter of elongated member <b>146</b> is appropriately sized according to an inner diameter of the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> of the cannula member <b>10</b> so that the elongated member <b>146</b> is insertable within the channel <b>50</b>. The length of the elongated member <b>146</b> is further appropriately sized according to a length of the channel <b>50</b> so that the pointed end <b>162</b> of the elongated member <b>146</b> projects through the distal end opening <b>66</b> when the elongated member <b>146</b> is inserted within the channel <b>50</b>. For example, the length of the elongated member <b>146</b> may be appropriately sized according to a length of the channel <b>50</b> and a length of the adapter chamber <b>114</b> so that the pointed end <b>162</b> of the elongated member <b>146</b> projects through the distal end opening <b>66</b> when the elongated member <b>146</b> is inserted in the cannula member <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">According to various exemplary embodiments, the trocar member <b>18</b> may be sealingly engageable with the cannula member <b>10</b> to seal the end opening <b>122</b> of the adapter chamber <b>114</b>. Sealing the end opening <b>122</b> of the adapter chamber <b>114</b> further seals the proximal end opening <b>68</b> of the channel <b>50</b>. For example, the trocar member <b>18</b> includes externally threaded portion <b>170</b> for engaging internal threads <b>178</b> of the circumferential walls <b>98</b> of the adapter portion <b>90</b>, thereby securing the trocar member <b>18</b> to the cannula member <b>10</b>. For example, the externally threaded portion <b>170</b> may correspond to an outer portion of the flanged end <b>138</b> or to an outer portion of the proximal end <b>154</b> of the elongated member <b>146</b>. For example, a first sealing member <b>186</b>, such as an O-ring, may be further provided about the externally threaded portion <b>170</b> to aid in forming a seal.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">When the elongated member <b>146</b> and at least internal surfaces of the cannula member <b>10</b> have been sterilized, sealing the adapter chamber <b>114</b> when the elongated member <b>146</b> is inserted within the channel <b>50</b> maintains the elongated member <b>146</b> and at least the internal surfaces of the cannula member <b>10</b> in their sterilized states. The outer portion of cannula member <b>10</b>, which also has been sterilized, will remain in its sterilized state when contained within the cap member <b>26</b>. In fact, all of the areas of the cannula member <b>10</b> and of the trocar member <b>18</b>, which have been made sterile, will remain sterile as long as contained in the cap member <b>26</b>, i.e. once the cannula member <b>10</b> has been sealingly assembled to the cap member <b>26</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The sealed engagement of the trocar member <b>18</b> and cannula member <b>10</b> is formed independently of any engagement of the trocar member <b>18</b> or cannula member <b>10</b> with the cap member <b>26</b>. For example, a secured engagement of the trocar member <b>18</b> and the cannula member <b>10</b> is maintained when the cap member <b>26</b> is disengaged from the cannula member <b>10</b> and/or from the trocar member <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Insertion of the elongated member <b>146</b> within the channel <b>50</b> of the cannula member <b>10</b> so that the pointed end <b>162</b> projects from the distal end opening <b>66</b> forms a tool for providing an auxiliary air passage to the trachea of a patient. The tool is operated by first performing a piercing action wherein the pointed end <b>162</b> is displaced to pierce the skin of the neck region of a patient and to pierce the cricothyroid membrane or the anterior wall of the trachea of the patient. Accordingly, at least the end <b>58</b> of the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> of the cannula member <b>10</b> proximate the distal end opening <b>66</b> is positioned within the trachea of the patient, such that the distal end opening <b>66</b> and the side opening <b>82</b> are both in the trachea.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Furthermore, the cannula member <b>10</b> may be rotated to orient the marking <b>134</b>, and consequently the side opening <b>82</b>, in a direction promoting air flow into the trachea. For example, the side opening <b>82</b> is oriented towards a lower portion of the trachea, i.e. down towards the lungs. The tool is further operated by disengaging the trocar member <b>18</b> from the cannula member <b>10</b> while maintaining the end <b>58</b> of the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> within the trachea. For example, the trocar member <b>18</b> is unsecured from the cannula member <b>10</b> and the elongated member <b>146</b> is withdrawn from the channel <b>50</b> and adapter chamber <b>114</b>. Accordingly, the cannula member <b>10</b> provides a fluid path between an exterior of the patient and the trachea thereof via at least the proximal end opening <b>68</b>, the channel <b>50</b> and at least one of the distal end opening <b>66</b> and side opening <b>82</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">According to various exemplary embodiments where the side opening <b>82</b> is provided, the side opening <b>82</b> advantageously provides an alternative fluid path where the distal end opening <b>66</b> is blocked. For example, during the piercing action or subsequently, the user may have caused the end <b>58</b> of the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> to abut against an object in the trachea so as to cause the distal end opening <b>66</b> to be blocked. For example, the end <b>58</b> may be abutting against the posterior wall of the trachea. In such situations, the fluid path between the exterior of the patient and the trachea is maintained via the side opening <b>82</b>. Advantageously, the user is not required to constantly ensure an accurate depth of insertion of the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> within the trachea, such as constantly ensuring that the distal end opening <b>66</b> is not abutting against a wall of the trachea.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Secured engagement of the trocar member <b>18</b> and cannula member <b>10</b> further assists in operating the tool. For example, when performing the piercing action, a user only needs to manipulate one of the cannula member <b>10</b> and the trocar member <b>18</b>. Due to the secured engagement, the other of the cannula member <b>10</b> and the trocar member <b>18</b> will follow during the piercing action. Accordingly, the user does not need to position his/her fingers so as to simultaneously manipulate both the cannula member <b>10</b> and the trocar member <b>18</b> during the piercing action.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">According to various exemplary embodiments where the cannula member <b>10</b> includes the adapter portion <b>90</b>, disengaging the trocar member <b>18</b> from the cannula member <b>10</b> readies the cannula member <b>10</b> for attachment to a ventilation port of a respiratory apparatus. For example, further attachment of an adapter onto the cannula member <b>10</b> is not required in order to attach a ventilation port of a respiratory apparatus with the cannula member.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The cap member <b>26</b> defines an inner cavity <b>194</b> having an end opening <b>202</b>. The cap member <b>26</b> is further adapted to sealingly engage either the cannula member <b>10</b> or the trocar member <b>18</b>. When so engaged, at least a portion of the cannula member <b>10</b> is sealed within the inner cavity <b>194</b> of the cap member <b>26</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">According to various exemplary embodiments, the cap member <b>26</b> sealingly engages the cannula member <b>10</b>. For example, the cap member <b>26</b> is appropriately sized so that the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> of the cannula member <b>10</b> and the pointed end <b>162</b> of the trocar member <b>18</b> can be received within the inner cavity <b>194</b> and sealed therein. For example, the cap member <b>26</b> can be secured to the cannula member <b>10</b> about the annular base <b>106</b> to form a seal therewith. The cannula member <b>10</b> may include an externally threaded portion <b>210</b> for engaging internal threads <b>218</b> of the cap member <b>26</b>. For example, the externally threaded portion <b>210</b> may correspond to an outer portion of the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> proximate the adapter portion <b>90</b> or to an outer portion of the annular base <b>106</b>. For example, a second sealing member <b>226</b>, such as an O-ring, may be further provided about the externally threaded portion <b>210</b> to aid in forming a seal.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Alternatively, the trocar member <b>18</b> may include a second externally threaded portion having an outer diameter greater than an outer diameter of the first externally threaded portion <b>170</b>. The second externally threaded portion may engage the internal threads <b>218</b> of the cap member <b>26</b>, and the cap member <b>26</b> is appropriately sized to house the whole of the cannula member <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Engagement of the cap member <b>26</b> with one of the cannula member <b>10</b> and the trocar member <b>18</b> forms a portable ready-to-use device for providing an auxiliary air passage to the trachea. The cap member <b>26</b> covers the pointed end <b>162</b> of the elongated member <b>146</b> of the trocar member <b>18</b> so that the trocar member <b>18</b> can be carried without the pointed end <b>162</b> presenting a piercing hazard. When the elongated member <b>146</b> and at least outer surfaces of the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> are sterilized, sealing the elongated member <b>146</b> and the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> within the inner cavity <b>194</b> of the cap member <b>26</b> maintains the elongated member <b>146</b> and the longitudinal walls <b>34</b> in their sterilized states. For example, a distal end <b>234</b> of the cap member <b>26</b> defines a loop <b>242</b> for attachment with an external member. For example, the cap member <b>26</b>, and in fact the whole device <b>2</b> when assembled, can be attached to a key chain via the loop <b>242</b> so that it can be conveniently carried without getting lost. When there is a need to urgently use the cannula member <b>10</b> and the trocar member <b>18</b>, the cannula member <b>10</b> and the trocar member <b>18</b> are disengaged from the cap member <b>26</b> so that they can be used to perform a tracheotomy, whereas the cap member <b>26</b> conveniently stays on the key chain or the like, and does not get lost.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Disengagement of the cap member <b>26</b> from the one of the cannula member <b>10</b> and the trocar member <b>18</b> exposes the surgical tool formed of the cannula member <b>10</b> and trocar member <b>18</b>. As the secured engagement of the cannula member <b>10</b> and the trocar member <b>18</b> is maintained when the cap member <b>26</b> is disengaged, the surgical tool is ready for use without requiring further assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The present device <b>2</b> could also be modified. For instance, the device <b>2</b>, according to various exemplary embodiments, could take on a curved configuration, wherein the cannula member (and its associated components) would be curved, as known in conventional tracheotomy devices. The trocar member would have a similar configuration so as to be slidable in the cannula member, as would the cap member so that it could be engaged over at least parts of the assembled cannula and trocar members.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">While the above description provides examples of the embodiments, it will be appreciated that some features and/or functions of the described embodiments are susceptible to modification without departing from the spirit and principles of operation of the described embodiments. Accordingly, what has been described above has been intended to be illustrative of the embodiments and non-limiting, and it will be understood by persons skilled in the art that other variants and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the embodiments as defined in the claims appended hereto.</p>
