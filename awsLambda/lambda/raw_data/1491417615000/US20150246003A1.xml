      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Disclosed herein are methods and pharmaceutical delivery devices for the transmucosal delivery of active agents to a subject and methods of making such devices. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the pharmaceutical delivery devices of the present invention allow improved loading of the active agent, and in some embodiments, enhanced uptake of the active agent in a subject by simultaneously enabling at least two sites of adhesion and drug delivery for each device. For example, exemplary pharmaceutical delivery devices of the present invention may include at least two mucoadhesive surfaces such that the active agent is absorbed across both mucosal surfaces simultaneously.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Provided herein are methods of transmucosally delivering an active agent to a subject in need thereof, by administering to said subject in need thereof a thin and flexible pharmaceutical delivery device. The device is composed of a first mucoadhesive surface for transmucosal delivery of an active agent and a second mucoadhesive surface, opposing the first mucoadhesive surface, for transmucosal delivery of an active agent. The device also includes an active agent incorporated therein. The first and second mucoadhesive surfaces are defined by at least one thin and flexible mucoadhesive film layer. An effective amount of the active agent is delivered to a subject upon administration. Both mucoadhesive surfaces are formulated for the transmucosal delivery of an active agent. In certain other embodiments, the device is bioerodable. The device, for instance, can erode in the oral cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In some embodiments, the device includes a first and a second mucoadhesive surface that are on opposing sides of a single mucoadhesive layer. That is, the first and second mucoadhesive surfaces are defined by a single mucoadhesive layer. In other embodiments, the device is a multi-layered device comprising at least two mucoadhesive layers, wherein the first and second mucoadhesive surfaces are defined by at least a first and a second thin and flexible mucoadhesive film layer. There are certain embodiments wherein the first and second mucoadhesive surfaces are on opposing sides of the two outermost layers.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In some embodiments, the device contains at least one intermediate layer. For example a device having two thin and flexible mucoadhesive film layers may have an intermediate layer disposed between the two mucoadhesive film layers, such that the two mucoadhesive surfaces of the mucoadhesive film layers are opposing each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In some embodiments, the device further contains an abuse-resistant matrix and an antagonist associated with the abuse-resistant matrix such that abuse of the active agent is prevented. In some embodiments, the intermediate layer includes the abuse-resistant matrix and an antagonist associated with the abuse-resistant matrix such that the antagonist is substantially transmucosally unavailable. In some embodiments, the abuse-resistant matrix is disposed between a first mucoadhesive layer and a second mucoadhesive layer.

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In order to more clearly and concisely describe the subject matter of the claims, the following definitions are intended to provide guidance as to the meaning of terms used herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">As used herein, the articles âaâ and âanâ mean âone or moreâ or âat least one,â unless otherwise indicated. That is, reference to any element of the present invention by the indefinite article âaâ or âanâ does not exclude the possibility that more than one of the element is present.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The terms âabusable drugâ or âdrugâ as used interchangeably herein, refers to any pharmaceutically active substance or agent that has the ability to promote abuse, high tolerance with extended use, and/or chemical or physical dependency. Abusable drugs include, but are not limited to, drugs for the treatment of pain such as an opioid analgesic, e.g., and opioid or an opiate.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">As used herein, the term âantagonistâ refers to a moiety that renders the active agent unavailable to produce a pharmacological effect, inhibits the function of an agonist, e.g., an abusable drug, at a specific receptor, or produces an adverse pharmacological effect. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that antagonists generally do not alter the chemical structure of the abusable drug itself, but rather work, at least in part, by an effect on the subject, e.g., by binding to receptors and hindering the effect of the agonist. Antagonists can compete with an agonist for a specific binding site (competitive antagonists) and/or can bind to a different binding site from the agonist, hindering the effect of the agonist via the other binding site (non-competitive antagonists). Non-limiting examples of antagonists include opioid neutralizing antibodies; narcotic antagonists such as naloxone, naltrexone and nalmefene; dysphoric or irritating agents such as scopolamine, ketamine, atropine or mustard oils; or any combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the antagonist is naloxone or naltrexone.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The term âabuse-resistant matrixâ refers generally to a matrix with which an antagonist to an abusable drug is associated. An abuse resistant matrix is a matrix that effectively releases the antagonist when the device is used in an abusive manner (e.g., dissolved in water in an attempt to extract the drug, solubilized, opened, chewed and/or cut apart) so that, e.g., the antagonist is co-extracted and alters or blocks the effect the drug. However, when used as intended, e.g., in a non-abusive manner, the abuse-resistant matrix does not effectively release the antagonist. E.g., the antagonist instead is retained within the matrix and is delivered to the gastrointestinal tract where it is not readily absorbed such that any amount of antagonist delivered systemically through the mucosa and/or the GI tract does not significantly block or alter the effect of the drug.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">As used herein, the term âabusive mannerâ refers to the use of the delivery device in a manner not intended, e.g., in a non-transmucosal manner or in a manner not otherwise prescribed by a physician. In some embodiments, the abusive manner includes extraction of the drug from the delivery device for oral or parenteral administration. As used herein, ânon-abusive mannerâ refers to the use of the delivery device for its intended purpose, e.g., transmucosal administration of the drug. In some cases, a portion of the drug will unintentionally be delivered non-transmucosally, e.g., orally through the dissolution of a portion of the device. Such inadvertent or unintentional delivery is not indicative of use in an abusive manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">As used herein, âtreatmentâ of a subject includes the administration of a drug to a subject with the purpose of preventing, curing, healing, alleviating, relieving, altering, remedying, ameliorating, improving, stabilizing or affecting a disease or disorder, or a symptom of a disease or disorder (e.g., to alleviate pain).</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The term âsubjectâ refers to living organisms such as humans, dogs, cats, and other mammals. Administration of the active agents included in the devices provided herein can be carried out at dosages and for periods of time effective for treatment of a subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">An âeffective amountâ of an active agent necessary to achieve a therapeutic effect may vary according to factors such as the age, sex, and weight of the subject. Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. Similarly, effective amounts of antagonist to an abusable drug will vary according to additional factors such as the amount of abusable drug included in the devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">As used herein, the term âincorporatedâ as used with respect to incorporation of an active agent into the devices herein disclosed, or any layer of the devices, refers to the active agent being disposed within, associated with, mixed with, or otherwise part of a transmucosal device, e.g., within one or more layers of a multilayered device or existing as a layer or coating of the device. It is to be understood that the mixture, association or combination need not be regular or homogeneous.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In certain aspects, pharmaceutical delivery devices are provided for transmucosally delivering an active agent to a subject in need thereof. The device includes a thin and flexible film that possesses mucoadhesive properties making it suitable for adhesion to mucosal surfaces. For example, the film's properties permit administration of an active agent to a subject by adhering the device to two or more mucosal surfaces of the buccal cavity of a subject. In some embodiments, the device includes a thin flexible film, having a first mucoadhesive surface for the directional diffusion of an active agent across a first mucosal surface; a second mucoadhesive surface, opposing the first mucoadhesive surface, for the directional diffusion of an active agent across a second mucosal surface; and at least one active agent incorporated into the device such that there are multi-directional diffusions across at least two mucosal surfaces. The thin and flexible mucoadhesive film, interchangeably described herein as a mucoadhesive layer, includes at least two mucoadhesive surfaces. The first mucoadhesive surface is situated opposite the second mucoadhesive surface and allows directional diffusion of an active agent across a first mucosal surface to which it is adhered. The second mucoadhesive surface, adhered to a second mucosal surface, allows directional diffusion of an active agent across the second mucosal surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">While in some embodiments, the device includes a single mucoadhesive layer, in others the device is a multi-layered device such as a device having two mucoadhesive layers. The two mucoadhesive layers are disposed such that the device retains two opposing mucoadhesive surfaces. For example, the two layers of a two-layered device may be coated, one on top of the other, such that the two outermost surfaces are mucoadhesive. It is also contemplated that any other method known to one skilled in the art for the preparation of a multi-layered device may be employed. For example, certain lamination processes may be employed in the preparation of the multi-layered device.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In other embodiments, the device includes one or more intermediate layers disposed between the two outermost mucoadhesive surfaces. The intermediate layer is formulated such that in certain embodiments it provides stability to the device. In other embodiments, the intermediate layer is formed such that it is an occlusive barrier preventing the diffusion of an active agent from one layer of the device to another. For example, where the device has two mucoadhesive layers, an intermediate layer can be placed between the two mucoadhesive layers to prevent the diffusion of an active agent incorporated into the first and/or second mucoadhesive layer, from diffusing into the other layer. An occlusive intermediate layer prevents diffusion of an active agent from a first mucoadhesive layer of the device to a second mucoadhesive layer of the device. The intermediate layer may also be used to incorporate an abuse-resistant matrix or additional active agents. Multi-layered devices that have more than two mucoadhesive layers are also contemplated. The device, for example, may contain between 2 and 10 layers. All layers situated between the two outermost mucoadhesive layers are herein considered intermediate layers. Accordingly, an intermediate layer may also be a mucoadhesive layer, possessing all the same, or different, properties of the outermost mucoadhesive layers.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In some embodiments, the device includes two mucoadhesive layers and two active agents wherein the first active agent is incorporated into the first mucoadhesive layer and the second active agent is incorporated into the second mucoadhesive layer. In some embodiments, the device includes two mucoadhesive layers and two active agents, wherein the first active agent and the second active agent are both incorporated into the first mucoadhesive layer and the second active agent is also incorporated into the second mucoadhesive layer. It is to be understood that zero, one or more than one active agent may be included in each mucoadhesive layer of the devices disclosed herein, provided that at least one layer has at least one active agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In some embodiments, the device includes more than one mucoadhesive layer, one or more intermediate layers as described herein, and a single active agent incorporated into one or more mucoadhesive layers and/or intermediate layers. In some embodiments, the device includes more than one mucoadhesive layer, one or more intermediate layers as described herein, and more than one active agent incorporated into one or more mucoadhesive layers and/or one or more intermediate layers.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In some embodiments, the device includes more than one mucoadhesive layer as described herein such that the device adheres to the buccal mucosa and gum tissue, or any other mucosal surface of the oral cavity. In some embodiments, the device adheres to the sublingual mucosa. In certain embodiments the device, for example is adhered to the inner cheek and the gum, or the inner cheek, buccal mucosa and the retromolar trigone. In further embodiments, the device is administered, for example, beneath the tongue of a subject and adheres to the underside of the tongue and or frenulum and the floor of the oral cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In one embodiment, the device includes an opioid as the active agent. Some embodiments also provide a device having an opioid and a corresponding antagonist incorporated into any combination of layers discussed herein. In one embodiment, an antagonist and an opioid may be incorporated in the same mucoadhesive layer. In another embodiment, an antagonist is incorporated into a first mucoadhesive layer and an opioid incorporated into a second mucoadhesive layer. In yet a further embodiment, an antagonist is incorporated in two or more mucoadhesive layers and an opioid is incorporated into one of the mucoadhesive layers. In a further embodiment, an opioid is incorporated in two or more mucoadhesive layers and an antagonist is incorporated into one of the mucoadhesive layers. In one embodiment, an opioid is incorporated in one or more mucoadhesive layers and an antagonist is incorporated into one or more intermediate layers. In another embodiment, an antagonist is incorporated in one or more mucoadhesive layers and an opioid is incorporated into one or more intermediate layers. In a further embodiment, the opioid is incorporated into one or more mucoadhesive layers and one or more intermediate layers and the antagonist is incorporated into any one of the mucoadhesive or intermediate layers or incorporated into any combination of the mucoadhesive layers and the intermediate layers. In a further embodiment, the antagonist is incorporated into one or more mucoadhesive layers and one or more intermediate layers and the opioid is incorporated into any one of the mucoadhesive or intermediate layers or incorporated into any combination of the mucoadhesive layers and the intermediate layers. The antagonist in such embodiments can be associated with an abuse-resistant matrix as described in further detail herein. In some embodiments, the abuse-resistant matrix is an intermediate layer. In other embodiments the abuse-resistant matrix is an encapsulated form of the antagonist disbursed within any of the intermediate or outermost layers of the device. In certain embodiments, the opioid and the antagonist are incorporated such that they are inseparable, by pealing or any other mechanical means.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The devices and methods disclosed herein generally include an active agent. The term âactive agentâ refers to an agent to be incorporated into the devices and generally does not refer to the polymers employed to synthesize the mucoadhesive. Active agents include any compounds having a property of biological interest, e.g., ones that have a role in the life processes of a living organism. An active agent may be organic or inorganic, a monomer or a polymer, endogenous to a host organism or not, naturally occurring or synthesized in vitro and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The active agent may comprise a single pharmaceutical or a combination of pharmaceuticals that are suitable for transmucosal and/or sublingual delivery. Pharmaceuticals include, but are not limited to abusable drugs, antagonists, anti-inflammatory analgesic agents, steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, antihistamines, local anesthetics, bactericides, disinfectants, vasoconstrictors, hemostatics, chemotherapeutic drugs, antibiotics, keratolytics, cauterizing agents, and antiviral drugs antirheumatics, antihypertensives, bronchodilators, anticholinergics, antimenimic compounds, hormones, and macromolecules, peptides, proteins, vaccines, serotonin antagonists such as 5-HT3 antagonists, antianxiety agents, hypnotics, serotonin agonists such as 5-HT agonists or anti-migraine products. The amount of active agent to be used depends on the desired treatment strength and the composition of the layers, although preferably, the pharmaceutical component comprises from about 0.001 to about 99, more preferably from about 0.003 to about 30, and most preferably from about 0.005 to about 20% by weight of the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Examples of pharmaceuticals include, but are not limited to acetaminophen, methyl salicylate, monoglycol salicylate, aspirin, mefenamic acid, flufenamic acid, indomethacin, diclofenac, aiclofenac, diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, pranoprofen, fenoprofen, sulindac, fenclofenac, clidanac, flurbiprofen, fentiazac, bufexamac, piroxicam, phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, clofezone, pentazocine, mepirizole, tiaramide hydrochloride, hydrocortisone, predonisolone, dexamethasone, triamcinolone acetonide, fluocinolone acetonide, hydrocortisone acetate, predonisolone acetate, methyipredonisolone, dexamethasone acetate, betamethasone, betamethasone valerate, flumetasone, fluorometholone, beclomethasone diproprionate, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, diphenhydramine salicylate, diphenhydramine, chiorpheniramine hydrochloride, chlorpheniramine maleate isothipendyl hydrochloride, tripelennamine hydrochloride, promethazine hydrochloride, methdilazine hydrochloride, dibucaine hydrochloride, dibucaine, lidocaine hydrochloride, lidocaine, benzocaine, p buthylaminobenzoic acid 2-(di-ethylamino) ethyl ester hydrochloride, procaine hydrochloride, tetracaine, tetracaine hydrochloride, chioroprocaine hydrochloride, oxyprocaine hydrochloride, mepivacaine, cocaine hydrochloride, piperocaine hydrochloride, dyclonine, dyclonine hydrochloride, thimerosal, phenol, thymol, benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, chlorhexidine, povidone iode, cetylpyridinium chloride, eugenol, trimethylammonium bromide, naphazoline nitrate, tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride, oxymetazoline hydrochloride, phenylephrine hydrochloride, tramazoline hydrochloride, thrombin, phytonadione, protamine sulfate, aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid, carbazochrome, carbaxochrome sodium sulfanate, rutin, hesperidin, sulfamine, sulfathiazole, sulfadiazine, homosulfamine, sulfisoxazole, sulfisomidine, sulfamethizole, nitrofurazone, penicillin, meticillin, oxacillin, cefalotin, cefalordin, erythromcycin, lincomycin, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, metacycline, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, gentamicin, bacitracin, cycloserine, salicylic acid, podophyllum resin, podolifox, cantharidin, chloroacetic acids, silver nitrate, protease inhibitors, thymadine kinase inhibitors, sugar or glycoprotein synthesis inhibitors, structural protein synthesis inhibitors, attachment and adsorption inhibitors, and nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir, penciclovir, valacyclovir, and ganciclovir, ondansetron, granisetron and palonosetron, benzodiazepine derivatives, midazolam, clonazepam, alprazolam, zolpidem, eszopiclone, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, frovatriptan, rizatriptan, almotriptan, eletriptan, and prochlorperazine.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In some embodiments, the active agent is an abusable drug. In some embodiments, the abusable drug can be, but is not limited to opiates and opioids, e.g., alfentanil, allylprodine, aiphaprodine, apornorphine, anileridine, apocodeine, benzylmorphine, bezitramide, buprenorphine, butorphanol, clonitazene, codeine, cyclorphan, cyprenorphine, desomorphine, dextromoramide, dextropropoxyphene, dezocine, diampromide, diamorphone, dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, dimenoxadol, eptazocine, ethylmorphine, etonitazene, etorphine, fentanyl, fencamfamine, fenethylline, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, hydroxymethylmorphinan, hydroxypethidine, isomethadone, levomethadone, levophenacylmorphan, levorphanol, lofentanil, mazindol, meperidine, metazocine, methadone, methylmorphine, modafinil, morphine, nalbuphene, necomorphine, normethadone, normorphine, opium, oxycodone, oxymorphone, pholcodine, profadol remifentanil, sufentanil, tramadol, corresponding derivatives, physiologically acceptable compounds, salts and bases. In some embodiments, the active agent is fentanyl. In some embodiments, the active agent is buprenorphine.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In some embodiments, the devices include a combination of an abusable drug and an antagonist. The abusable drug and antagonist can be any abusable drug or antagonist known in the art, e.g., those described herein. In certain embodiments the devices contain an abusable drug, e.g., an opioid, and its antagonist such that abuse of the opioid is impeded. Thus, for example, illicit use efforts to extract an abusable drug from the transmucosal devices for parenteral injection (e.g., by extraction of the drug by dissolving some or all of the transmucosal device in water or other solvent), are thwarted by the co-extraction of an antagonist. The antagonist is associated with an abuse-resistant matrix. The abuse-resistant matrix can be, but is not limited to a layer or coating, e.g., a water-erodable coating or a water-hydrolysable matrix, e.g., an ion exchange polymer, or any combination thereof. Thus, in one embodiment, the antagonist is associated with the matrix in a manner such that substantial amount is not released in the mouth. In another embodiment, the antagonist is adequately taste masked. The entrapment and/or taste masking may be achieved by physical entrapment by methods, such as microencapsulation, or by chemical binding methods, e.g., by the use of a polymer that prevents or inhibits mucoabsorption of the antagonist, e.g., ion exchange polymers. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the optimum formulation for the particular antagonist may be determined by understanding the ratios needed to prevent abuse, evaluating the possible binding mechanism, and evaluating the physico-chemical properties of the antagonists. In some embodiments, the antagonist is microencapsulated in an enteric polymer, polysaccharide, starch or polyacrylate. Microencapsulation can substantially prevent transmucosal absorption of the antagonist, and allow the subject to swallow the microencapsulated antagonist. The coating of the microcapsules can be designed to offer delayed release characteristics, but will release when the article or composition are placed in an aqueous environment, such as when the dosage form is chewed or subject to extraction. Delayed release can be accomplished, for example, by the use of starches or pH dependent hydrolysis polymers as coating materials for the microencapsulated antagonist. Starches, for example, would be susceptible to any enzymes that are present in the saliva, such as salivary amylase. In some embodiments, the antagonist is microencapsulated in a microcapsule or microsphere and then incorporated in the abuse resistant matrix. Such a microcapsule or microsphere containing antagonist may be comprised of polymers such as polyacrylates, polysaccharides, starch beads, polyactate beads, or liposomes. In a further embodiment, the microspheres and microcapsules are designed to release in specific parts of the small intestine. The amount of antagonist contained in the product can be chosen, for example, to block any psychopharmacological effects that would be expected from parenteral administration of the drug alone. In some embodiments, the abusable drug is fentanyl and the antagonist is naloxone. In some embodiments, the abusable drug is buprenorphine and the antagonist is naloxone. In some embodiments, the antagonist is associated with an abuse-resistant matrix as described herein. In some embodiments, the antagonist associated with an abuse-resistant matrix does not interfere with the transmucosal delivery of the abusable drug.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The antagonist incorporated into the abuse-resistant matrix includes, but is not limited to opiate or opioid antagonists, e.g., naloxone, naltrexone, nalmefene, nalide, nalmexone, nalorphine, naluphine, cyclazocine, levallorphan and physiologically acceptable salts and solvates thereof. In some embodiments, the active agent is naloxone. In one embodiment, the abuse-resistant matrix comprises water soluble polymers, e.g., polymers similar to those described for the mucoadhesive and/or backing layers, but is associated with the device such that the antagonist is not mucosally absorbed to a significant extent. In some embodiments, the abuse-resistant matrix is a layer coating, e.g., a water-erodable coating. That is, physical entrapment of the antagonist in the device, e.g., the mucoadhesive layer, can be facilitated by a barrier layer which is coated with a water soluble polymer which erodes slowly. That is, antagonists may be at least partially coated or disposed within water-erodable coating. Methods of microencapsulation and particle coating have been defined in the literature. In some embodiments, the abuse-resistant matrix includes materials used for physical entrapment. Such materials include, but are not limited to, alginates, polyethylene oxide, poly ethylene glycols, polylactide, polyglycolide, lactide-glycolide copolymers, poly-epsilon-caprolactone, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides and derivatives, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxyethylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, polyacrylic acid, and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, poly vinyl acetate, poly vinyl alcohols, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, ethylene oxide-propylene oxide co-polymers, collagen and derivatives, gelatin, albumin, polyaminoacids and derivatives, polyphosphazenes, polysaccharides and derivatives, chitin, chitosan bioadhesive polymers, polyacrylic acid, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In some embodiments, the devices include an abusable drug and an antagonist that are less susceptible to abuse than an abusable drug alone. For example, when used in an abusive manner, the abusable drug may only retain about 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 2%, 1% or 0% of its efficacy, e.g., as a pain reliever. Accordingly, when used in an abusive manner, it is believed that the effectiveness of the abusable drug, e.g., the ability to produce a âhighâ in an addict, would be reduced by a corresponding amount, e.g., by about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100%.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The abuse-resistant matrix does not effectively release the antagonist when the device is used in a non-abusive manner. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the antagonist associated with an abuse-resistant matrix would not enter systemic circulation through the mucosa in a significant amount because it would be washed into the GI tract, e.g., swallowed. For example, the antagonist may be washed into the GI tract as either free-antagonist or as a coated or otherwise entrapped moiety, e.g., coated/entrapped by an ion-exchange polymer as described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Conventional dosage forms including an opioid and an antagonist, e.g., those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,582,384 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,227,384, typically release the corresponding antagonist into the mucosa along with the opioid even when correctly administered. This impairs the activity of the opioid and it often becomes necessary to increase the quantity thereof required in the dosage form for satisfactory treatment of the patient. In these conventional dosage forms, the risk of undesirable accompanying symptoms is also increased in comparison to dosage forms which contain no opioid antagonists. Moreover, it is desirable not to further increase the stress on the patient by releasing a large proportion of opioid antagonist when such a dosage form is correctly administered.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In some embodiments, the abuse-resistant matrix is a layer or coating, e.g., a water-erodable coating or layer at least partially disposed about the antagonist. In some embodiments, the abuse-resistant matrix is a water-hydrolysable, water-erodable or water-soluble matrix, e.g., an ion exchange polymer. The coating or water-hydrolysable matrix can be chosen such that it dissolves more slowly than a mucoadhesive layer as described above. The coating or water-hydrolysable matrix can additionally or alternatively be chosen such that it dissolves slowly enough not to release the antagonist at all.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The abuse-resistant matrix includes, but is not limited to, partially crosslinked polyacrylic acid, polycarbophil providone cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose, gelatin, chitosan, Amberliteâ¢ 1RP69, Duoliteâ¢ AP143, AMBERLITE 1RP64, AMBERLITE 1RP88, and combinations thereof. In other embodiments, the abuse-resistant matrix includes, but is not limited to, alginates, polyethylene oxide, poly ethylene glycols, polylactide, polyglycolide, lactide-glycolide copolymers, poly-epsilon-caprolactone, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides and derivatives, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxyethylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, polyacrylic acid, and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, poiy vinyl acetate, poly vinyl alcohols, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, ethylene oxide-propylene oxide co-polymers, collagen and derivatives, gelatin, albumin, polyaminoacids and derivatives, polyphosphazenes, polysaccharides and derivatives, chitin, or chitosan bioadhesive polymers, polyacrylic acid, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and combinations thereof. It is to be understood that polymers, layers, coatings, and water-hydrolyzable matrices are exemplary, and that additional abuse-resistant matrices can be envisioned using the teachings of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In some embodiments, the abuse-resistant matrix is incorporated into one or more mucoadhesive layers and/or intermediate layers. In some embodiments, when the device is a multilayer disc or film, the abuse-resistant matrix is a layer or is incorporated into an intermediate layer which is disposed between mucoadhesive layers. In some embodiments, the abuse-resistant matrix is an intermediate layer. In some embodiments, the abuse-resistant matrix erodes at a slower rate than the one or more mucoadhesive layers and/or intermediate layers.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Where the device is abusively dissolved, for example, the antagonist and the abusable drug are released at substantially the same rate. For example, when the antagonist and the abusable drug are dissolved in water, they are both released at substantially the same rate. In other embodiments, the ratio of released antagonist to released drug is not less than about 1:20.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The antagonist incorporated into a device of any of the embodiments discussed herein is substantially transmucosally unavailable. Accordingly, the prescribed transmucosal administration of the drug containing device will not affect the availability of the active agent. The phrase âsubstantially transmucosally unavailableâ refers to the fact that the antagonist in the compositions and devices is available transmucosally in amounts that do not effect, or negligibly effect, the efficacy of the abusable drug when employed in a non-abusive manner. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the antagonist is prevented or slowed from entering the system transmucosally while still being available for other routes of administration (e.g., swallowing or dissolution), thus allowing the abusable drug to act efficaciously in a transmucosal composition, but hindering the use of the composition in an abusive manner. That is, it is to be understood that the antagonist affects the efficacy of the abusable drug when the compositions disclosed herein are abused. In non-abusive situations, the antagonist provides no or negligible effect, e.g., is swallowed. In some embodiments, less than about 25% antagonist (by weight versus abusable drug) can be delivered non-abusively, e.g., transmucosally. In other embodiments, less than about 15%, less than 5%, less than 2%, or less than about 1% antagonist is delivered transmucosally.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Methods are therefore provided for the use of a double-sided mucoadhesive device for the administration of an opioid wherein the device prohibits, discourages or prevents abuse of the incorporated opioid. The antagonist, as described above, acts to suppress the effects of the opioid when consumed by means other than by mucosal administration. In some embodiments, the extent of the absorption into systemic circulation of the antagonist by the subject is less than about 15% by weight. In some embodiments, the dosage of the drug is between about 50 and about 10 mg.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Plasticizers, flavoring and coloring agents, and preservatives may also be included in the outermost mucoadhesive layer or any of the intermediate layers. The amounts of each may vary depending on the drug or other components but typically these components comprise no more than 50%, preferably no more than 30%, most preferably no more than 15% by total weight of the device. In some embodiments, the device includes inactivating agents. In other embodiments, the device is substantially free of inactivating agents. As used herein, the term âinactivating agentâ refers to a compound that inactivates or crosslinks the abusable drug, in order to decrease the abuse potential of the dosage form. Examples of inactivating agents include polymerizing agents, photoinitiators, and formalin. Examples of polymerizing agents include diisocyanates, peroxides, diimides, diols, triols, epoxides, cyanoacrylates, and UV activated monomers.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The devices encompassed by the scope of this disclosure can also optionally include a pharmaceutically acceptable dissolution-rate-modifying agent, a pharmaceutically acceptable disintegration aid (e.g., polyethylene glycol, dextran, polycarbophil, carboxymethyl cellulose, or poloxamers), a pharmaceutically acceptable plasticizer, a pharmaceutically acceptable coloring agent (e.g., FD&amp;C Blue #1), a pharmaceutically acceptable opacifier (e.g., titanium dioxide), pharmaceutically acceptable anti-oxidant (e.g., tocopherol acetate), a pharmaceutically acceptable system forming enhancer (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinyl pyrrolidone), a pharmaceutically acceptable preservative, flavorants (e.g., saccharin and peppermint), neutralizing agents (e.g., sodium hydroxide), buffering agents (e.g., monobasic, or tribasic sodium phosphate), or combinations thereof. Preferably, these components are individually present at no more than about 1% of the final weight of the device, but the amount may vary depending on the other components of the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The devices can also optionally include one or more plasticizers, to soften, increase the toughness, increase the flexibility, improve the molding properties, and/or otherwise modify the properties of the device. Plasticizers for use in the present embodiments can further include, e.g., those plasticizers having a relatively low volatility such as glycerin, propylene glycol, sorbitol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, propylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, butylene glycol, diglycerol, polyethylene glycol (e.g., low molecular weight PEG), oleyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, cetostearyl alcohol, and other pharmaceutical-grade alcohols and diols having boiling points above about 100Â° C. at standard atmospheric pressure. Additional plasticizers include, e.g., polysorbate 80, triethyl titrate, acetyl triethyl titrate, and tributyl titrate. Additional suitable plasticizers include, e.g., diethyl phthalate, butyl phthalyl butyl glycolate, glycerin triacetin, and tributyrin. Additional suitable plasticizers include, e.g., pharmaceutical agent grade hydrocarbons such as mineral oil (e.g., light mineral oil) and petrolatum. Further suitable plasticizers include, e.g., triglycerides such as medium-chain triglyceride, soybean oil, safflower oil, peanut oil, and other pharmaceutical agent grade triglycerides, PEGylated triglycerides such as LabrifilÂ®, LabrasolÂ® and PEG-4 beeswax, lanolin, polyethylene oxide (PEO) and other polyethylene glycols, hydrophobic esters such as ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, cetyl ester wax, glyceryl monolaurate, and glyceryl monostearate.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">One or more disintegration aids can optionally be employed to increase the disintegration rate and shorten the residence time of the subject devices. Disintegration aids useful herein include, e.g., hydrophilic compounds such as water, methanol, ethanol, or low alkyl alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol, acetone, methyl ethyl acetone, alone or in combination. Specific disintegration aids include those having less volatility such as glycerin, propylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">One or more dissolution-rate-modifying agents can optionally be employed to decrease the disintegration rate and lengthen the residence time of the device provided herein. Useful dissolution-rate modifying agents include, e.g., hydrophobic compounds such as heptane, and dichloroethane, polyalkyl esters of di- and tricarboxylic acids such as succinic and citric acid esterified with C<sub>6 </sub>to C<sub>20 </sub>alcohols, aromatic esters such as benzyl benzoate, triacetin, propylene carbonate and other hydrophobic compounds that have similar properties. These compounds can be used alone or in combination in the device. The residence time of the subject device depends on the erosion rate of the water erodable polymers used in the formulation and their respective concentrations. The erosion rate may be adjusted, for example, by mixing together components with different solubility characteristics or chemically different polymers, such as hydroxyethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose; by using different molecular weight grades of the same polymer, such as mixing low and medium molecular weight hydroxyethyl cellulose; by using excipients or plasticizers of various lipophilic values or water solubility characteristics (including essentially insoluble components); by using water soluble organic and inorganic salts; by using crosslinking agents such as glyoxal with polymers such as hydroxyethyl cellulose for partial crosslinking; or by post-treatment irradiation or curing, which may alter the physical state of the film, including its crystallinity or phase transition, once obtained. These strategies might be employed alone or in combination in order to modify the erosion kinetics of the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">In some embodiments, the device is bioerodable. The use of erodable components allows the device to erode over a period of time, with natural bodily fluids dissolving or eroding away the carrier, while the pharmaceutical remains at the application site. Unlike bandages and other non-water-erodable film systems, the user of the instant devices does not have to remove the device following treatment. The user also does not experience any substantial sensation of the presence of a foreign object at the mucosal surface or within the body cavity, given that upon application, water absorption softens the device, and over time, the device slowly dissolves or erodes away. In some embodiments, the device erodes in the oral cavity. In some embodiments, the device does not leave any substantial residue and therefore contributes to a significant decrease in nausea a subject might experience from the administration of other devices. The term âbioerodableâ as used herein refers to a property of a devices that allows a solid or semisolid portion of a device to sufficiently degrade by surface erosion, bioerosion, and/or bulk degradation such that it is small enough to be swallowed without causing system irritations such as nausea. Bulk degradation is the process in which a material, e.g., a polymer, degrades in a fairly uniform manner throughout the matrix. This results in a reduction of molecular weight (Ms) without immediate change in physical properties, followed by fragmentation due to faster penetration of saliva or water into the device than conversion of the device into saliva- or water-soluble form. Bioerosion or surface erosion generally occurs when the rate at which saliva or water penetrates the material is slower than the rate of the conversion of the material into saliva- or water-soluble substances. Bioerosion generally results in a thinning of the material over time, though the bulk integrity is maintained. It is to be understood that âbioerodableâ refers to the device as a whole, and not necessarily to its individual components. For example, if an antagonist is microencapsulated or coated and then incorporated into one of the instant devices, the microcapsules or coating may or may not be bioerodable, but the device as a whole may be bioerodable such that as the device is eroded the intact microcapsules or coated antagonist is swallowed. This can be advantageous because the device may erode and the microcapsules or coated antagonist can be delivered to the GI tract intact, i.e., without crossing the mucosa. The term âbioerodableâ is intended to encompass many modes of material removal, such as enzymatic and non-enzymatic hydrolysis, oxidation, enzymatically-assisted oxidation, wear, degradation and/or dissolution. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that bioerodable devices may be advantageous because such devices do not have to be removed after use.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Bioerodable materials are generally selected on the basis of their degradation characteristics to provide a sufficient residence time or functional lifespan for the particular application. In some devices, a functional lifespan of between about 1 minute and about 10 hours may be suitable. In some embodiments, the functional lifespan is about 20 minutes. In some embodiments, the functional lifespan is about 5 minutes, about 10 minutes, about 15 minutes, about 20 minutes, about 30 minutes, about 45 minutes, about 60 minutes, about 2 hours, about 3 hours, about 4 hours, about 5 hours, or about 10 hours. All ranges and values which fall between the ranges and values listed herein are meant to be encompassed by the present device embodiments disclosed herein. For example, residence times of between about 5 minutes and about 45 minutes, between about 6 minutes and about 53 minutes, between about 13 minutes and about 26 minutes, etc. are all encompassed herein. Shorter or longer periods may also be appropriate.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">Bioerodable materials include, but are not limited to, polymers, copolymers and blends of polyanhydrides (e.g., those made using melt condensation, solution polymerization, or with the use of coupling agents, aromatic acids, aliphatic diacids, amino acids, e.g., asp artic acid and glutamic acid, and copolymers thereof); copolymers of epoxy terminated polymers with acid anhydrides; polyorthoesters; homo- and copolymers of a-hydroxy acids including lactic acid, glycolic acid, -caprolactone, y butyrolactone, and -valerolactone; homo- and copolymers of a-hydroxy alkanoates; polyphosphazenes; polyoxyalkylenes, e.g., where ailcene is 1 to 4 carbons, as homopolymers and copolymers including graft copolymers; poly(amino acids), including pseudo poly(amino acids); polydioxanones; and copolymers of polyethylene glycol with any of the above.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">The present invention also provides for a device that is formed in part from a thin and flexible mucoadhesive film. The device and film are bioerodable. Preparation of the film, in certain aspects, employs water-soluble polymers which include, but are not limited to, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxyethylmethyl cellulose, polyacrylic acid (PAA) which may or may not be partially crosslinked, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), or combinations thereof. Other mucoadhesive bioerodable polymers may also be used in the present invention. The mucoadhesive layer may comprise at least one film-forming water-erodable polymer (the âfilm-forming polymerâ) and at least one pharmacologically acceptable polymer known for its bioadhesive capabilities (the âbioadhesive polymerâ). The film forming polymer may comprise hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, ethylene oxide-propylene oxide co-polymers, collagen and derivatives, gelatin, albumin, polyaminoacids and derivatives, polyphosphazenes, polysaccharides and derivatives, chitin and chitosan, alone or in combination. Preferably, the film-forming polymer comprises hydroxyethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose. Preferably, in the case of hydroxyethyl cellulose, the average molecular weight (Mw estimated from intrinsic viscosity measurements) is in the range 10<sup>2 </sup>to 10<sup>6 </sup>and more preferably in the range 10<sup>3 </sup>to 10<sup>5</sup>, while in the case of hydroxypropyl cellulose, the average molecular weight (Mw obtained from size exclusion chromatography measurements) is in the range 50Ã10<sup>3 </sup>to 1.5Ã10<sup>6</sup>, and more preferably between 80Ã10<sup>3 </sup>to 5Ã10<sup>5</sup>. The ratio of the bioadhesive polymer to the film-forming polymer in the adhesive layer may vary, depending on the type of pharmaceutical and the amount of pharmaceutical to be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">In some embodiments, the intermediate layers are generally comprised of bioerodable, film-forming pharmaceutically acceptable polymers which include, but are not limited to, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxyethylmethyl cellulose, polyvinylalcohol, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, ethylene oxide-propylene oxide co-polymers, or combinations thereof. The intermediate layer may comprise other water-soluble, film-forming polymers as known in the art. Exemplary layers, including polymers suitable for such layers are also described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,800,832 and 6,159,498, the entireties of which are incorporated herein by this reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The devices of the present invention can include various forms. For example, the device can be a disc or film. In one embodiment, the device comprises a mucoadhesive disc. In one embodiment of the methods and devices of the present invention, the device is a flexible device. The thickness of the device of the present invention, in its form as a solid film or disc, may vary depending on the thickness of each of the layers. Typically, the thickness ranges from about 0.005 mm to about 3 mm, and more specifically, from about 0.05 mm to about 0.5 mm. When the device is multi layered, the thickness of each layer can vary from about 10% to about 90% of the overall thickness of the device, and specifically can vary from about 30% to about 60% of the overall thickness of the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">In some embodiments, there is relatively minimal mouth feel and little discomfort because of the thinness and flexibility of the devices as compared to conventional tablet or lozenge devices. This is especially advantageous for patients who have inflammation of the mucosa and/or who may otherwise not be able to comfortably use conventional devices. The devices of the present invention are small and flexible enough so that they can adhere to a non-inflamed area of the mucosa and still be effective, i.e., the mucosa does not need to be swabbed with the device of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">In various embodiments, the devices of the present invention can be in any form or shape such as a sheet or disc, circular or square in profile or cross-section, etc., provided the form allows for the delivery of the active agent to the subject. In some embodiments, the devices of the present invention can be scored, perforated or otherwise marked to delineate certain dosages.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The devices of the present invention can be adapted for any method of mucosal administration. In some embodiments of the invention, methods are provided wherein the device is adapted for buccal administration and/or sublingual administration. In certain methods, the devices provided herein are administered to a subject in need thereof by adhering the device to a mucosal surface. By way of example, the device may be used in methods of treating pain, wherein the device is affixed or adhered to any mucosal surface of a subject wherein the device's two mucoadhesive surfaces may be affixed to two or more mucosal surfaces. The incorporated active agent is delivered transmucosally by diffusion from the device, across the mucoadhesive surface, to the mucosal surface across the mucosal surface and is systemically circulated. Also provided are methods of locally protecting irritated or damaged mucosal tissue by applying the double-sided mucoadhesive devices of the present invention to the irritated or damaged tissue. The active agent may be locally administered and/or systemically administered to the protected site.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">In other aspects, methods for the transmucosal delivery of an active agent to two or more mucosal surfaces are provided using any of the devices discussed herein. The active agent can diffuse from the device to two or more sites of adhesion either simultaneously, substantially simultaneously or sequentially. In certain further embodiments, the diffusion to the points of adhesion is simultaneous. In some embodiments, the method includes applying a device of the invention as described herein to a mucosal cavity of a subject such that there is adhesion of the delivery device to at least two surfaces of the mucosal cavity and diffusion of an active agent across at least two surfaces of the mucosal cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">In some embodiments, the present invention is directed to methods for treating pain in a subject, e.g., a human, with a dosage of an active agent. The methods can employ any of the devices enumerated herein with any of the desired release profiles herein. In some embodiments, the active agent is delivered to the subject in less than about 1 hour, 30 minutes, 20 minutes or 10 minutes. In some embodiments, the active agent is systemically delivered. While not wishing to be bound by a single theory, it is believed that the double-sided mucoadhesive devices of the invention described herein facilitates improved bioavailability of the active agent to the subject due to the multiple points of adhesion that are available with the multiple mucoadhesive surfaces. It may also be found that the typically expected nausea side-effects are diminished. The present invention also provides devices wherein the amount of active agent that can be loaded into the device is substantially greater than with conventional devices. For example, the present invention allows up to about 800 Î¼g, 1000 Î¼g, 1200 Î¼g, 1400 Î¼g or 1600 Î¼g of fentanyl citrate could be loaded into the device. In embodiments wherein the active agent is buprenorphine, the active agent load ranges from 0.01 mg to about 60 mg and more preferably between 0.1 mg and 30 mg.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">Due to the addictive nature of certain opioids used in the treatment of pain, including the opioids contemplated for use in the devices provided herein, it is found that addiction can be moderated by the use of the methods and devices described herein. Accordingly, methods are herein provided for the treatment of addiction to opioids provided herein, by administering an opioid to the subject using any of the devices provided herein. For example, embodiments are provided wherein the double-sided mucoadhesive device includes an abuse-resistant matrix. The abuse resistant matrix prevents, inhibits or discourages abusive use. The abuse-resistant matrix is formulated such that transmucosal administration provides the prescribed amount of the opioid contained therein. However, where an addicted subject would seek to administer more than the prescribed dosage by means such as dissolving the device and injecting the dissolved opioid, the abuse resistant matrix would render the opioid substantially ineffective. Accordingly, potential abuse would be discouraged while prescribed use would be encouraged.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The dual points of adhesion also allows the device to deliver the active agent to the mucosa so as to achieve onset of pain relief in less than about 0.5, 0.3, 0.2, or 0.1 hours. The dual points of adhesion available on a double-sided mucoadhesive device as described herein, allows for the delivery of the active agent directly to the mucosa to achieve a T<sub>max </sub>of less than about 1.75 hours, less than about 1.5 hours, less than about 1.0 hour, less than about 0.5 hours or less than 0.25 hours. In certain embodiments wherein the device contains about 800 Î¼g of fentanyl, the C<sub>max </sub>is about 2.2 ng/mL, 3.2 ng/mL, or 4.2 ng/mL. In some embodiments, the AUC<sub>0-2</sub>, is about 10 hr-ng/mL or about 12.5 hr-ng/mL or about 15 hr-ng/mL. In some embodiments, adherence of the devices of the present invention to the mucosal surface occurs in about five seconds. In some embodiments, the devices of the present invention naturally erode in about twenty to thirty minutes, without any need to hold the device in place. Exemplary embodiments of the present invention encompasses devices wherein the active agent is buprenorphine in the amounts of about 0.1 mg to about 60 mg such that T<sub>max </sub>is less than about 100 minutes, less than about 80 minutes, less than about 60 minutes, less than about 30 minutes or less than about 20 minutes. Where the device contains about 16 mg of buprenorphine, C<sub>max </sub>may be about 8.0 ng/mL. Where the device contains 8 mg of buprenorphine, C<sub>max </sub>may be about 4.5 ng/mL. Where the device contains about 4 mg of buprenorphine, C<sub>max </sub>may be about 2.5 ng/mL.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">The pharmaceutical delivery devices of the present invention may be prepared by various methods known in the art. For example, in one embodiment, the components are dissolved in the appropriate solvent or combination of solvents to prepare a solution. Solvents for use in the present invention may comprise water, methanol, ethanol, or lower alkyl alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol, acetone, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl sulfoxide, or dichloromethane, or any combination thereof. The residual solvent content in the dried, multilayered film may act as a plasticizer, an erosion- or dissolution -rate-modifying agent or may provide some pharmaceutical benefit. Desired residual solvent may reside in the layers.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">A solution is then coated onto a substrate, e.g., cast and processed into a thin film by techniques known in the art, such as film coating, film casting, spin coating, or spraying using the appropriate substrate. The thin film is then dried. The drying step can be accomplished in any type of oven; however, the amount of residual solvent depends on the drying procedure. Where multiple layers are desired, such layers may be filmed independently and then laminated together or may be filmed one on the top of the other. The film obtained after the layers have been laminated together or coated on top of each other may be cut into any type of shape, for application to the mucosal tissue. Some shapes include disks, ellipses, squares, rectangles, and parallepipedes.</p>

      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">An exemplary mucoadhesive device of the present invention will be prepared by adding water (about 89% total formulation, by weight) to a mixing vessel followed by sequential addition of propylene glycol (about 0.5% total formulation, by weight), sodium benzoate (about 0.06% total formulation, by weight), methylparaben (about 0.1% total formulation, by weight) and propylparaben (about 0.03% total formulation, by weight), vitamin E acetate (about 0.01% total formulation, by weight) and citric acid (about 0.06% total formulation, by weight), red iron oxide (about 0.01% total formulation, by weight), and monobasic sodium phosphate (about 0.04% total formulation, by weight). After the components are dispersed and/or dissolved, 800 Î¼g fentanyl citrate (about 0.9% total formulation, by weight) will be added, and the vessel will be heated to about 120 to 130Â° F. After dissolution, the polymer mixture [hydroxypropyl cellulose (Klucel EF, about 0.6% total formulation, by weight), hydroxyethyl cellulose (Natrosol 250L, about 1.9% total formulation, by weight), polycarbophil (Noveon AA1 (about 0.6% total formulation, by weight), and carboxy methyl cellulose (Aqualon 7LF, about 5.124% total formulation, by weight)] will be added to the vessel, and stirred until dispersed. Subsequently, heat will be removed from the mixing vessel. Tribasic sodium phosphate and sodium hydroxide may then be added to adjust the blend to a desired pH. The blend will be mixed under vacuum for a few hours and stored in an air-sealed vessel until its use in the coating operation.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">One or more layers will be cast in series onto a suitable surface, e.g., St. Gobain polyester liner. The blend as prepared above will be cast onto the liner, cured in an oven at about 65Â° C. to 95Â° C., and dried. Additional layers can be cast on top of the initial layer using the same procedure. The devices will then be die-cut, e.g., by kiss-cut method and removed from the casting surface. The devices can be configured, for example, in the form of a disc, rectangular in shape with round corners. Multiple layers may be bonded together such as to avoid delamination during or after application to mucosal surfaces.</p>

      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">The mucoadhesive layer will be prepared by adding water to a mixing vessel followed by sequential addition of propylene glycol, sodium benzoate, methylparaben and propylparaben, vitamin E acetate, citric acid, yellow iron oxide, and monobasic sodium phosphate. After the components are dispersed and/or dissolved, fentanyl or buprenorphine is added, and the vessel is heated to 120 to 130Â° F. The polymer mixtureâhydroxypropyl cellulose (Klucel EF), hydroxyethyl cellulose (Natrosol 250L), polycarbophil (Noveon AA1), and carboxy methyl cellulose (Aqualon 7LF)âwill then be added to the vessel, and stirred until dispersed. Subsequently, heat will be removed from the mixing vessel. As the last addition step, tribasic sodium phosphate (buffering agent) and sodium hydroxide (pH adjusting agent) will be added to adjust the blend to a desired pH. The blend will then be mixed under vacuum for a few hours. The prepared mixture will be stored in an air-sealed vessel until it is ready for use in the coating operation. The % w/w for each ingredient, and any additional ingredients, are illustrated in the following tables (1, 2 and 3). Table 1, represents formulation 1 of the device with buprenorphine, while Table 2 provides the details of formulation 2 containing buprenorphine. Table 3 contains a third formulation containing fentanyl citrate. For formulation 1, the pH ranges from 4.5 to 5.5. For formulation 2, the pH ranges from 5.0 to 6.0.</p>

A first mucoadhesive layer will be cast using a knife-on-a-blade coating method. Subsequently, if desired, a second mucoadhesive layer will be cast onto the first mucoadhesive layer, cured in an oven at about 65 to 95Â° C. and dried. The product can then be die-cut by kiss-cut method and removed from the casting surface.</p>
