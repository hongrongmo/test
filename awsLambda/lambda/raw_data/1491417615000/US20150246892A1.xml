      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to benzodiazepinone compounds useful as Notch inhibitors. The invention further pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound according to the invention that is useful for the treatment of conditions related to the Notch pathway, such as cancer and other proliferative diseases.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Notch signaling has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, such as cell fate specification, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. (Bray, <i>Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology</i>, 7:678-689 (2006); Fortini, <i>Developmental Cell</i>, 16:633-647 (2009)). The Notch proteins are single-pass heterodimeric transmembrane molecules. The Notch family includes 4 receptors, NOTCH 1-4, which become activated upon binding to ligands from the DSL family (Delta-like 1, 3, 4 and Jagged 1 and 2).</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The activation and maturation of NOTCH requires a series of processing steps, including a proteolytic cleavage step mediated by gamma secretase, a multiprotein complex containing Presenilin 1 or Presenilin 2, nicastrin, APH1, and PEN2. Once NOTCH is cleaved, NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD) is released from the membrane. The released NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it functions as a transcriptional activator in concert with CSL family members (RBPSUH, âsuppressor of hairlessâ, and LAG1). NOTCH target genes include HES family members, such as HES-1. HES-1 functions as transcriptional repressors of genes such as HERP1 (also known as HEY2), HERP2 (also known as HEY1), and HATH1 (also known as ATOH1).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The aberrant activation of the Notch pathway contributes to tumorigenesis. Activation of Notch signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various solid tumors including ovarian, pancreatic, as well as breast cancer and hematologic tumors such as leukemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. The role of Notch inhibition and its utility in the treatment of various solid and hematological tumors are described in Miele, L. et al., <i>Current Cancer Drug Targets, </i>6:313-323 (2006); Bolos, V. et al., <i>Endocrine Reviews, </i>28:339-363 (2007); Shih, I-M. et al., <i>Cancer Research, </i>67:1879-1882 (2007); Yamaguchi, N. et al., <i>Cancer Research, </i>68:1881-1888 (2008); Miele, L., <i>Expert Review Anticancer Therapy</i>, 8:1197-1201 (2008); Purow, B., <i>Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology</i>, 10:154-160 (2009); Nefedova, Y. et al., <i>Drug Resistance Updates, </i>11:210-218 (2008); Dufraine, J. et al., <i>Oncogene, </i>27:5132-5137 (2008); and Jun, H. T. et al., <i>Drug Development Research, </i>69, 319-328 (2008).</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">There remains a need for compounds that are useful as Notch inhibitors and that have sufficient metabolic stability to provide efficacious levels of drug exposure. Further, there remains a need for compounds useful as Notch inhibitors that can be orally or intravenously administered to a patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 7,053,084 B1 discloses succinoylamino benzodiazepine compounds useful for treating neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease. The reference discloses that these succinoylamino benzodiazepine compounds inhibit gamma secretase activity and the processing of amyloid precursor protein linked to the formation of neurological deposits of amyloid protein.</p>

The resulting mixture of diastereoisomers may be separated if desired, employing suitable conditions such as preparative HPLC, preparative chiral HPLC or silica gel chromatography, and the resulting pure desired diastereoisomer compound (xii) used in the subsequent steps.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0144">Step 7: The last step of Scheme 3 is a deprotection step and may be accomplished in several ways known to one skilled in the art. For example, for R<sub>w</sub>=benzyl in compound (xii), treatment under hydrogenation conditions using a catalyst such as palladium on carbon in a solvent such as MeOH under a hydrogen atmosphere may provide compound (xi) that may subsequently be utilized, for example, in step 1 of Scheme 4.</p>

      <p id="p-00291-en" num="0334">The Notch-CBF1 (C-promoter binding factor I) cell based transactivation assay is based on the ability of the released Notch intracellular domain fragments (NICDs) to function as transcription factors in conjunction with CBF1 and other nuclear factors. Luciferase assays were used to measure the antagonism of Notch-CBF1 transcriptional activity. HeLa cervical cancer cells are transiently co-transfected with pCDNA3.1/Hygro plasmids containing truncated Notch 1, Notch 2, Notch 3, or Notch 4 receptors and a PGL3 luciferase reporter vector containing 4 copies of CBF1 binding site. The cells were then tested for Notch-CBF1 activity in the absence or presence of test compounds. HeLa cells, maintained in DMEM (high glucose with HEPES), 1Ã glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin and 10% Fetal Bovine serum, were transiently transfected in a T175 Flask (4.5Ã10<sup>6 </sup>cells/flask) using the Monster Transfection Kit (Mirus #MIR2906) according to manufacturers specifications. Table 2 denotes respective DNA quantity for the transfections.</p>

Assay media (5 Î¼L) containing test compounds in final concentrations ranging from 5 Î¼M to 8.4Ã10<sup>â5 </sup>Î¼M (3 fold serial dilutions) were added to the cells and the cell plates were then incubated for 18 hours at 37Â° C. and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Control wells contained DMSO vehicle (total counts) or 0.5 Î¼M of an in-house small molecule inhibitor (background counts). Duplicates were used for each sample. Luciferase activity was measured after a 20-minute incubation with 50 Î¼l STEADY-GLOÂ® luciferase reagents according to manufacturer's specifications (Promega, Cat. #E2550) and analyzed by Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer, Boston, Mass.).</p>
      <p id="p-00294-en" num="0336">The antagonist effect of compounds was expressed as 100Ã[1â(average sampleâaverage background)/(average totalâaverage background)] where sample is the luciferase activity in the presence of test compound, background is equal to the luciferase activity in the presence of the small molecule inhibitor control and the total is signal induced in DMSO wells. Data was plotted using a four parameter logistic fit equation and the IC<sub>50 </sub>value was defined as the concentration of compound that inhibited 50% of the luciferase activity.</p>

      <p id="p-00297-en" num="0338">Compounds administered parenterally enter the blood stream and undergo one or more passes through the liver. Compounds that are not readily metabolized by the liver can be administered at therapeutically effective plasma levels for therapeutically effective periods of time.</p>
      <p id="p-00298-en" num="0339">Orally administered compounds typically are absorbed through the intestinal walls into the blood stream and undergo a first pass through the liver. Compounds that are not readily metabolized in this first pass through the liver can be distributed to other areas of the body in therapeutically effective amounts.</p>
      <p id="p-00299-en" num="0340">The metabolic stability assay evaluated CYP-mediated metabolic stability in vitro using human, rat, mouse, dog, and/or monkey microsomes after a ten-minute incubation. Each compound was tested in duplicate.</p>
      <p id="p-00300-en" num="0341">The results of these assays were expressed as the fraction of parent compound remaining in the reaction mixture after a ten-minute incubation (Percent Remaining). In general, these results were used to evaluate only the extent of CYP-mediated, or NADPH-dependent, metabolism of the test compound. When the compound was significantly metabolized (&lt;40-50% remaining), this indicated high clearance of the compound in vivo due to CYP-mediated metabolism. However, if the compound demonstrated moderate (50-80%) or low (&gt;85%) metabolism in these in vitro assays, high clearance was still possible in vivo via other metabolism and elimination pathways.</p>
      <p id="p-00301-en" num="0342">The percent remaining results of these assays was predictive of compound clearance in vivo, assuming that CYP-mediated metabolism was a predominant elimination pathway. In different microsomal species, the ranges of results were approximately as shown in Table 4.</p>

      <p id="p-00304-en" num="0344">Test compound was received as a 3.5 mM stock solution in 100 percent DMSO. The test compound was diluted to create a 50 Î¼M acetonitrile (ACN) solution containing 1.4% DMSO, which was then used as a 100Ã stock for incubation with microsomes. Each compound was tested in duplicate separately in each of three species in the Metabolic Stability-Human, Rat, and Mouse assay suite or as individual species in the Metabolic Stability-Dog or Metabolic Stability-Monkey suites. Compound, NADPH, and liver microsome solutions were combined for incubation in three steps:</p>
      <p id="p-00305-en" num="0345">1. 152 Î¼l of liver microsome suspension, protein concentration of 1.1 mg/ml in 100 mM NaP<sub>i</sub>, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>buffer, was pre-warmed at 37Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00306-en" num="0346">2. 1.7 Î¼l of 50 Î¼M compound (98.6% ACN, 1.4% DMSO) was added to the same tube and pre-incubated at 37Â° C. for 5 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00307-en" num="0347">3. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 17 Î¼l of pre-warmed 10 mM NADPH solution in 100 mM NaP<sub>i</sub>, pH 7.4.</p>
      <p id="p-00308-en" num="0348">The reaction components were mixed well, and 75 Î¼l of the reaction mixture was immediately transferred into 150 Î¼l quench/stop solution (zero-time point, To). Reactions were incubated at 37Â° C. for 10 minutes and then an additional 75 Î¼l aliquot was transferred into 150 Î¼l quench solution. Acetonitrile containing 100 Î¼M DMN (a UV standard for injection quality control), was used as the quench solution to terminate metabolic reactions.</p>
      <p id="p-00309-en" num="0349">Quenched mixtures were centrifuged at 1500 rpm (Ë500Ãg) in an ALLEGRAÂ® X-12 centrifuge, SX4750 rotor (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, Calif.) for fifteen minutes to pellet denatured microsomes. A volume of 90 Î¼l of supernatant extract, containing the mixture of parent compound and its metabolites, was then transferred to a separate 96-well plate for UV-LC/MS-MS analysis to determine the percent of parent compound that remained in the mixture.</p>

      <p id="p-00313-en" num="0352">The Metabolic Stability structural integrity pre-analysis was used to assess the purity of compounds being assayed. Compounds were received in 96-well plates as 57 Î¼l of a 3.5 mM DMSO solution. The 3.5 mM compound DMSO stock solutions were diluted 18-fold with a solution containing equal volumes of acetonitrile, isopropanol, and MilliQ-H<sub>2</sub>O. The resulting solutions (200 Î¼M) were analyzed for structural integrity by LC-UV/MS on a Thermo LCQ Deca XP Plus ion trap mass spectrometer, using a Waters XBridge C18, 5 Î¼m, 2Ã50 mm column with a Waters Sentry 2.1 mm guard column, and the LC conditions described in the table below, with a 5 Î¼l injection and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The acquired data reflected purity by UV absorbance at 220 nm. Only results for those compounds with purity greater than 50% were reported.</p>

      <p id="p-00315-en" num="0353">MS/MS condition optimization was conducted on a Thermo TSQ QUANTUMÂ® triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a heated-electrospray (H-ESI) source by automated infusion to obtain the SRM transitions and their corresponding collision energy values. Compound solutions at a concentration of 20 Î¼M in 1:1 methanol:water were infused at a flow rate of 90 Î¼L/min, then combined with the mobile phase at a flow rate of 50 Î¼L/min before being introduced into the source. All compounds were optimized first using mobile phase A and B (50% A and 50% B), and if necessary, using mobile phase C and D (also with a 50:50 composition). The optimized parameters, including polarity, SRM transition and collision energy, were stored in a MICROSOFT ACCESSÂ® database.</p>
      <p id="p-00316-en" num="0354">The mass spectrometric conditions obtained from automated infusion were used to analyze incubation samples from the Metabolic Stability assay. The injection volume was 5 Î¼l and the flow rate was 0.8 ml/min. The gradient used was shown in the table below. All samples were injected with the gradient using mobile phase A and B first. If necessary (for instance, for chromatographic reasons), samples were re-injected with the same gradient, but using mobile phase C and D. All LC-MS/MS analysis parameters were captured electronically in the raw data files.</p>

These parameters were useful for predicting in vivo human clearance, which defines the level of drug exposure in vivo (Obach et al, 1997, 1999).</p>
      <p id="p-00322-en" num="0358">The metabolic stability half-life assay panel evaluates the time-course and the rate of CYP-mediated (NADPH-dependent) metabolism in vitro in human, rat, mouse, dog and monkey microsomes. The time course spans a 45-minute incubation, and includes 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 minute time-points, at each of which the amount of test compound remaining in the mixture was measured.</p>
      <heading id="h-00119-en" level="2">Result Interpretation Guideline</heading>
      <p id="p-00323-en" num="0359">The results of the metabolic stability half-life assay are expressed as a half-life (T<sub>1/2</sub>, min). In general, these results should be used to evaluate only the extent of CYP-mediated, or NADPH-dependent, metabolism of the test compound. When the compound was significantly metabolized (T<sub>1/2</sub>&lt;14 minutes), this indicated high clearance in vivo due to CYP-mediated metabolism. However, if the compound demonstrated moderate (14-70 minutes) or low (&gt;70 minutes) metabolism in these in vitro assays, high clearance was still possible in vivo via other metabolism and elimination pathways.</p>
      <p id="p-00324-en" num="0360">The results of these assays were predictive of compound clearance in vivo, assuming that CYP-mediated metabolism was a predominant elimination pathway. In human microsomes, the ranges of results were approximately as shown in the following table:</p>

      <p id="p-00328-en" num="0362">Test compound was received as a 3.5 mM stock solution in 100 percent DMSO. The test compound was diluted to create a 50 Î¼M acetonitrile (ACN) solution containing 1.4% DMSO, which was then used as a 100-fold stock for incubation with microsomes. Each compound was tested in human, rat, mouse, dog and monkey liver microsomes. Compound, NADPH and liver microsome solutions were combined for incubation in three steps:</p>
      <p id="p-00329-en" num="0363">1. 450 Î¼l of liver microsome suspension, protein concentration of 1.1 mg/ml in 100 mM NaP<sub>i</sub>, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>buffer, was pre-warmed at 37Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00330-en" num="0364">2. 5 Î¼l of 50 Î¼M compound (98.6% ACN, 1.4% DMSO) was added to the same tube and pre-incubated at 37Â° C. for 5 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00331-en" num="0365">3. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 Î¼l of pre-warmed 10 mM NADPH solution in 100 mM NaP<sub>i</sub>, pH 7.4.</p>
      <p id="p-00332-en" num="0366">Reaction components were mixed well, and 65 Î¼l were immediately transferred into 130 Î¼l quench/stop solution (zero-time point, T<sub>0</sub>). Reactions were incubated at 37Â° C. for 5, 10, 15, 30 and 45 minutes and at each time-point a 65 Î¼l aliquot was transferred into 130 Î¼l of quench solution. Acetonitrile containing Internal Standard (100 ng/ml), was used as the quench solution to terminate metabolic reactions.</p>
      <p id="p-00333-en" num="0367">Quenched mixtures were centrifuged at 1500 rpm (Ë500Ãg) in an ALLEGRAÂ® X-12 centrifuge, SX4750 rotor (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, Calif.) for fifteen minutes to pellet denatured microsomes. A volume of 90 Î¼l of supernatant extract, containing the mixture of parent compound and its metabolites, was then transferred to a separate 96-well plate for LC/MS-MS analysis to determine the percent of parent compound that was remaining in the mixture.</p>
