    <heading id="h-00005-en">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">However, the techniques of the related art disclosed in Patent Documents 1 to 5 have a problem in the improvement of lubricity.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Recently, as a lubricant used for a surface treatment of a metal member, a lubricant capable of stably exhibiting higher lubricity than that of a lubricant of the related art is required. However, a lubricant satisfying the requirements for high lubricity has yet to be developed.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Further, the techniques of the related art disclosed in Patent Documents 1 to 5 have the following problems.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">When liquid crystal molecules of a lubricant are liquid as in the case of the lubricants disclosed in Patent Documents 1 and 2, this lubricant has a problem in that it cannot be used as a surface treatment agent.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The lubricants disclosed in Patent Documents 3 and 4 contain wax particles. Therefore, during use, it is necessary to prevent precipitation or solidification of the wax particles. Specifically, in order to maintain a dispersed state of the wax particles, it is necessary to continuously stir the lubricants. Therefore, the lubricants disclosed in Patent Documents 3 and 4 have problems not only in lubricity but also in handleability during use.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The lubricant disclosed in Patent Document 5 exhibits lubricity only in a liquid state obtained by phase transition using frictional energy, and thus has certain restrictions in usage conditions and usage environment.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The present invention has been made in consideration of the above-described circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide a surface treatment composition capable of exhibiting high lubricity and a corrosion resistance effect when applied to a metal article.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">As a result of a thorough investigation for solving the above-described problems, the present inventors have found that a surface treatment composition capable of exhibiting high lubricity and a corrosion resistance effect when applied to a metal article can be provided by adopting a configuration containing not only a corrosion inhibitor but also a liquid crystal compound having a branched chain.</p>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">That is, according to the present invention, there is provided a surface treatment composition which forms a coating film on a surface of a metal member by being coated and dried on the surface, the surface treatment composition including: a liquid crystal compound having a branched chain; and a corrosion inhibitor.</p>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Further, according to the present invention, there is provided a method of producing the above-described surface treatment composition, the method comprising: a step of mixing a corrosion inhibitor with a liquid crystal compound having a branched chain.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Further, according to the present invention, there is provided a metal article comprising: a metal member; and a coating film that is formed of the above-described surface treatment composition, in which the coating film is formed on a surface of the metal member by drying the surface treatment composition.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Further, according to the present invention, there is provided a method of producing a metal article including: a step of coating a surface of a metal member with the surface treatment composition; and a step of drying the surface treatment composition to form a coating film.</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">According to the present invention, a surface treatment composition can be provided which is capable of exhibiting high lubricity and a corrosion resistance effect when applied to a metal article.</p>
    <heading id="h-00006-en">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023"> Hereinafter, a surface treatment composition and a metal article according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p>
    <heading id="h-00007-en">(Surface Treatment Composition)</heading>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The surface treatment composition according to the embodiment contains: a liquid crystal compound having a branched chain; and a corrosion inhibitor. This surface treatment composition can form a coating film on a surface of a metal member by being coated and dried on the surface. The fact that the solid coating film can be formed using the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment will be described below.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In addition, the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment can form the solid coating film as mentioned above. Therefore, the metal article having a surface on which the coating film is formed can stably exhibit high lubricity irrespective of usage positions and usage conditions. In addition, since the liquid crystal compound having a branched chain is used, the lubricity can be further improved. In addition, by using the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment, the coating film having a good balance between lubricity and corrosion resistance performance can be formed. In addition, by using the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment, the coating film having not only superior lubricity and corrosion resistance performance but also superior adhesion can be formed.</p>
    <heading id="h-00008-en">(Liquid Crystal Compound)</heading>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">First, the liquid crystal compound contained in the surface treatment composition according to the present invention will be described.</p>

It is considered that, in the molecular structure of the liquid crystal compound, the core portion relates to various properties of the liquid crystal compound such as anisotropy and refractive index. On the other hand, in the molecular structure of the liquid crystal compound, the side chain relates to the crystallinity of the liquid crystal compound. Hereinafter, in the description of the liquid crystal compound contained in the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment, the compound including the core portion and the hydrocarbon group or polar group includes a compound not exhibiting liquid crystal properties, the core portion having two or more ring structures, and the hydrocarbon group or polar group being bonded to both terminals of the core portion.</p>
    <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029"> This liquid crystal compound has a branched chain and thus is easily dissolved in a solvent described below although the reason thereof is not clear.</p>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In addition, according to the embodiment, by using the liquid crystal compound having a branched chain, the lubricity and corrosion resistance performance of the coating film formed using the surface treatment composition can be improved.</p>
    <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In addition, examples of the liquid crystal compound contained in the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment include a compound represented by the following formula (1). ââââââââR<sup>1</sup>-Y<sup>1</sup>-C<sup>1</sup>-A-C<sup>2</sup> -Y<sup>1</sup>-R<sup>1</sup>âââââ(1) wherein <ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>A represents any one of a single bond, -C(=O)-O-, -N=N-, -C(=O)-, -CH=CH-, -Câ¡C-, -O-, -O-, and -CH<sub>2</sub>-,</li><li>C<sup>1</sup> and C<sup>2</sup> each independently represents <chemistry id="chem-00001-en" num="0001"><img id="img-00001-en" wi="154" he="17" img-content="chem" file="EP2940190A1_00001.PNG" img-format="png" original="imgb0001.tif" /></chemistry> (where one of two direct bonds may be bonded to A),</li><li>R<sup>1</sup> represents a branched alkyl group, and</li><li>Y<sup>1</sup> represents any one of -O-, -C(=O)-O-, -O-C(=O)-, -C(=O)-NH-, and -NH-C(=O)-.</li></ul></p>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In the liquid crystal compound represented by the formula (1), it is preferable that Y<sup>1</sup> represents -O- or -C(=O)-O-.</p>
    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In the liquid crystal compound represented by the formula (1), R<sup>1</sup> preferably represents a branched alkyl group having equal to or more than 3 and equal to or less than 22 carbon atoms, and more preferably a branched alkyl group having equal to or more than 5 and equal to or less than 18 carbon atoms. As a result, when the solid coating film is formed using the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment, the solid coating film having higher lubricity and a corrosion resistance effect can be obtained. In addition, it is preferable that R<sup>1</sup> has one or more branched chains.</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The liquid crystal compound is not particularly limited, but for example, is preferably formed of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of 4,4'-di-2-ethyl hexyloxy-1,1'-biphenyl represented by the following formula (A1), 4,4'-di-3-ethyl hexyloxy-1,1'-biphenyl represented by the following formula (A2), 4,4'-di-2-methyl heptyloxy-1,1'-biphenyl represented by the following formula (A3), 4,4'-di-3-methyl heptyloxy-1,1'-biphenyl represented by the following formula (A4), 4,4'-di-4-methyl heptyloxy-1,1'-biphenyl represented by the following formula (A5), 4,4'-di-5-methyl heptyloxy-1,1'-biphenyl represented by the following formula (A6), 4,4'-di-2-ethyl octyloxy-1,1'-biphenyl represented by the following formula (A7), 4,4'-di-3-ethyloctyloxy-1,1'-biphenyl represented by the following formula (A8), 4,4'-di-3-n-propylheptyloxy-1,1'-biphenyl represented by the following formula (A9), 4,4'-di-3-n-propyl nonyloxy-1,1'-biphenyl represented by the following formula (A10), 4,4'-di-3-ethyl-6-methyl nonyloxy-1,1'-biphenyl represented by the following formula (A11), and 4,4'-di-2-methyl hexadecyloxyl-1,1'-biphenyl represented by the following formula (A12).

    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">In addition, the liquid crystal compound having a branched chain has a content of, preferably equal to or more than 0.01 wt% and equal to or less than 30.0 wt% and more preferably equal to or more than 0.1 wt% and equal to or less than 15.0 wt% with respect to the total amount of the corrosion inhibitor. As a result, by using the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment, the solid coating film exhibiting higher lubricity and having a corrosion resistance effect can be formed.</p>
    <heading id="h-00009-en">&lt;Corrosion Inhibitor&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The corrosion inhibitor used in the surface treatment composition according to the present invention is not particularly limited, and for example, an alkoxysilane oligomer is preferably used. As a result, using an interaction between the corrosion inhibitor and the liquid crystal compound having a branched chain, higher lubricity can be imparted to the formed solid coating film. In addition, the corrosion inhibitor may have a coating film-forming function. That is, the corrosion inhibitor may function as a coating film-forming agent having a corrosion resistance effect. Examples of the coating film-forming agent include an alkoxysilane oligomer.</p>
    <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The alkoxysilane oligomer can be polycondensed to have linear molecules when synthesized using an acid catalyst such as hydrochloric acid and can be formed as a bulk gel when synthesized using a basic catalyst. It is preferable that the weight average molecular weight of the alkoxysilane oligomer is large to some extent from the viewpoints of the corrosion resistance performance and an anti-cracking function of the coating film and the storage properties of the corrosion inhibitor. Specifically, the weight average molecular weight of the alkoxysilane oligomer according to the embodiment is preferably equal to or more than 1000 and equal to or less than 10000 and more preferably equal to or more than 2000 and equal to or less than 5000. As a result, the solid coating film having superior film forming properties and corrosion resistance performance can be formed.</p>
    <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038"> In addition, when a material containing an alkoxysilane oligomer is used as the corrosion inhibitor, the coating film having higher corrosion resistance performance can be formed. Further, when an alkoxysilane oligomer having a portion of silicon in the oligomer molecules substituted with titanium is used as the alkoxysilane oligomer, the adhesion of the coating film on a surface of a metal member can be improved. As a result, even when the coating film is cracked, the coating film can be prevented from being peeled off from the metal member.</p>
    <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Meanwhile, the alkoxysilane oligomer having a portion of silicon substituted with titanium can be synthesized by adding a small amount of an acid catalyst such as hydrochloric acid and water to an alcohol solution containing alkoxysilane materials and titanium alkoxide, and hydrolyzing the solution to be polycondensed. However, when highly reactive titanium alkoxide is rapidly hydrolyzed, precipitation occurs. Therefore, it is preferable that, before mixing titanium alkoxide with the alkoxysilane materials in the alcohol solution and polycondensing the mixture, 40% to 60% of alkoxy groups in titanium alkoxide are blocked or substituted with a chelating agent to reduce the reaction activity of titanium alkoxide.</p>
    <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In addition, in the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment, in order to form the coating film having a thickness capable of obtaining a practical level of corrosion resistance performance on a surface of a metal member, the total content of silicon and titanium in the alcohol solution of the alkoxysilane oligomer containing a titanium component is preferably 5 wt% to 20 wt% and more preferably 7 wt% to 15 wt% in terms of SiO<sub>2</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub>, respectively.</p>
    <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In addition, when introduced into the alkoxysilane oligomer, an alkoxysilane monomer having an organic group directly bonded to silicon forms an alkoxysilane oligomer having a state where the organic group is bonded to a portion of silicon. Due to the presence of the organic group bonded to silicon, the coating film formed on the surface of the metal member can be made to be soft, and an effect of preventing the coating film from being cracked can be obtained. The alkoxysilane monomer is not particularly limited, but for example, is at least one compound selected from the group consisting of methyltrimethoxysilane, methyltriethoxysilane, ethyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, and Î³-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane which are less likely to decrease corrosion resistance performance. Among these, vinyltrimethoxysilane is preferably used. As a result, the coating film can be prevented from being cracked, and the corrosion resistance performance can be made to be superior during practical use.</p>
    <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">It is preferable that the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment contains a solvent. When the surface treatment composition contains a solvent, the liquid crystal compound having a branched chain is dissolved or uniformly dispersed in the solvent. As a result, unlike the lubricant containing wax described above in "DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION", it is not necessary to continuously stir the surface treatment composition. In addition, by dissolving or uniformly dispersing the liquid crystal compound in the solvent, the liquid crystal compound having a branched chain and the corrosion inhibitor can be uniformly mixed using a simple method. Therefore, an interaction between the liquid crystal compound having a branched chain and the corrosion inhibitor is likely to occur, and the solid coating film exhibiting higher lubricity and having a corrosion resistance effect can be formed. The liquid crystal compound according to the embodiment has a branched chain and thus is easily dissolved in the solvent. Therefore, unlike the waxes described above in Patent Documents 3 and 4, the liquid crystal compound according to the embodiment is not precipitated and solidified in the solvent even when uniformly dispersed in the solvent.</p>
    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">It is preferable that the solvent contains an alcohol. As a result, the solubility of the liquid crystal compound in the solvent can be improved.</p>
    <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The alcohol is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include isopropyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, n-butanol, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol-t-butoxide, ethyl alcohol, and glycol ether. Among these, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol-t-butoxide, n-propyl alcohol, or n-butanol is preferable, and isopropyl alcohol is more preferable. By the solvent containing the alcohol, the solubility of the liquid crystal compound in the solvent is further improved.</p>
    <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In addition, in the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment, the coating film having a non-liquid-crystal structure which is optically isotropic can be formed. The reason will be described below.</p>
    <heading id="h-00010-en">(Method of Producing Surface Treatment Composition)</heading>
    <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">A method of producing the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment includes a step of mixing a corrosion inhibitor with a liquid crystal compound having a branched chain. As described above, the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment exhibits the interaction between the liquid crystal compound having a branched chain and the corrosion inhibitor. In addition, in the method of producing the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment, it is preferable that, during the mixing of the liquid crystal compound having a branched chain with the corrosion inhibitor, the liquid crystal compound is dissolved or dispersed in the solvent while mixing with the solvent.</p>
    <heading id="h-00011-en">(Metal Article)</heading>
    <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The metal article according to the embodiment includes: a metal member; and a coating film that is formed on a surface of the metal member using the surface treatment composition. This coating film is formed by drying the surface treatment composition. As a result, the metal article having corrosion resistance performance and high lubricity can be obtained.</p>
    <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">This surface treatment composition containing the liquid crystal compound having a branched chain and the corrosion inhibitor can form the solid coating film on the surface of the metal member by being coated and dried on the surface. The reason is considered to be that, although the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment contains the liquid crystal compound, the entire amount of the liquid crystal compound is solidified after drying. Specifically, when dried, the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment forms the appropriately soft coating film without losing adhesion with the metal member. In addition, according to the embodiment, the liquid crystal compound has a branched chain and thus can impart high lubricity while maintaining the performance as the corrosion inhibitor.</p>
    <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In addition, the reason why the metal article according to the embodiment has high lubricity is not necessarily clear but is presumed to be as follows: when the coating film is formed using the liquid crystal compound having a branched chain as a side chain in the molecular structure, the frictional coefficient of the metal article including the coating film is reduced by aggregation of branched chains present in the coating film.</p>
    <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In addition, it is preferable that the coating film which is formed using the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment forms a non-liquid-crystal structure which is optically isotropic. According to the technical level of the related art, the formation of a coating film which is optically anisotropic is preferable. However, according to the embodiment, it can be clearly seen that higher lubricity can be exhibited by forming the coating film having the non-liquid-crystal structure which is optically isotropic. Further, according to the embodiment, it is considered that, since the branched chain is present in the molecular structure of the liquid crystal compound, the orientation between liquid crystal molecules is lost, and the coating film cannot be anisotropic. The reason why the coating film forms the non-liquid-crystal structure which is optically isotropic is not necessarily clear but is presumed to be as follows: since the liquid crystal compound having a branched chain is used, the orientation between molecules in the coating film is disturbed, and the coating film cannot be anisotropic.</p>
    <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">When the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment is coated and dried on the metal member, the formation of the non-liquid-crystal structure which is optically isotropic can be verified using the following method. The verification can be made by interposing the coating film, which is obtained by drying the surface treatment composition, between polarizing plates and irradiating the coating film with light in a plane direction of the polarizing plates. When the coating film obtained by drying the surface treatment composition has the non-liquid-crystal structure, the light does not pass through the coating film. On the other hand, when the coating film obtained by drying the surface treatment composition has a liquid crystal structure which is optically anisotropic, the light passes through the coating film.</p>
    <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In addition, the thickness of the coating film which is formed using the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment is preferably equal to or more than 0.1 Âµm and equal to or less than 3.0 Âµm and more preferably equal to or more than 0.5 Âµm and equal to or less than 2.0 Âµm. As a result, lubricity required by a client can be sufficiently imparted to the metal article, the amount of the surface treatment composition coated on the surface of the metal article can be suppressed, and plural functions can be imparted at the same time. Therefore, the above-described thickness range is preferable from the viewpoint of cost. Further, when the thickness of the coating film is in the above-described range, a practical corrosion resistance performance can be exhibited, and the coating film capable of preventing cracking and peeling can be formed.</p>
    <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">In addition, the overall frictional coefficient of the metal article according to the embodiment is preferably equal to or more than 0.030 and equal to or less than 0.500 and more preferably equal to or more than 0.050 and equal to or less than 0.300. As a result, the metal article having higher lubricity can be obtained. The overall frictional coefficient according to the embodiment can be measured and calculated according to JIS B 1084 by using the metal article as a specimen.</p>
    <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In addition, it is preferable that the surface of the metal member is formed of one material of zinc, a zinc alloy, iron, stainless steel, aluminum, and brass.</p>
    <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In addition, the metal member according to the embodiment is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include a bolt and a screw. When a small-sized metal member such as a bolt or a screw is used, there is an advantageous effect in that the surface of the metal member is easily coated with the surface treatment composition.</p>
    <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In addition, it is preferable that the metal article according to the embodiment is a metal-plated product obtained by metal plating or a metal-coated product obtained by metal flake coating. In addition, the metal-plated product is preferably a product plated with zinc or a zinc alloy, and the metal-coated product is preferably a product coated with a zinc-aluminum composite coating material. As a result, the peeling and cracking of the formed coating film can be prevented.</p>
    <heading id="h-00012-en">(Method of Producing Metal Article)</heading>
    <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">A method of producing the metal article according to the embodiment includes: a step of coating a surface of a metal member with the surface treatment composition; and a step of drying the surface treatment composition to form a coating film.</p>
    <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">In addition, in the step of forming the coating film according to the embodiment, a temperature at which the surface treatment composition is dried is preferably equal to or higher than 25Â°C and equal to or lower than 200Â°C and more preferably equal to or higher than 80Â°C and equal to or lower than 120Â°C. As a result, the orientation of the liquid crystal compound contained in the surface treatment composition can be controlled.</p>
    <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Hereinafter, a method of forming the coating film on the surface of the metal member will be specifically described. However, the film forming method according to the embodiment is not limited to the following description.</p>
    <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">For example, when a small-sized metal member such as a bolt or a screw is used, for example, a dip and spin coating method is preferably used. When this method is used, the coating film having higher lubricity can be formed on a metal member plated with zinc or a metal member coated with a zinc-aluminum composite coating material.</p>
    <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Here, the dip and spin coating method refers to a method including: dipping a metal member in a solution containing the surface treatment composition; pulling the metal member out from the solution; and spinning the obtained metal member using a centrifugal separator to throw off the remaining surface treatment composition attached to the surface of the metal member. In this way, the metal member is coated with the surface treatment composition and then is heated and dried. As a result, the solid coating film can be formed.</p>
    <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">As a method of coating the surface treatment composition according to the embodiment, an appropriate method corresponding to the size and shape of the metal member is preferably used. In addition to the dip and spin coating method, for example, a method using a roll coater, a dip drain method, and a method of removing the remaining surface treatment composition using a roll or a brush are used.</p>
