      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2014-44442, filed Mar. 6, 2014. The contents of this application are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to a pattern-forming method and a directed self-assembling composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Miniaturization of various types of electronic device structures such as semiconductor devices and liquid crystal devices has been accompanied by demands for microfabrication of patterns in lithography processes. In these days, although fine patterns having a line width of about 50 nm can be formed using, for example, an ArF excimer laser beam, further finer pattern formation has been required.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">To meet the demands described above, a pattern-forming method which utilizes a phase separation structure formed by the directed self-assembly, as generally referred to, that spontaneously forms an ordered pattern have been proposed. For example, an ultrafine pattern-forming method by directed self-assembly has been known in which a block copolymer obtained by copolymerizing a monomer compound having one property with a monomer compound having a property that is distinct from the one property is involved (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. 2008-149447, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application (Translation of PCT Application), Publication No. 2002-519728 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. 2003-218383). According to this method, annealing of a film formed from a composition containing the block copolymer results in a tendency of clustering of polymer structures having the same property, and thus a pattern can be formed in a self-aligning manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">However, patterns obtained by utilizing the phase separation structure formed by such directed self-assembly are not deemed to be yet sufficiently fine, and additionally have drawbacks such as significant variations of a pattern size; therefore an improvement thereof has been demanded. As one of methods for achieving such an improvement, it is known that when a coating film of a directed self-assembling composition is provided on other film (hereinafter, may be also referred to as âunderlayer filmâ), the abovementioned phase separation through the directed self-assembly may effectively occur, and materials and the like for the underlayer film have been investigated (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication Nos. 2008-36491 and 2012-174984).</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">According to one aspect of the present invention, a pattern-forming method includes providing a coating film using a composition that includes: a first polymer which is a block copolymer; and a second polymer having a surface free energy lower than a surface free energy of the first polymer, such that the second polymer is unevenly distributed to be localized into a superficial layer region of the coating film. Phase separation is caused in the coating film along a direction substantially perpendicular to a thickness direction of the coating film such that at least a part of the coating film is converted into a directed self-assembling film which includes a plurality of phases. A part of the plurality of phases of the directed self-assembling film is removed.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">According to another aspect of the present invention, a directed self-assembling composition includes a block copolymer, and a polymer having a surface free energy lower than a surface free energy of the block copolymer.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="2">Pattern-Forming Method</heading>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">A pattern-forming method according to an embodiment of the present invention includes:</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">providing a coating film using a composition that contains the block copolymer (A), and the polymer (B) (hereinafter, may be also referred to as âdirected self-assembling composition (I)â), such that the polymer (B) is unevenly distributed to be localized into a superficial layer region of the coating film (hereinafter, may be also referred to as âcoating film-providing stepâ);</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">converting at least a part of the coating film into a directed self-assembling film by causing phase separation in the coating film along a substantially perpendicular direction (hereinafter, may be also referred to as âdirected self-assembling stepâ); and</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">removing a part of a plurality of phases of the directed self-assembling film (hereinafter, may be also referred to as âremoving stepâ).</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">It is preferred that the pattern-forming method further includes providing an underlayer film on a substrate (hereinafter, may be also referred to as âunderlayer film-providing stepâ) before the coating film-providing step, and that in the coating film-providing step, the coating film is provided on the underlayer film.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">It is also preferred that the pattern-forming method further includes forming a prepattern (hereinafter, may be also referred to as âprepattern-forming stepâ) before the coating film-providing step, and that in the coating film-providing step, the coating film is provided in a region compartmentalized by the prepattern.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The terms âdirected self assemblyâ and âdirected self-assemblingâ as referred to means a phenomenon of spontaneously constructing a tissue or a structure without resulting from only the control from an external factor. In the embodiment of the present invention, a film having a phase separation structure formed by directed self-assembly (directed self-assembling film) is provided from the directed self-assembling composition (I), and a part of a plurality of phases of the directed self-assembling film is removed, whereby a pattern can be formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Hereinafter, each step will be explained with reference to <figref>FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">Underlayer Film-Providing Step</heading>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In this step, an underlayer film is provided on a substrate. Thus, an underlayer film-bearing substrate in which an underlayer film <b>102</b> is provided on the substrate <b>101</b> can be obtained, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, and the coating film <b>104</b> is provided on the underlayer film <b>102</b>. The phase separation structure formed by the phase separation of at least a part of the coating film <b>104</b> (microdomain structure) is altered by not only an interaction between blocks of the block copolymer (A) contained in the directed self-assembling composition (I), but also an interaction with the underlayer film <b>102</b>; therefore, the structure may be more easily controlled by virtue of having the underlayer film <b>102</b>. Furthermore, when the coating film <b>104</b> is thin, a transfer process thereof can be improved owing to having the underlayer film <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">As the substrate <b>101</b>, for example, a conventionally well-known substrate, e.g., a silicon wafer, a wafer coated with aluminum or the like may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Moreover, as a composition for forming an underlayer film for use in providing the underlayer film, a conventionally well-known material for forming an organic underlayer film, and the like may be used, and examples thereof include compositions for forming an underlayer film which contain a crosslinking agent, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Although the procedure for providing the underlayer film <b>102</b> is not particularly limited, an exemplary procedure may involve, for example, applying the composition for forming an underlayer film to the substrate <b>101</b> through a well-known method such as a spin coating method, followed by an exposure and/or heating to permit curing of the composition for forming an underlayer film, and the like. Examples of the radioactive ray which may be employed for the exposure include visible light rays, ultraviolet rays, far ultraviolet rays, X-rays, electron beams, Î³-rays, molecular beams, ion beams, and the like. Moreover, the temperature employed in the heating is not particularly limited, and is preferably 90Â° C. to 550Â° C., more preferably 90Â° C. to 450Â° C., and still more preferably 90Â° C. to 300Â° C. The film thickness of the underlayer film <b>102</b> is not particularly limited, and is preferably 30 nm to 20,000 nm, more preferably 40 nm to 1,000 nm, and still more preferably 50 nm to 500 nm. In addition, the underlayer film <b>102</b> preferably includes an SOC (Spin on Carbon) film.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">Prepattern-Forming Step</heading>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In this step, a prepattern is formed. This prepattern may be formed on the substrate, or may be formed on the underlayer film <b>101</b> provided in the underlayer film-providing step as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. The prepattern <b>103</b> enables a configuration of the phase separation structure formed by the directed self-assembly in the coating film <b>104</b> to be controlled, and thus a finer pattern can be formed. More specifically, among the blocks included in the block copolymer (A) contained in the directed self-assembling composition (I), a block having a higher affinity to a lateral face of the prepattern (hereinafter, may be also referred to as âblock (I)â) forms phases <b>105</b><i>b </i>along the prepattern, whereas a block having a lower affinity (hereinafter, may be also referred to as âblock (II)â) forms phases <b>105</b><i>a </i>at positions away from the prepattern. Thus, a finer and more favorable pattern can be formed. In addition, according to the material, size, shape, etc. of the prepattern, the structure of the pattern formed through phase separation of the directed self-assembling composition (I) can be more minutely controlled. It is to be noted that the prepattern <b>103</b> may be appropriately selected depending on the pattern intended to be finally formed, and, for example, a line-and-space pattern, a hole pattern or the like may be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">As the method for forming the prepattern <b>103</b>, methods similar to well-known resist pattern-forming methods, and the like may be used. In addition, a conventional resist composition such as a composition that contains a polymer including an acid-labile group, a radiation-sensitive acid generating agent and an organic solvent may be used as the composition for use in forming the prepattern <b>103</b>. Specifically, for example, a commercially available chemical amplification resist composition is applied to the substrate <b>101</b> or the underlayer film <b>102</b> to provide a resist film. Next, an exposure is carried out by irradiating a desired region of the resist film with a radioactive ray through a mask having a specific pattern. Examples of the radioactive ray include: electromagnetic waves such as ultraviolet rays, far ultraviolet rays and X-rays; charged particle rays such as electron beams and Î±-rays; and the like. Of these, far ultraviolet rays are preferred, ArF excimer laser beams and KrF excimer lasers are more preferred, and ArF excimer laser beams are still more preferred. Also, the exposure may employ a liquid immersion medium. Subsequently, post exposure baking (PEB) may be carried out, followed by development using a developer solution such as an alkaline developer solution and an organic solvent, whereby a desired prepattern <b>103</b> can be formed. In the resulting prepattern <b>103</b>, it is preferred that curing thereof is accelerated by irradiation with an ultraviolet ray of, for example, 254 nm, followed by a heating treatment at 100Â° C. to 200Â° C. for 1 min to for 30 min.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">It is to be noted that the surface of the prepattern <b>103</b> may be subjected to a hydrophobilization treatment or a hydrophilization treatment. As a specific treatment method, a hydrogenation treatment including exposing to hydrogen plasma for a certain time period, and the like may be exemplified. An increase of the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of the surface of the prepattern <b>103</b> enables the directed self-assembly in the coating film <b>104</b> to be further accelerated.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="2">Coating Film-Providing Step</heading>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In this step, a coating film in which the polymer (B) is unevenly distributed to be localized into a superficial layer region is provided using the directed self-assembling composition (I). The directed self-assembling composition (I) will be described later. In a case where the coating film is provided in a region compartmentalized by the prepattern <b>103</b> on the underlayer film <b>102</b>, a coating film <b>104</b> is provided, and the polymer (B) is unevenly distributed to be localized into a superficial layer region <b>104</b><i>b </i>of the coating film, as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. Even in a case where the underlayer film and/or the prepattern are/is not used, the coating film can be provided. Since the polymer (B) contained in the directed self-assembling composition (I) has a lower surface free energy than that of the block copolymer (A), the polymer (B) is unevenly distributed to be localized into the superficial layer region <b>104</b><i>b </i>of the coating film <b>104</b> in the process of the formation of the coating film <b>104</b> using the directed self-assembling composition (I). In other words, the coating film <b>104</b> is constitution with the superficial layer region <b>104</b><i>b </i>containing the polymer (B) as a principal component, and a region <b>104</b><i>a </i>which is other than the superficial layer region <b>104</b><i>b </i>and contains the block copolymer (A) as a principal component.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The coating film <b>104</b> is typically provided by applying the directed self-assembling composition (I). Although the application method is not particularly limited, examples thereof include a spin coating procedure. In a case where the underlayer film <b>102</b> and the prepattern <b>103</b> are used, the region compartmentalized by the prepattern <b>103</b> on the underlayer film <b>102</b> is filled with the directed self-assembling composition (I), whereby the coating film <b>104</b> is provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">When a compound having a relative permittivity of no less than 20 and no greater than 75, and a boiling point of no less than 180Â° C. and no greater than 300Â° C. at 1 atm as described later, is contained in the solvent contained in the directed self-assembling composition (I), the uneven distribution of the polymer (B) described above can be accelerated, whereby the microfabrication of a pattern obtained by the pattern-forming method may be further enhanced, or the amount of the polymer (B) used may be reduced.</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="2">Directed Self-Assembling Step</heading>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In this step, at least a part of the coating film provided in the coating film-providing step is converted into a directed self-assembling film by causing phase separation in the coating film along a substantially perpendicular direction. In the directed self-assembling step, for example, phase separation occurs along a substantially perpendicular direction in the region <b>104</b><i>a </i>other than the superficial layer region shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, which is a part of the coating film <b>104</b> to form a directed self-assembling film <b>105</b> having phases <b>105</b><i>a </i>constituted with blocks (II) of the block copolymer (A) and phases <b>105</b><i>b </i>constituted with blocks (I), as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. In this instance, the directed self-assembling film <b>105</b> formed is constituted with the block copolymer (A). More specifically, blocks having identical properties are assembled with one another to spontaneously form an ordered pattern to cause phase separation along a substantially perpendicular direction, whereby the directed self-assembling film <b>105</b> is formed. In the course of the directed self-assembling step, the region <b>104</b><i>a </i>in which the directed self-assembly takes place, other than the superficial layer region is adjacent to the superficial layer region <b>104</b><i>b</i>, and the phase separation may easily occur in the formation of the directed self-assembling film <b>105</b> due to an interaction of the polymer (B) constituting the superficial layer region <b>104</b><i>b </i>with the block copolymer (A) constituting the region <b>104</b><i>a </i>other than the superficial layer region. Consequently, the directed self-assembling film <b>105</b> accompanied by favorable phase separation is formed. Although not necessarily clarified, the reason for achieving favorable phase separation described above is presumed as in the following, for example. In the case of not applying the polymer (B), phase separation tends to be accelerated in a substantially horizontal direction due to a large difference in terms of surface free energy between ambient air and the block copolymer (A). On the other hand, in the case of applying the polymer (B), the polymer (B) is unevenly distributed to be localized into the superficial layer region of the coating film of the directed self-assembling composition (I), leading to a decrease of the difference in terms of surface free energy between ambient air and the block copolymer (A). Thus, the phase separation in the substantially horizontal direction is inhibited, and consequently a phase separation effectively occurs along a substantially perpendicular direction.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Examples of the procedure for converting the coating film into a directed self-assembling film through phase separation include annealing, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The annealing process may include, for example, heating at a temperature of typically 80Â° C. to 400Â° C., more preferably 100Â° C. to 350Â° C., and still more preferably 150Â° C. to 300Â° C. in an oven, on a hot plate, etc., and the like. The annealing time period is typically 1 min to 120 min, preferably 2 min to 90 min, and more preferably 3 min to 60 min. The film thickness of the directed self-assembling film <b>105</b> thus obtained is preferably 0.1 nm to 500 nm, more preferably 0.5 nm to 100 nm, and still more preferably 1 nm to 60 nm.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">When the prepattern <b>103</b> described above is employed, the phase separation structure is preferably formed along the prepattern, and the phase boundaries formed by the phase separation are more preferably substantially parallel to a lateral face of the prepattern. For example, in a block copolymer (A) constituted with a polystyrene block and a poly(meth)acrylic acid ester block, in a case where the prepattern <b>103</b> has a higher affinity to the polystyrene block of the block copolymer (A), a phase (<b>105</b><i>b</i>) of the polystyrene block is linearly formed along the prepattern <b>103</b>, and adjacent to the phase (<b>105</b><i>b</i>), a phase (<b>105</b><i>a</i>) of the poly(meth)acrylic acid ester block and the phase (<b>105</b><i>b</i>) of the polystyrene block are alternately arranged in this order to form a lamellar phase separation structure, or the like. It is to be noted that the phase separation structure formed in this step is constituted with a plurality of phases, and typically the phase boundaries formed by these phases are substantially perpendicular to the substrate; however, the phase boundaries per se may not necessarily be clear. In addition, the resultant phase separation structure can be strictly controlled by way of a ratio of the length of each block (polystyrene block, poly(meth)acrylic acid ester block, etc.) in molecules of the block copolymer (A), the length of the molecule of the block copolymer (A) (weight average molecular weight, etc.), the underlayer film, the prepattern and the like, and thus, a directed self-assembling film having a phase separation structure such as a sea-island structure, a cylinder structure, a co-interconnected or a lamellar structure can be formed; consequently, a desired fine pattern can be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In the pattern-forming method, a further finer pattern can also be obtained by not only providing the superficial layer region <b>104</b><i>b </i>described above, contrary to the region <b>104</b><i>a </i>in which the directed self-assembly takes place, other than the superficial layer region so as to exhibit an interaction therebetween, but also forming the underlayer film <b>102</b> and/or the prepattern <b>103</b> described above such that an interaction thereof also has an effect on the directed self-assembly.</p>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="2">Removing Step</heading>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In this step, a part of a plurality of phases of the directed self-assembling film are removed.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">According to this step, for example, a part of a plurality of block phases <b>105</b><i>a </i>of the phase separation structure included in the directed self-assembling film <b>105</b> are removed, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. Thus, a part of the plurality of phases <b>105</b><i>a </i>can be removed through an etching treatment by utilizing, for example, the difference of an etching rate of each phase separated through the directed self-assembly. The superficial layer region <b>104</b><i>b </i>and/or the prepattern <b>103</b> each not included in the directed self-assembling film <b>105</b> can be also removed concurrently with or separately from the part of the plurality of phases. A state after removing a part of the plurality of phases <b>105</b><i>a </i>of the phase separation structure, the superficial layer region <b>104</b><i>b </i>and the prepattern <b>103</b> as described later, is shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. It is to be noted that prior to the etching treatment, irradiation with a radioactive ray may be conducted as needed. As the radioactive ray, in a case where the phases to be removed by etching are phases of the polymethyl methacrylate block, a radioactive ray of 254 nm may be used. The irradiation with the radioactive ray results in decomposition of the phases of the polymethyl methacrylate block, whereby the etching can be facilitated.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">As the procedure for removing a part of the plurality of phases of the phase separation structure included in the directed self-assembling film <b>105</b>, well-known procedures e.g., reactive ion etching (RIE) such as chemical dry etching and chemical wet etching; physical etching such as sputter etching and ion beam etching; and the like may be exemplified. Of these, reactive ion etching (RIE) is preferred, and in particular, chemical dry etching carried out by using a CF<sub>4 </sub>gas, an O<sub>2 </sub>gas or the like, and chemical wet etching (wet development) carried out by using an etching liquid, i.e., an organic solvent, or a liquid such as hydrofluoric acid are more preferred. Examples of the organic solvent include: alkanes such as n-pentane, n-hexane and n-heptane; cycloalkanes such as cyclohexane, cycloheptane and cyclooctane; saturated carboxylic acid esters such as ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, i-butyl acetate and methyl propionate; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and methyl n-pentyl ketone; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol and 4-methyl-2-pentanol; and the like. It is to be noted that these solvents may be used either alone, or two or more types thereof may be used in combination.</p>
      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="2">Prepattern-Removing Step</heading>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In this step, the prepattern <b>103</b> is removed, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. Removal of the prepattern <b>103</b> enables a finer and complicated pattern to be formed. It is to be noted that with respect to the procedure for removing the prepattern <b>103</b>, the procedure described in connection with the procedure for removing a part of the plurality of phases of the phase separation structure may be employed. Also, this step may be carried out concomitantly with the removing step, or may be carried out before or after the removing step.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="2">Substrate Pattern-Forming Step</heading>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The pattern-forming method preferably further includes the substrate pattern-forming step after the removing step. In this step, using a pattern constituted with a residual part of the plurality of phases <b>105</b><i>b </i>of the directed self-assembling film as a mask, the silicon atom-containing film and the substrate are etched to permit patterning. After completion of the patterning onto the substrate, the phases used as a mask are removed from the substrate by a dissolving treatment or the like, whereby a patterned substrate (pattern) can be finally obtained. Examples of the resultant pattern include line-and-space patterns, hole patterns, and the like. As the procedure for the etching, a procedure similar to that in the removing step may be employed, and the etching gas and the etching liquid may be appropriately selected in accordance with the materials of the silicon atom-containing film and the substrate. For example, in a case where the substrate is a silicon material, a gas mixture of chlorofluorocarbon-containing gas and SF<sub>4</sub>, or the like may be used. Alternatively, in a case where the substrate is a metal film, a gas mixture of BCl<sub>3 </sub>and Cl<sub>2</sub>, or the like may be used. The pattern obtained according to the pattern-forming method is suitably used for semiconductor elements and the like, and further the semiconductor elements are widely used for LED, solar cells, and the like.</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="2">Directed Self-Assembling Composition (I)</heading>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The directed self-assembling composition (I) contains the block copolymer (A) and the polymer (B). The directed self-assembling composition (I) preferably contains (C) a solvent, and may contain other component, within a range not leading to impairment of the effects of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Hereinafter, each component will be explained.</p>
      <heading id="h-00015-en" level="2">(A) Block Copolymer</heading>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The block copolymer (A) has a structure in which a plurality of blocks are linked. Each of the blocks is constituted with a chain structure of structural units derived from a single type of monomer. According to the block copolymer (A) having such a plurality of blocks, the same type of blocks are aggregated by means of heating or the like, and phases each constituted with the same type of blocks are formed. In this process, it is presumed that since it is unlikely for phases each formed from a different type of blocks to mix with each other, a phase separation structure having an ordered pattern can be formed in which different types of phases are periodically and alternately repeated.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The block copolymer (A) is exemplified by a diblock copolymer, a triblock copolymer, a tetrablock copolymer, and the like. Of these, a diblock copolymer and a triblock copolymer are preferred, and a diblock copolymer is more preferred in light of the possibility of further facilitated formation of a pattern having desired fine microdomains.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The block is exemplified by a polystyrene block, a poly(meth)acrylic acid ester block, a polyvinyl acetal block, a polyurethane block, a polyurea block, a polyimide block, a polyamide block, an epoxy block, a novolak-type phenol block, a polyester block, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The block copolymer (A) is preferably constituted with a polystyrene block and a poly(meth)acrylic acid ester block in light of the possibility of facilitated formation of the phase separation structure and an ease of the removal of the phases.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In a case where the block copolymer (A) is a diblock copolymer, the molar ratio ((I)/(II)) of two structural units (I) and (II) constituting the diblock copolymer may be appropriately selected in accordance with a line/space width ratio of a desired line-spaces pattern, dimensions of a contact hole, and the like. However, in light of the possibility of formation of a finer and more favorable pattern, the molar ratio ((I)/(II)) of two structural units (I) and (II) is preferably no less than 35/65 and no greater than 65/35, and more preferably no less than 40/60 and no greater than 60/40 in the case of the formation of a line-and-space pattern. Alternatively, in the case of the formation of a contact hole pattern, the molar ratio ((I)/(II)) of two structural units (I) and (II) is preferably no less than 65/35 and no greater than 85/15, and more preferably no less than 65/35 and no greater than 75/25.</p>
      <heading id="h-00016-en" level="2">Synthesis of Block Copolymer (A)</heading>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The block copolymer (A) can be synthesized by forming each block in a desired order through living anionic polymerization, living radical polymerization, or the like. For example, the block copolymer (A) can be synthesized by linking a polystyrene block, a poly(meth)acrylic acid ester block, other block that is distinct from these blocks, and the like through polymerization in a desired order, followed by the addition of methanol or the like to stop the polymerization.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">For example, in a case where the block copolymer (A) which is a diblock copolymer constituted with the polystyrene block and the poly(meth)acrylic acid ester block is synthesized, styrene is first polymerized in an appropriate solvent using an anionic polymerization initiator to form the polystyrene block.

      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0168">Into a nitrogen-substituted reaction vessel having an inner volume of 0.5 L were charged 200 g of tetrahydrofuran. After 0.047 g of s-butyllithium as an initiator and 10 g of the compound (M-1) (styrene) were added, the polymerization was allowed to proceed at â70Â° C. to form a polystyrene block. After the completion of the polymerization was confirmed, 0.40 g of diphenylethylene and 0.063 g of lithium chloride were added. Further, 12 g of the compound (M-2) (tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate) was added to the reaction vessel, and the polymerization was allowed to proceed to form a poly(tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate) block. After the completion of the polymerization was confirmed, a certain amount of methanol was added to stop the polymerization, whereby a block copolymer (A-1) was synthesized. The progress of the polymerization was chased through determination of the residual solid content by the measurement after heating the polymerization reaction solution sampled into an aluminum plate on a hot plate at 150Â° C. The block copolymer (A-1) had an Mw of 36,800, and an Mw/Mn of 1.10. In addition, the result of the <sup>13</sup>C-NMR analysis indicated that the proportions of the structural unit derived from (M-1) and the structural unit derived from (M-2) were 50 mol % and 50 mol %, respectively.

A 1,000 mL three-neck flask into which 100 g of 2-butanone was charged was purged with nitrogen for 30 min. After the nitrogen-purging, the reaction vessel was heated to 80Â° C. with stirring, and then the monomer solution prepared above was added dropwise over 3 hrs using a dropping funnel. The time of the start of the dropwise addition was considered to be the time of start of the polymerization, and the polymerization reaction was allowed to proceed for 6 hrs. After completing the polymerization, the polymerization reaction solution was cooled to 30Â° C. or below by water-cooling. After cooling, the polymerization reaction solution was charged into 2,000 g of methanol, and a deposited white powder was filtered off. An operation of dispersing the filtered white powder in 400 g of methanol to form a slurry, washing, and filtering the white powder off was conducted twice. Thereafter, the white powder was dried in vacuo at 50Â° C. for 17 hrs to obtain a polymer (B-1) as a white powder. The polymer (B-1) had an Mw of 20,070, and an Mw/Mn of 1.28.

      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0177">On a 12-inch silicon wafer was spin-coated a composition for forming an organic underlayer film containing a crosslinking agent using a spin coater (âCLEAN TRACK ACT12â available from Tokyo Electron Limited), followed by baking at 205Â° C. for 60 sec to provide an organic underlayer film having a film thickness of 77 nm. Next, after an ArF resist composition containing a polymer that includes an acid-labile group, a radiation-sensitive acid generating agent and an organic solvent was spin-coated on the organic underlayer film, prebaking (PB) was carried out at 120Â° C. for 60 sec to provide a resist film having a film thickness of 60 nm. Then, the resist film was exposed through a mask pattern using ArF Immersion Scanner (âNSR-S610Câ available from NIKON Corporation), under an optical condition involving NA of 1.30, Dipole-x, and Ï of 0.977/0.78. Thereafter, PEB was carried out at 115Â° C. for 60 sec, and then a development with a 2.38% by mass aqueous tetramethylammonium hydroxide solution was carried out at 23Â° C. for 30 sec, followed by washing with water and drying to give a line-and-space prepattern (line of 72 nm/pitch of 170 nm). Then, the prepattern was irradiated with an ultraviolet ray of 254 nm under the condition of 150 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, followed by baking at 170Â° C. for 5 min to obtain a substrate having the underlayer film and the prepattern formed thereon.</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0178">Each directed self-assembling composition prepared in Examples 1 to 6 and Comparative Example 1 was applied to the substrate obtained above such that the formed coating film had a thickness of 30 nm. Thereafter, the directed self-assembling composition was heated at 250Â° C. for 5 min such that phase separation took place, whereby a microdomain structure was formed. Then, after irradiation with a radioactive ray of 172 nm at an intensity of 300 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, immersion in a mixed liquid of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK)/2-propanol (IPA)=2/8 (mass ratio) for 5 min allowed the phases constituted with the poly(tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate) block to be removed through dissolution, whereby a line-and-space pattern was formed.</p>

      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0181">As is seen from the results shown in Tables 2 and 3, the pattern-forming method according to Examples enables a line-and-space pattern and a contact hole pattern each having a sufficiently fine microdomain structure to be obtained conveniently. In contrast, in the pattern-forming method according to Comparative Examples, phase separation hardly occurs in the pattern formation, and therefore a microdomain structure is unlikely to be formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0182">The pattern-forming method and the directed self-assembling composition according to the embodiments of the present invention enable a sufficiently fine pattern to be conveniently formed. Therefore, these can be suitably used for lithography processes in manufacture of various types of electronic devices such as semiconductor devices and liquid crystal devices for which further miniaturization is demanded.</p>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0183">Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.</p>
