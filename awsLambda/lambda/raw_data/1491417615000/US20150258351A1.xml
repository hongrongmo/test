      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Focused ultrasound surgery has tremendous potential compared to other energy based treatment modalities. Ultrasound energy can be placed deep into tissue at precise depths with highly controlled spatial distributions. However, one difficulty has been treating a region or interest having a large volume. Attempts to address such problems have produced systems that are limited in flexibility and coverage to the scanned volume, not only of the treatment region but regions for imaging and monitoring. New systems and methods are needed for ultrasound treatment, which provide increased accuracy and flexibility of treatment and monitoring with ultrasound energy.</p>
