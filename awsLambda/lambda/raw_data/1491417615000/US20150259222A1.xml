      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The present invention is in the technical field of electrolysis. More particularly, the present invention is in the technical field of utilizing electrolytic generation of oxygen and/or hydrogen in order to increase the oxygen and/or hydrogen content in the groundwater to aid in the remediation of contamination. This invention relates to the improvement of an electrolysis remediation device and method.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">There is often a need to reduce the levels of the many different contaminants that may be found in groundwater and to do this in a nonintrusive way in-situ. In the recent past, there have been many methods and techniques used, but perhaps the most widely available and applicable technologies aim to increase the oxygen content of the soil or groundwater in order to gain both active and passive breakdown of the contaminant load. A variety of soil and groundwater contaminants are more readily broken down in an oxygen rich environment. Increasing the oxygen content of the soil and groundwater has been used to address a broad range of volatile and semivolatile contaminants including many of the contaminants associated with fuels, BTEX compounds and chlorinated solvents. Hydrogen is widely recognized as a required key electron donor for the biologically mediated remediation of chlorinated compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The most common method of increasing the oxygen content of groundwater is by sparging the medium with air or oxygen. This is typically done by enlisting motors and pumps to push air or oxygen into the saturated zone, where the air then traverses both horizontally and vertically through the many crevices and capillaries in order to both volatize groundwater contaminants and to promote biodegradation in saturated and unsaturated soil zones by the increase of subsurface oxygen content. Excess volatilized vapors may then migrate into the vadose zone where they can be extracted via vacuum and removed. Airsparging with the primary goal of highlighting the bioremediation process, both below and above the water table, obtained with the increase in oxygen concentration versus the volatilization process of contaminants is typically referred to as biosparging, although the two terms are often used interchangeably. Sites with homogeneous, relatively permeable soil conditions are more favorable for air sparging techniques due to greater likelihood of contact between the sparged air and contaminated media and the greater effective migration of the volatized contaminants. Other site conditions that are favorable to air sparging techniques are those sites with large thicknesses of saturation and depth to groundwater.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Air sparging systems must be properly designed with air flow rates and pressures that correspond to each site in order to provide adequate coverage of the area of contamination while at the same time minimizing uncontrolled release of unmanageable amounts of volatized compounds into the atmosphere. Horizontal Well Soil Vapor Extraction systems are typically used in conjunction with air sparging to help safeguard against volatile contaminant release, and air sparging helps increase the effectiveness of standalone soil vapor extraction techniques since the volatilization can overcome the simple diffusion limited extraction of VOCs from groundwater and it can also be effective in treating contamination found in the capillary fringe and below the water table.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">A majority of the conventional air sparging systems utilize the injection of atmospheric oxygen, which generally contains just a little over 20.5% oxygen. These systems, although proven effective at increasing the oxygen content of the saturated and unsaturated soil structure are limited by this oxygen percentage of ambient air and will often have a difficult time raising the oxygen to a supersaturated level. It has been shown that if you increase the oxygen content of the soil column then there will be a subsequent acceleration of volatilization and bioremediation of contaminants, so it should be understood that a device is needed that can achieve higher levels of oxygen saturation in both all zones found in the soil columns.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">It is therefore an objective of the present invention to provide an improved device and method for the oxygenation and/or hydrogenation of the different soil zones.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The present invention is an apparatus and method for the electrolysis of water.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The invention may be conceptualized as a device that will provide for the electrolysis of water in contaminated environments with the goal of achieving a high oxygen and/or hydrogen loading of the saturated and unsaturated soil zones. The production of oxygen and hydrogen by the hydrolysis of water is well known, and the breakdown of water molecules occurs when a current is applied across a cathode and an anode in an aqueous media. This current may be provided by any DC current source and the resultant reaction has hydrogen gas produced at the cathode and oxygen gas produced at the anode. The stoichiometric representations of the reaction are easily found in current literature.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">When these gases form in a soil matrix the gases will rise vertically and expand horizontally out through the microfractures found in the soil and will establish an area of influence at which the oxygen and/or hydrogen content will be effectively raised. This area of influence will be greatly dependent on many outside factors such as temperature, soil composition, and water contaminants present, and also on controllable factors such as current applied, the size of the hydrolysis device and the effectiveness of the anode and cathode. Many different anode and cathode compositions and combinations are currently available and have been explored in previous art. Cathodes of a metal or metallic oxide group such as platinum, titanium, iridium, palladium, manganese, tantalum, molybdenum, cobalt, tungsten, lead, osmium, nickel, iron, rhodium and rhenium are some mentioned in literature as being effective in hydrolysis systems. Anodes are also formed with some of the same metals and metallic oxides listed and both electrodes can be made from alloys of the above metals along with co-deposited oxides on different substrates. Some of the more effective models have shown that an anode composed of platinum with iridium oxide and a stainless steel mesh cathode separated by a critical distance to be the most effective.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The current invention will provide a device whose primary objective is to provide an electrolytic device that shall serve as an effective oxygen generator in an aqueous media. Molecular oxygen radicals will be produced and will react with other oxygen radicals to form molecular oxygen. The electrodes may be of any number of combinations of the above listed metal or metal oxide combinations and shall be separated by a critical distance. These anodes and cathodes may be contained in protected shell that will still allow for the exposure of the electrodes to the aqueous media. Controls and sensors shall be a part of the device in order to regulate the timing and necessary current and in order to detect different chemical parameters or effectiveness of the device. The size and voltage requirements will be determined by the site specific needs for the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In one embodiment of the current invention, the anode and cathode arrangement will be placed in a tubular housing that shall serve as a protective case. This housing shall have exposure windows that will allow for the electrodes to come into contact with the aqueous media. This housing may be placed into the saturated zone of soil in many different ways, however the device will allow for the placement of the device using all of the common drilling means available today including but not limited to DPT (Direct Push Technology), soil boring, and conventional soil drilling. The device may be placed directly into a soil boring hole and just left in place within the saturated zone when the drilling shafts are removed. In another embodiment, the invention may be placed into an existing well by simply lowering the device down in the well and into the groundwater. In another embodiment, the current invention may be made a part of the portion of a Groundwater Monitoring Well's wall and be installed at the same time as the well itself. In another embodiment, the cathode and anode separated by a critical distance may be formed into sheets that can either be rigid or flexible for the purpose of layering under an area that would need benefit from an increased oxygen level. In this embodiment, the sheet could also be arranged in a vertical position to act as kind of a downgradient oxygen curtain. In all of these embodiments the goal is create an oxygenation and/or hydrogenation system with lower power demands and higher effectiveness of typical sparging systems.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The invention may also be conceptualized as a method for the oxygenation or hydrogenation of a contaminated soil matrix. The method produces oxygen and/or hydrogen for the purpose of raising the oxygen and/or hydrogen level in compromised/contaminated soil zones with the hope of aiding volatilization and bioremediation of the hazardous compounds. The method comprises the steps of (1) providing an energy source to two electrodes situated in an aqueous media or saturated soil zone; (2) in response to this energy input, elemental hydrogen and oxygen form at the anodes and cathodes; (3) allowing for the release of oxygen and/or hydrogen into the contaminated media aiding in the remediation of groundwater and connected soil zones. The invention may also be conceptualized as a preventive method for the contamination different areas in that it may be installed without and/or prior to contamination being present.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">It is also within the scope of this invention to cover various models and energy demands depending both on the need for oxygen and/or hydrogen generation or in place power constraints. The current invention may be powered by a variety of sources including but not limited to generators, electric power grids, batteries and solar power.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In one embodiment, the device could just simply be used as a preventative measure to potential contamination or potential migration of contamination. In another embodiment the device could be utilized to limit the actual migration of contaminants both vertically and horizontally. In another embodiment the device could not only be used to control migration but would actively lead to the volatilization and/or breakdown of contaminants present.</p>
