      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Steam reforming is the most widely used method for generating synthesis gas from light hydrocarbons. In steam reforming, a hydrocarbon feed such as natural gas, liquid gas or naphtha is endothermically reacted with steam in a catalytic tubular reactor, hereinafter called âsteam reforming reactorâ, to form synthesis gas. Process heat and flue gas heat are utilized for steam generation. Details of such a system may be found, for example, in Chapter 2 of the article âGas Productionâ in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry (doi:10.1002/14356007.a12<sub>â</sub>169.pub2, electronic edition 2007).</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">First, superheated process steam is added to the purified, in particular, desulphurized, hydrocarbon feed in accordance with the steam/carbon ratio required for the reforming reactions. Then the hydrocarbon/steam mixture obtained is heated and distributed over the catalyst-filled and externally-fired tubes of the steam reforming reactor. When the mixture flows through the tubes, it reacts in accordance with the following reactions:</p>

      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0004">In order to minimize the methane content in the synthesis gas, maximize the hydrogen yield and avoid the formation of elemental carbon and deposition thereof on the catalyst, the steam reforming reactor is operated at a higher steam/carbon ratio than is theoretically required.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0005">For purposes of the following description, the materials and mixtures described, for example a hydrocarbon feed or a synthesis gas, are referred to a âstreamsâ or âfractionsâ. A stream normally describes a fluid flowing through a conduit, whereas a fraction designates a portion of a starting mixture separated from the starting mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0006">A stream or a fraction can be described as ârichâ or âleanâ in one or more components, e.g. hydrogen, wherein ârichâ is generally a portion more than 75% and âleanâ a portion less than 25% in each case based on a weight or volume basis.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0007">The steam reforming process is generally followed by a plurality of workup steps which serve for obtaining pure end products from the synthesis gas. The synthesis gas is first cooled followed by a step of removing carbon dioxide in a carbon dioxide separation unit, wherein some of the carbon dioxide is scrubbed out, for example with methanol and/or diethanolamine. Carbon dioxide can also be removed, for example, by subsequent temperature-swing adsorption. A cryogenic separation of the synthesis gas is performed to provide a hydrogen-rich fraction and a carbon monoxide-rich fraction, with the latter being compressed and delivered to the battery limit.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0008">The hydrogen-rich fraction resulting from the cryogenic separation, still contains impurities such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and light hydrocarbons, such as methane, ethane, propane, ethylene and propylene. These impurities are separated in a pressure-swing adsorption plant, obtaining residual gas or tail gas, and the hydrogen product, preferably pure hydrogen from the hydrogen-rich fraction.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0009">Since the heat balance for the main reactions (1)-(3) cited above is endothermic, the heat required must be supplied by external firing. Fuel gas for this firing can be supplied from the residual gas of the pressure-swing adsorption plant, and from also heating gas from beyond the battery limit.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0010">The effect of various parameters on the composition of the synthesis gas are summarized in WO 2005/040704 A2 and known methods are disclosed in WO 03/086965 A1, EP 1 544 166 A2 and EP 0 790 212 A1.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0011">Depending on the desired hydrogen/carbon monoxide quantitative product ratio in the synthesis gas, a carbon dioxide fraction from the carbon dioxide separation unit can be recycled via a recycle compressor and added to the hydrogen feed. In a plant having a natural gas feed, with complete recycling of the carbon dioxide fraction that is separated, and depending on further boundary conditions, a hydrogen/carbon monoxide quantitative product ratio of approximately 2.5 can be obtained. If less hydrogen is required, carbon dioxide can be imported from beyond the battery limit, in order to decrease the hydrogen/carbon monoxide quantitative product ratio.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0012">If a higher hydrogen/carbon monoxide quantitative product ratio is desired, the recycling of the carbon dioxide fraction can be reduced to zero. This results in the hydrogen/carbon monoxide quantitative product ratio increasing to approximately 4.1. If more hydrogen is to be produced, the plant can be operated using different parameters (e.g. higher steam fraction) but this has a direct effect on plant size and therefore capital costs. As an alternative, a side stream shift or a separate shift line can be installed, but this also leads to an increase in the capital costs.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0013">There remains a need in the art for improvements to the production of hydrogen-rich synthesis gas using a stream reforming reactor without an appreciable increase in capital costs.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0017">The invention provides a method for operating a steam reforming plant wherein a hydrocarbon-rich feed is reacted with steam to form a synthesis gas using at least one steam reforming reactor. The synthesis gas is processed in at least one processing unit to produce a hydrogen-rich fraction by separating carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide from the synthesis gas. The hydrogen-rich fraction is further processed in at least one pressure-swing adsorption plant to produce a residual gas. As noted above, in a first mode of operation, at least some of the carbon dioxide separated from the synthesis gas can be recycled using a recycle compressor to compress the carbon dioxide and return it to the hydrocarbon-rich feed. The carbon dioxide separated from the synthesis gas can be withdrawn from a carbon dioxide separator, e.g. a carbon dioxide scrubber according to known methods, such as that described in WO 2005/040704 A2.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0018">According to the invention, a second mode of operation is carried out, wherein the recycle compressor is not used for compression of carbon dioxide that is separated from the synthesis gas. Rather, the recycle compressor is used to add at least part of the residual gas separated in the pressure-swing adsorption plant to the hydrogen-rich fraction upstream of the pressure-swing adsorption plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0019">According to the invention, in the first mode of operation, the recycle compressor is used in the standard manner to add carbon dioxide separated from the synthesis gas to the hydrocarbon-rich feed in order to achieve a low hydrogen/carbon monoxide quantitative product ratio. When a high hydrogen/carbon monoxide quantitative product ratio is sought, then the second mode of operation according to the invention is performed. In this second mode, the recycling of the carbon dioxide fraction is reduced to zero and the recycle compressor is instead used to recycle a part of the residual gas from the pressure-swing adsorption plant into the hydrogen-rich fraction upstream of the pressure-swing adsorption plant. This second mode of operation increases the hydrogen yield. The pressure-swing adsorption plant typically achieves a hydrogen yield of approximately 90%. The remaining 10% of hydrogen is released in the residual gas. By Therefore, by recycling at least a part of the residual gas and feeding it in upstream of the pressure-swing adsorption plant, approximately 90% of the hydrogen present in the residual gas passes into the hydrogen product, and so increases the hydrogen yield correspondingly.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0020">The method according to the invention enables the hydrogen/carbon monoxide quantitative product ratio of the synthesis gas produced in the steam reforming plant to be increased by simple and inexpensive measures. It is possible to dispense with the commonly employed shift, i.e. an additional plant that carries out a carbon monoxide or water gas shift reaction, of at least a part of the carbon monoxide present in the synthesis gas. Further, a conventionally required strong increase in the steam proportion in the steam reforming reactor, which requires additional energy, is not necessary. Therefore, the maximum hydrogen yield of a plant using the method of the invention can be increased without significant increase in capital costs.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0021">By virtue of the invention, it is possible to significantly increase the hydrogen/carbon monoxide quantitative product ratio without having to increase the size of the plant. When natural gas is used as hydrocarbon-rich feed, the ratio can be increased to approximately 4.8. This corresponds to a yield increase of approximately 5-10%, which means that either a larger amount of a hydrogen product can be withdrawn from the plant or the plant load can be correspondingly reduced. In other words, when using the invention, a constant amount of the hydrogen-rich fraction fed into the pressure-swing adsorption plant (a constant amount of the carbon monoxide product is produced), the amount of the hydrogen product produced is increased over what can be produced by conventional methods. If this increase is not desired, for example because of the increase of the hydrogen/carbon monoxide quantitative product ratio, then the corresponding reduction of the carbon monoxide product obtained by the method of the invention allows for a reduction of throughput and therefore lower costs.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0022">Depending on the desired hydrogen/carbon monoxide quantitative product ratio, the invention allows the plant to be run in either the first or second mode of operation. The invention also provides a method that is therefore easily adaptable to meet desired product requirements.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0023">Operation in the second mode according to the invention, i.e. feeding the separated residual gas into the hydrogen-rich fraction upstream of the pressure-swing adsorption plant, is selected when the desired hydrogen/carbon monoxide quantitative product ratio is at least 4.0. Values this high or higher, can only be achieved in conventional plants by enlarging the plant at considerable additional expenditure.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0024">The hydrogen-rich fraction fed into the pressure-swing adsorption plant typically has a hydrogen content of at least 85 mol %, and in many cases at least 95 mol %. The tail gas or residual gas from the pressure-swing adsorption plant typically has at least 2 to 50 mol % carbon monoxide, 0 to 5 mol % carbon dioxide, 30 to 90 mol % hydrogen and 0 to 20 mol % light hydrocarbons. These values depend greatly on the respective configuration of a carbon monoxide separation unit used.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0025">When natural gas is used as the hydrocarbon-rich feed, the hydrogen/carbon monoxide quantitative product ratio obtained is particularly high. This is because natural gas is principally made up of methane that has a favourable hydrogen/carbon ratio of 4 to 1, thereby producing a particularly high yield of hydrogen. Other feeds having varying contents of light, gaseous hydrocarbons can also be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0026">The steam reforming plant according to the invention is equipped for carrying the method of the invention. The plant includes at least one steam reforming reactor for reacting a hydrocarbon-rich feed with steam to form a synthesis gas, at least one processing unit for obtaining a hydrogen-rich fraction from the synthesis gas by separating carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, and at least one pressure-swing adsorption plant for separating a residual gas from the hydrogen-rich fraction. The plant also includes at least one recycle compressor that allows the plant to operate in either the first or second mode as described. In the first mode of operation, the recycle compressor is connected to the processing unit and also to the intake side of the steam reformer so that carbon dioxide separated from the synthesis gas can be added at least in part to the hydrocarbon-rich feed. In the second mode of operation, the recycle compressor is connected to the processing unit and the pressure-swing adsorption plant so that residual gas separated in the pressure-swing adsorption plant can be added at least in part to the hydrogen-rich fraction upstream of the pressure-swing adsorption plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0027">The steam reforming plant of the invention advantageously includes at least one control unit for switching the steam reforming plant between the first mode of operation and the second mode of operation. This control unit can be fully automatic based on a user presetting making the plant particularly simple to operate.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0028">The processing unit of the plant according to the invention preferably includes at least one carbon dioxide separation unit, at least one temperature-swing adsorption plant and at least one cryogenic separation unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0029">The invention will be further described with reference to the drawing figures wherein like components are give like reference characters.</p>

The carbon dioxide is compressed in the recycle compressor <b>10</b> and then added via conduit o at least in part to the hydrocarbon-rich feed in the conduit b.
