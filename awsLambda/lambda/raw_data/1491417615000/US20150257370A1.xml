      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to pet accessories. Specifically, the present invention relates to a pouch adapted to couple with a pet's leash for storing items while exercising or walking a pet. The pouch is configured to stay secure at the top of a leash near a handle, and is interchangeable with most leashes.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">There are many types of apparatuses, devices and products available that enable pet owners to walk or exercise their pets without the pet running away uncontrolled, commonly known as leashes. There are also many types of storage devices available for people to place personal items such as mobile phones or music players while walking or exercising their pets, such as for example packs secured with a zipper or hook-and-loop system and worn around the hips or waist with strap. However, there is no existing apparatus designed to securely hold personal items on a leash and away from one's person, so that users can walk or run with their pets while still being able to conduct a hands-free phone conversation or listen to music. Similarly, there is no existing apparatus designed simply to securely store items away from their person and on a leash while walking exercising a pet.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Many people enjoy engaging in athletic activities with their pets, such as running. While running, pockets or purses are often cumbersome items to use to store items such phones, music players, identification documents, or other personal items. There is therefore a need in the art for an apparatus and device that enables such items to be stored on a pet's leash while a pet is being walked or while the owner of the pet is running with the pet attached to the leash.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Some pet leashes include a pocket, usually made from mesh or other stretchable material, configured as part of a handle so that it is part of the leash itself. Such configurations have durability problems as they are at risk of easy tearing or losing shape due to the proximity to the handle. When the pocket tears or breaks in some way, or loses its intended function, a new leash must be purchased.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">It is one objective of the present invention to provide for convenient storage of items on a pet's leash. It is another objective of the present invention to provide a storage pouch for use with a pet's leash. It is another objective of the present invention to provide for hands-free use of equipment, and for securely storing items such as identification documents, while exercising a pet, such as walking, running or playing. It is still another objective of the present invention to provide a secure place to store personal items while exercising a pet so that handbags, packs, purses and clothing do not need to be used. It is still another objective of the present invention to provide an interchangeable apparatus for use on many different types of pet leashes or animal equipment, having a channel through which a leash or other component of animal equipment feeds through to couple thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present invention is an interchangeable storage pouch for use when exercising a pet. The storage pouch includes one or more pockets and a channel through which a leash or other component of equipment for use on animals is capable of being fed through to removeably and interchangeably couple the storage pouch thereto. In one embodiment, the storage pouch comprises a pair of pockets formed within each of a front side and a back side of the storage pouch. Each pocket includes a flap and a fastening means for closing the pocket and securely holding one or more items within the pocket while a pet is being exercised. The channel is positioned between the pair of pockets for accepting a leash of a pet so that the leash feeds into and passes through the channel and the storage pouch, and a fastening device for coupling the storage pouch to a handle of the leash.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In another embodiment, the present invention is a storage pouch for use when exercising a pet that comprises a pocket positioned on an outer surface of a front side of a storage pouch. The pocket has two compartments formed therein, and a flap configured with fastening means for closing the pocket and securely holding one or more items within each of the two compartments while a pet is being exercised. The channel is positioned on an outer surface of a back side, for accepting a leash of a pet so that the leash feeds into and passes through the channel, to enable the storage pouch to be affixed to the leash while the pet is being exercised. The storage pouch also includes a fastening device for coupling the storage pouch to a handle of the leash.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In the following description of the present invention reference is made to the exemplary embodiments illustrating the principles of the present invention and how it is practiced. Other embodiments will be utilized to practice the present invention and structural and functional changes will be made thereto without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The present invention is a storage pouch for use when exercising a pet that is removable from, and interchangeable with, pet leashes and other animal exercising or riding equipment. The inventive storage pouch includes one or more pockets and a channel configured thereon, providing an opening through which the leash or other component of equipment for use on animals is capable of being fed into and passing through to couple the storage pouch so that items may be securely held away from one's person while exercising a pet. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is an overall depiction of a storage pouch <b>10</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. In <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, a user <b>12</b> is shown exercising a pet <b>14</b> using a leash <b>16</b>. The leash <b>16</b> includes a handle <b>18</b> and a connection portion <b>20</b> for coupling the leash <b>16</b> to a collar or other such apparatus on the pet <b>14</b>. The storage pouch <b>10</b> is configured to carry within it one or more items such as a mobile telephone or other such device, and <figref>FIG. 1</figref> additionally depicts the user <b>12</b> with a corded headset coupled to an item within the storage pouch <b>10</b> while the user <b>12</b> listens to audio via headset ear bud device.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The storage pouch <b>10</b>, and the components thereof, may be made of any suitable material, such as mesh, leather, or natural or synthetic cloths and fabric. The channel <b>22</b> provides an opening that serves as a means of attachment to the leash <b>16</b>. The storage pouch <b>10</b> may be comprised of one or more pockets. In the embodiment as in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the leash <b>16</b> slides through the channel <b>22</b> between front and back pockets of a double-sided storage pouch <b>10</b>. Other configurations in additional embodiments are described further herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Natural or synthetic cloths and fabric used to make the storage pouch <b>10</b> and the components included therein, may include materials such as cotton, wool, linen, silk, and woven cloths and fabrics from either animal or vegetable fibers, such as for example, but not limited to, burlap. Other suitable materials may also include neoprene, or any similar polychloroprene composition or synthetic rubber that are produced by polymerization of chloroprene; Kevlar®, or similar para-aramid synthetic fiber; polyester; nylon; canvas; and blended fabrics such as polyester blends and nylon blends. Accordingly it is to be understood that many different types of materials and fabrics may be used and are within the scope of the present invention, and therefore the present invention, regardless of the embodiment in this description, is not to be limited to any one type of material or fabric, nor any one type of material or fabric described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">It is to be understood, as noted above, that many different design configurations and embodiments of the storage pouch are possible, as further described herein. <figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> depict one such design configuration, in which the storage pouch <b>10</b> has a double-sided arrangement with a single pocket on each side of the storage pouch <b>10</b>. The leash <b>16</b> feeds through a center channel <b>22</b> via at least one opening between front and back pockets of the storage pouch <b>10</b> and secures to the pet's existing leash <b>16</b> at or near the handle <b>18</b> with a fastening mechanism <b>24</b> such as a hook-and-loop system (such as for example Velcro™), snaps, buttons, carabineers, or any other device or means for securing the storage pouch <b>10</b> to the leash <b>16</b>. The leash <b>16</b> therefore is capable of passing through the channel <b>22</b> via the at least one opening so that one end of the leash <b>16</b> is held by the user <b>12</b> with the handle <b>18</b>, and the other end of the leash <b>16</b> couples to the collar of the pet <b>14</b> using the connection portion <b>20</b>. The storage pouch <b>10</b> is therefore positioned at some point along the leash <b>16</b> when in use, such as near the handle <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Each pocket of the storage pouch <b>10</b> may be secured using a tab or flap <b>26</b> sewn into and near the top of pouch that forms a closeable opening. The opening may be closed using a hook-and-loop fastening system (such as for example Velcro™), one or more snaps, buttons, carabineers, or any other fastener to hold contents within each pocket of the storage pouch <b>10</b> securely. A ring may also be affixed to the flap <b>26</b> or to the outside of the pocket of the storage pouch <b>10</b> for coupling items such as keys or a set of keys. The ring may also be used to affix a bell or other noise-making device to provide notice to others nearby that a person is exercising a pet.</p>

      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">It is to be understood that other embodiments will be utilized and structural and functional changes will be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The foregoing descriptions of embodiments of the present invention have been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Accordingly, many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings. For example, as noted above, multiple design configurations are contemplated, so that many different types of leashes (including but not limited to canvas, leather, rope, and retractable leases) can be accommodated. Further, channels for these leashes may further include an expansion portion which is open or closed by a zipper, snap(s), or other similar device or system, or may simply expand upon exertion of force, to accommodate different types of leashes with the same storage pouch. Channels in the present invention may therefore expand, and may additionally be comprised of material(s) enabling expansion, so that leashes and equipment of different sizes and shapes may be used with the same storage pouch. Additionally, pocket <b>28</b> in the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 1-6</figref>, and the first and second compartments <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> of <figref>FIGS. 7-10</figref>, as well as the pocket(s) and compartments of <figref>FIGS. 11-12</figref>, may also be configured with such an expansion portion that can be open or closed as suggested above. Pockets <b>28</b>, and first and second compartment <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, may further have any shape or size and come in different sizes and shapes depending on the storage of items therein. Pockets <b>28</b> and first and second compartments <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> may include internal pockets therein. These internal pockets may be specifically-shaped to hold specific devices, such as for example mobile phones or portable music players from particular manufacturers. The pockets <b>28</b> and first and second compartments <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> may themselves be specifically-shaped for devices or items from specific manufacturers. Similarly, the channel <b>22</b> and <b>118</b> may also have different shapes and sizes, and may be specifically-shaped for specific types or manufacturers of leashes <b>16</b>. It is therefore intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Additionally, it is to be understood exercising a pet includes any physical activity with a pet, either indoors or outdoors. Such activity may include walking, running, or playing with a pet, and any other physical activity during which items may be securely stored within the present invention on a pet's leash instead of storage upon one's person.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Regardless of the embodiment in this description, it is to be further understood that the storage pouch of the present invention is configured to couple to the leash or riding equipment at or near a handle thereof (in the case of a leash) or near an easily reachable place relative to the rider (in the case of riding equipment). Such a configuration helps to couple the storage pouch to the leash or riding equipment so that the storage pouch remains positioned in substantially the same plane as the leash (or other equipment) relative to the pet or animal.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Also as noted above, the channel of the present invention provides an opening that allows the leash or other equipment to fully pass through the storage pouch, regardless of the embodiment or configuration. This enables interchangeability, so that the storage pouch can be removed from the leash or other equipment. Such a design allows the storage pouch to be used on other leashes or equipment, and also prevents damage to the leash or other equipment itself. It further enables a user to transfer the storage pouch, with or without its contents, to other places, such as for example to one's handbag or motor vehicle. Where the contents remain within the storage pouch, it enables a user to go from riding a horse to driving home without having to remove, and fumble with, items stored therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The words used in this specification to describe the invention and its various embodiments are to be understood not only in the sense of their commonly defined meanings, but to include by special definition in this specification structure, material or acts beyond the scope of the commonly defined meanings. Thus if an element can be understood in the context of this specification as including more than one meaning, then its use in a claim must be understood as being generic to all possible meanings supported by the specification and by the word itself.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The definitions of the words or elements of the following claims are, therefore, defined in this specification to include not only the combination of elements which are literally set forth, but all equivalent structure, material or acts for performing substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain substantially the same result. In this sense it is therefore contemplated that an equivalent substitution of two or more elements may be made for any one of the elements in the claims below or that a single element may be substituted for two or more elements in a claim. Although elements may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, it is to be expressly understood that one or more elements from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination and that the claimed combination may be directed to a sub-combination or variation of a sub-combination.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Insubstantial changes from the claimed subject matter as viewed by a person with ordinary skill in the art, now known or later devised, are expressly contemplated as being equivalently within the scope of the claims. Therefore, obvious substitutions now or later known to one with ordinary skill in the art are defined to be within the scope of the defined elements.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The claims are thus to be understood to include what is specifically illustrated and described above, what is conceptually equivalent, what can be obviously substituted and also what essentially incorporates the essential idea of the invention.</p>
