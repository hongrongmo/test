      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This invention relates to jacketing compositions for cables and wire insulation based upon poly(phenylene ether).</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In the consumer electronics market, cables are widely used for transferring data or charging power to devices. The cables are likely to be bent during the connection between different devices. As a result, it is desirable for the cables to be flexible. Some jacket materials show wrinkles on cable surfaces when cables are bent. Wrinkling is not desirable from an aesthetic standpoint, and more importantly, wrinkling is considered a failure according to the heat shock test (Underwriters Laboratory (UL) 1581). UL 1581 is an internationally recognized standard test for evaluating the fire safety for electric cables. The test is performed on cables that are tightly wrapped around a support and then are heated at 121Â° C. for one hour. Cable wrinkling is considered a cracking failure according to UL 1581 because wrinkles are permanently fixed during the test.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">As a result, there is an ongoing need for cable jacketing compositions that are flexible and do not wrinkle.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">These and other needs are met by the present invention, which is directed to compositions of poly(phenylene ether) (PPE) and thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) for use as cable jacketing materials. In one aspect, the invention is directed to a flexible, wrinkle-resistant cable jacketing composition, comprising: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>(a) 20 to 40 weight percent of a poly(phenylene ether);</li><li>(b) 25 to 50 weight percent of a hydrogenated block copolymer of an alkenyl aromatic compound and a conjugated diene;</li><li>(c) 3 to 15 percent of a polypropylene homopolymer;</li><li>(d) 5 to 15 weight percent of a polybutene; and</li><li>(e) 10 to 47 weight percent of a flame retardant;</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0010">wherein the weight percents are based on the total weight of the composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0011">Surprisingly, the addition of polypropylene (PP) to PPE-TPE jacketing compositions gives rise to decreased wrinkling of jacketed cables as compared to compositions not containing PP. The PP-containing compositions of the invention generally have fewer or almost no wrinkles on the jacketed cable surface upon bending the jacketed cable. Also, increased PP loading in the compositions gives rise to less wrinkling in bent, jacketed cables.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0012">In other aspects, the invention is directed to processes for making such compositions, as well as articles derived therefrom.</p>

In some embodiments, the poly(phenylene ether) is an unfunctionalized poly(phenylene ether). An unfunctionalized poly(phenylene ether) is a poly(phenylene ether) consisting of the polymerization product of one or more phenols. The term âunfunctionalized poly(phenylene ether)â excludes functionalized poly(phenylene ether)s such as acid-functionalized poly(phenylene ether)s and anhydride-functionalized poly(phenylene ether)s.

      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0021">In some embodiments, the poly(phenylene ether) is essentially free of incorporated diphenoquinone residues. âDiphenoquinone residuesâ means the dimerized moiety that may form in the oxidative polymerization reaction giving rise to the poly(phenylene ethers) contemplated for use in the present invention. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,306,874 (Hay), synthesis of poly(phenylene ethers) by oxidative polymerization of monohydric phenols yields not only the desired poly(phenylene ether) but also a diphenoquinone side product. For example, when the monohydric phenol is 2,6-dimethylphenol, 3,3â²,5,5â²-tetramethyldiphenoquinone (TMDQ) is generated. Typically, the diphenoquinone is âre-equilibratedâ into the poly(phenylene ether) (i.e., the diphenoquinone is incorporated into the poly(phenylene ether) structure) by heating the polymerization reaction mixture to yield a poly(phenylene ether) comprising terminal or internal diphenoquinone residues. As used herein, âessentially freeâ means that fewer than 1 weight percent of poly(phenylene ether) molecules comprise the residue of a diphenoquinone as measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) (Mole of TMDQÃMolecular Weight of unit TMDQ)/(Mole of PolymerÃNumber Average Molecular Weight (Mn)). In some embodiments, fewer than 0.5 weight percent of poly(phenylene ether) molecules comprise the residue of a diphenoquinone.</p>

      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0023">However, such re-equilibration reduces the molecular weight of the poly(phenylene ether) (e.g., p and q+r are less than n). Accordingly, when a higher molecular weight and stable molecular weight poly(phenylene ether) is desired, it may be desirable to separate the diphenoquinone from the poly(phenylene ether) rather than re-equilibrating the diphenoquinone into the poly(phenylene ether) chains. Such a separation can be achieved, for example, by precipitation of the poly(phenylene ether) in a solvent or solvent mixture in which the poly(phenylene ether) is insoluble and the diphenoquinone is soluble with very minimum time between end of reaction and precipitation.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0024">For example, when a poly(phenylene ether) is prepared by oxidative polymerization of 2,6-dimethylphenol in toluene to yield a toluene solution comprising poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene ether) and 3,3â²,5,5â²-tetramethyldiphenoquinone, a poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene ether) essentially free of diphenoquinone can be obtained by mixing 1 volume of the toluene solution with about 1 to about 4 volumes of methanol or methanol water mixture. Alternatively, the amount of diphenoquinone side-product generated during oxidative polymerization can be minimized (e.g., by initiating oxidative polymerization in the presence of less than 10 weight percent of the monohydric phenol and adding at least 95 weight percent of the monohydric phenol over the course of at least 50 minutes), and/or the re-equilibration of the diphenoquinone into the poly(phenylene ether) chain can be minimized (e.g., by isolating the poly(phenylene ether) no more than 200 minutes after termination of oxidative polymerization). These approaches are described U.S. Pat. No. 8,025,158, by Delsman and Schoenmakers. Alternatively, diphenoquinone amounts can be achieved by removing the TMDQ formed during polymerization by filtration, specifically after stopping the oxygen feed into the polymerization reactor.</p>

      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0090">In addition to the other components, the cable jacketing composition comprises a plasticizer. As used herein, the term âplasticizerâ refers to a compound that is effective to plasticize the jacketing composition as a whole or at least one component of the jacketing composition. In some embodiments, the plasticizer is effective to plasticize the poly(phenylene ether). The plasticizers are typically low molecular weight, relatively nonvolatile molecules that dissolve in a polymer, separating the chains from each other and hence facilitating reptation and reducing the glass transition temperature of the jacketing composition. In some embodiments, the plasticizer has a glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) of about â110 to â50Â° C., is miscible primarily with poly(phenylene ether)resin, and has a molecular weight less than or equal to 1,000 grams per mole.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0091">Suitable plasticizers include, for example, benzoate esters (including dibenzoate esters), pentaerythritol esters, triaryl phosphates (including halogen substituted triaryl phosphates), phthalate esters, trimellitate esters, pyromellitate esters, and the like, and mixtures thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0092">In some embodiments, the plasticizer is a triaryl phosphate. Suitable triaryl phosphates include those having the structure</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0093">The jacketing composition may, optionally, further comprise one or more other additives known in the thermoplastics arts. Useful additives include, for example, stabilizers, mold release agents, processing aids, drip retardants, nucleating agents, dyes, pigments, antioxidants, anti-static agents, blowing agents, metal deactivators, antiblocking agents, nanoclays, fragrances (including fragrance-encapsulated polymers), and the like, and combinations thereof. Additives can be added in amounts that do not unacceptably detract from the desired appearance and physical properties of the jacketing composition. Such amounts can be determined by a skilled artisan without undue experimentation.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0094">In some embodiments, the jacketing composition can exclude or be substantially free of components other than those described above. For example, the jacketing composition can be substantially free of other polymeric materials, such as homopolystyrenes (including syndiotactic polystyrenes), polyamides, polyesters, polycarbonates, and polypropylene-graft-polystyrenes. In this context, the term âsubstantially freeâ means that none of the specified component is intentionally added.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0095">As the jacketing composition is defined as comprising multiple components, it will be understood that each component is chemically distinct, particularly in the instance that a single chemical compound may satisfy the definition of more than one component.</p>

      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0335">The cable samples were bent and checked for wrinkles on the cable surface. Results were recorded as âserious wrinkling,â âsome wrinkling,â and almost no wrinkling.â âSerious wrinkling (+)â means that there was substantial wrinkling in the jacketing compositions. âSome wrinkling (++)â means that wrinkling was readily noticeable to the observer. âAlmost no wrinkling (+++)â means that very little wrinkling was noticeable to the observer.</p>

      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0336">Table 3 summarizes the testing results. The formulations varied in terms of PP loading, from 0 weight percent (Comparative Example 1) to approximately 2 weight percent (Example 3), 5 weight percent (Examples 5 and 7) and 7-8 weight percent (Examples 3, 6, 8, and 9). The samples were evaluated for wrinkling upon bending and the samples were scored for wrinkling as provided above.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0337">When PP loading was less than 2 percent wrinkling was serious (Examples 1 and 4). When PP loading was increased to about 5 percent, there were still some wrinkles on the bent cable (Examples 2, 5, and 7), but the appearance was much better than that with jacketing compositions containing less than 2 weight percent (Comparator Examples 1 and 4). Finally, there were almost no wrinkles on the surface of bent cables when the PP loading was increased to about 7-8 weight percent (Examples 3, 6, 8, and 9).</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0338">The Table 3 data also indicates that compositions may contain a range of colorants (Examples 2, 3, 5-8) or be colorant-free (Example 9), as long as PP loading was maintained at or above approximately 3 percent.</p>
