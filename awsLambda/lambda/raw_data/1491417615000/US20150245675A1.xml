      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a goggle and face mask assembly, and more specifically to a goggle and face mask assembly that protects the user from harsh weather conditions and/or debris while enabling easy and quick release of the face protection for purposes including oral communication.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Alpine skiing is a popular outdoor sports activity that is normally performed in subfreezing temperatures. During alpine skiing, a skier descends a snow-covered slope of a mountain. Upon reaching the base, the skier can be brought to the mountain peak again through conventional power-operated conveyances. This cycle may be repeated a number of times during a given day. Unfortunately for skiers, the compounding of environmental conditions, like subfreezing temperature and increased weather harshness with increasing altitude and during ascent and descent, compromise the wellbeing and enjoyment of the skier. Those areas which are prone to suffer most from the harsh environmental conditions are those of the skier not shielded by a thermally insulating fabric layer, as, for example, the skier's face.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">One way skiers protect their faces from the harsh conditions is by wearing a helmet. While wearing a helmet equipped with a faceplate, the user's eyes are protected from debris and the user's face is protected from the harsh weather. Perhaps most importantly, helmets also protect skiers from head injuries.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Not all skiers opt to wear helmets. When a skier who is wearing a helmet wants to talk to someone else, the skier must remove the faceplate, if possible. If not, he must disengage all the securing mechanisms of the helmet and then remove the helmet, during which time the skier's vision is obstructed. Once the helmet is removed, the user's eyes are again exposed to debris and the harsh weather, both of which are exacerbated by high wind velocity relative to the user when the user is descending the slope at high speeds. Ultimately, this means that a skier who wears a helmet will have trouble speaking with the helmet on, and cannot remove the helmet while descending the slopes because of the visual obstruction during removal and ocular and facial exposure to the harsh weather and debris. Helmets are also costly and relatively difficult to put on and remove.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">To more easily communicate, or to save money, some skiers choose to only wear goggles, forgoing the protection and cost of a helmet. However, in doing so, these skiers are protecting only their eyes from the harsh weather and debris. Their face, particularly their nose and mouth regions, is exposed to the harsh elements. This calculus is performed not only by alpine skiers, but anyone who wishes to protect his or her face, like bicyclists and motorcyclists, skateboarders, rollerbladers, and so on.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present invention solves the problem of skiers having to choose between significant face protection coupled with difficulty in communication and high purchase price, and ease in communication with low purchase price but minimal face protection.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The present invention protects a user's face whiling enabling the user to easily communicate by allowing the user to quickly and easily reveal his or her mouth. For example, in one embodiment, goggle-mask assembly comprises a goggle, face-mask comprising a kerchief and support structure, and a plurality of magnets to attach the face-mask to the goggles. In this embodiment, the user of the goggle-mask assembly has his or her mouth covered by the kerchief with the kerchief attached to the goggle. The user can also, using for example his or her hands, remove the kerchief partially or completely in order to reveal his or her mouth, for example to speak clearly to a companion. Once the user wishes to cover his or her mouth again, for example to protect his or her mouth from the harsh environment, magnetic means for attaching the kerchief to the goggle allow the user to re-cover his or her mouth without additional tools, and do so quickly and easily.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">While the present description sets forth specific details of various embodiments, it will be appreciated that the description is illustrative only and should not be construed in any way as limiting.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">Eye, Headwear: Goggles</heading>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">
        <figref>FIGS. 1-5</figref> illustrate a preferred embodiment, the goggle-mask assembly <b>10</b> with a tubular fabric face-mask <b>12</b>. This preferred embodiment incorporates eyewear, such as goggles <b>14</b>, sunglasses, and prescriptions. The eyewear can be any adornment worn above the bottom of the user's lips. Well-known by those with knowledge in the art, goggles <b>14</b> and other eyewear can be constructed a number of ways while still providing its purpose. For example, and without limiting the embodiments, the frame <b>16</b> may be metal or may be plastic. The frame <b>16</b> may even include, among other elements, a rubber component. The goggle <b>14</b> must merely serve the function of protecting a portion of the user's face or head while not completely obstructing the view of the user.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">The Face-Mask</heading>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The present invention is designed to have a connection, immediate or otherwise, between goggles <b>14</b> and a face-mask <b>12</b> where the face-mask <b>12</b> protects the mouth and/or nose region of the user while the face-mask <b>12</b> can be manipulated to expose user's mouth and/or nose region. Well-known by those with knowledge in the art, the face-mask <b>12</b> can be constructed a number of ways while still providing its purpose of protecting the mouth and/or nose region of the user. For example, and without limiting the embodiments, the face-mask <b>12</b> can be manufactured from either hard or soft protective material <b>18</b>. Examples of hard protective material <b>18</b> include metal or plastic, or even tempered glass. Examples of soft protective material <b>18</b> include fabric, cloth, textiles or any other flexible material. For example, the present invention may be embodied by using a kerchief as the protective material <b>18</b> as part of the face-mask <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The protective material <b>18</b> can be implemented to prevent the protective material <b>18</b> from falling off the user. For example, the protective material <b>18</b> may be a fabric sleeve, which is vertically tubular. This example is shown in all drawings, <figref>FIGS. 1-11</figref>. This sleeve can slide over the user's head and onto the user's neck not unlike putting on a T-shirt. This kind of embodiment prevents the face-mask <b>12</b> from falling off the user. Another embodiment that achieves this purpose is one where the protective material <b>18</b> is restricted from falling off the user by being fastened behind the user's head or neck, by any means of fastening. The face-mask <b>12</b> may consist of the protective material <b>18</b>. However, face-masks may comprise protective material <b>18</b> that is supported by a securing frame <b>20</b> (a component that is distinct from the goggle frame <b>16</b>). This securing frame <b>20</b> can provide structure to the protective material <b>18</b> and/or protect the user's face. The securing frame <b>20</b> also provides a foundation for whatever means of attachment is used to connect the face-mask <b>12</b> to the goggles <b>14</b> (or whatever eye or headpiece is used in the embodiment). Although illustrated in the drawings, the securing frame <b>20</b> is not a requirement in an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="2">The Face-Mask: Windowed</heading>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Another preferred embodiment is illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 6-9</figref> The face-mask <b>12</b> may also comprise a window within the protective material <b>18</b>. In this kind of embodiment, the face-mask <b>12</b> may have a securing frame <b>20</b> that also provides a window frame <b>22</b> (also distinct from the goggle frame <b>16</b>). The window frame <b>22</b> enables a window in the protective material <b>18</b> that exposes the user to the outside environment. A window cover <b>24</b> complements the window frame <b>22</b>. The window cover <b>24</b> detachably connects to the window-frame <b>22</b>, at which time the user is less exposed to the outside environment. Any means of attachment can be used to detachably connect the window cover <b>24</b> to the window frame <b>22</b>. For example, the window frame <b>22</b> and the window cover <b>24</b> may be lined with magnets <b>26</b> in a way that enables detachable connection between the two.</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="2">Goggle/Face-Mask Attachment: Magnets</heading>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">One way in which the face-mask <b>12</b> can be detachably connected to the goggles <b>14</b> is by using magnets <b>26</b>. In <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the goggles <b>14</b> has fixed upon it a nose piece <b>28</b>. In this embodiment, two magnets <b>26</b> are attached to a nose-piece <b>28</b> that is fastened to the goggles <b>14</b> near where the goggles <b>14</b> rests upon the user's nose. Although here there are two magnets <b>26</b>, and they attached to the nose-piece <b>28</b>, which in turn is attached the bottom of the goggles <b>14</b>, the magnets <b>26</b> need not be in a set of two nor affixed on a nose piece <b>28</b>. The magnets <b>26</b> can be affixed anywhere on the goggles <b>14</b> including, but not limited to, anywhere on the goggle frame <b>16</b>, anywhere on the lens, anywhere on the securing strap of the goggle <b>14</b>, or any combination thereof. The goggles <b>14</b>, or any piece or attachment thereof, can also be magnetized instead of attaching magnets <b>26</b> to the goggles <b>14</b>. The magnets <b>26</b> can even be affixed to headwear, like a cap, a beanie, ear muffs, or headphones (not shown).</p>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="2">Goggle/Face-Mask Attachment: Hooks</heading>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In <figref>FIGS. 10-12</figref>, the face-mask <b>12</b> has hooks <b>30</b> attached to its securing frame <b>20</b>. These hooks <b>30</b> serve to supplement or supplant the magnetic <b>26</b> attachment mechanism described above. The hooks <b>30</b> grab onto the goggles <b>14</b>. The hooks <b>30</b> need not grab onto goggles <b>14</b>, but any adornment that would serve to supplement or supplant the magnetic <b>26</b> attachment mechanism described above. The hooks <b>30</b> themselves can be any means of grabbing onto an adornment.</p>
      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="2">Goggle/Face-Mask Attachment: Combination and Others</heading>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The purpose of the magnets <b>26</b> is function as a means to fasten the face-mask <b>12</b> to the goggles <b>14</b> an embodiment of the present invention. Although in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the means for fastening the face-mask <b>12</b> to the nose piece <b>30</b> is four magnets <b>26</b> (two magnets <b>26</b> on the nose piece <b>28</b> and two magnets <b>26</b> comprised in the face-mask <b>12</b>), any means for fastening, now invented or invented in the future, can be used to fasten the face-mask <b>12</b> to the goggles <b>14</b>. For example, the means for fastening can be: one or more hook-and-loop fasteners; one or more snap fasteners; one or more zippers; one or more button and shank assemblies; one or more means of clamping, friction-fitting; and; semi-permanent adhesive (not shown here). Moreover, any means for fastening can be used to affix the means for fastening the goggles <b>14</b> to the face-mask <b>12</b>. For example, adhesive (not shown) can be used to affix magnets <b>26</b> to the goggles <b>14</b>, or adhesive (not shown) could be used to affix magnets <b>26</b> onto a nose piece <b>30</b>, which is in turn affixed via adhesive (not shown) onto the goggles <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">More than one means for fastening the goggles <b>14</b> to the face-mask <b>12</b> can be used in a single embodiment of the invention. For example, a magnet <b>26</b> may be used in conjunction with a zipper (not shown) to fasten the face-mask <b>12</b> to the goggles <b>14</b>. In using this illustrative embodiment, the user can tear away only the portion of the face-mask <b>12</b> fastened by the magnet <b>26</b> while resting assured that the face-mask <b>12</b> easily re-attachable to the goggles <b>14</b>, in part because the magnet <b>26</b> allows for easy reconnection, but also because the portion of the face-mask <b>12</b> affixed by the zipper makes sure that the face-mask <b>12</b> does not fall away from the user while ensuring that the portion of the face-mask <b>12</b> with the magnet <b>26</b> is still positioned to line up with the magnet <b>26</b> on the goggles <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">As implied in the illustrative embodiment above, the face-mask <b>12</b> does not need to be completely detachable from the goggles <b>14</b>. For example, a portion of the face-mask <b>12</b> may be permanently attached to the goggles <b>14</b> while the remainder of the face-mask <b>12</b> hangs loosely unless affixed by a means for fastening that allows the user the easily connect the face-mask <b>12</b> to the goggles <b>14</b>. For example, in one embodiment the face-mask <b>12</b> may be permanently affixed to the goggles <b>14</b> near its securing strap connection on one side while a magnet <b>26</b> is affixed to the bottom of the goggles <b>14</b> near the securing strap connection on the other side. In this illustrative embodiment, the user can detach a portion of the face-mask <b>12</b> thereby revealing the user's mouth, for example to speak more easily. Once a part of the face-mask <b>12</b> is detached, the user would not have not hold onto the face-mask <b>12</b> but instead the face-mask <b>12</b> would remain attached to the goggles <b>6</b>. Once the user decides to reattach the face-mask <b>12</b> to the goggles <b>6</b> in full, the user can easily do so by positioning the portion of the face-mask <b>12</b> with a magnet <b>26</b> near the portion of the goggles <b>14</b> with a magnet <b>26</b>. Moreover, one or more means of fastening can be used to keep the face-mask <b>12</b> accessible to the user while the face-mask <b>12</b> is not configured to cover the user's mouth.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The protective material <b>18</b> is affixed, permanently or detachably, to the face-mask <b>12</b>, and the face-mask <b>12</b> connects, permanently or detachably, to the eyewear (e.g. goggles <b>14</b>). An embodiment may have the face-mask <b>12</b> be movable to facilitate communication, or a different embodiment may have only the protective material <b>18</b> be movable with respect to the rest of the facemask <b>12</b>. Any means of fastening can be used, including but not limited to magnets <b>26</b>, hook and loop fasteners, clamps, button and shank assemblies, adhesive, friction fit, or any combination of these or any means for fastening. The eyewear frame <b>16</b> may be also magnetized to serve as a part of or the whole a means for fastening.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">As indicated above, one purpose of the present invention, among other purposes inherent in its design, is to enable a user to quickly and easily reveal and cover his or her mouth. This, among others, is a benefit of the present invention.</p>
