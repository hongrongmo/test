      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">All publications and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Haptic technology is the translation of the sense of touch through technology by applying forces or vibrations to a portion of a user's body. Haptic technology is currently used in a limited fashion in user input devices, such as touch screens, keyboards, computer mice, and joysticks. Basic haptic feedback can be purely mechanical, such as a clicking sensation experienced when a mouse button is depressed with sufficient force. Other devices can be configured to output haptic feedback through the use of electro-mechanical means, such as by activating and/or deactivating one or more motors. For instance, a vibratory sensation can be imparted to an input device by turning an electric motor on and off. Haptic feedback has also been incorporated in video gaming applications, such as where an actuator can output a tactile sensation based on the occurrence of an event, such as in response to a command signal from a game console.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">When referring to teleoperation with sex toys, the term âteledildonicsâ is sometimes used. In short, teledildonics relies on real-time exchange of sensor signals, similar to haptics and tele-operation as performed in the field of robotics as early as the 1950s for military applications like diffusing bombs, or for modern remote surgery.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Sexual stimulation devices (or sex toys) are becoming more accepted by society. However, many sexual stimulated device remain unsophisticated relative to current robotic standards. While in robotics, closed-loop control systems built around sensors and actuators are common, current sexual stimulation devices tend to use very little if any actuators, sensors, or closed-loop control systems. Accordingly, a sexual stimulation device or system that includes more advanced control systems, such as haptic feedback and teledildonics, is desired.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In general, described herein are sexual stimulation apparatuses (including devices and systems). These devices (which can also be referred to as sex toys) generally include a ring having a diameter (inner diameter, outer diameter, or both) that can be modified, as well as a longitudinal axis along which the ring may move axially. In general, these devices also include an axial actuator for moving the ring in the longitudinal axis, as well as a ring diameter actuator for changing the diameter of the ring. The device may also include or more controls for controlling the longitudinal position and diameter of the ring. The control may be automatic or manual, or may be responsive to communication between devices or from a server or other outside source.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The ring may be referred to as a stimulation ring, expandable ring, contracting ring, or the like. The ring may be a toroid, an O-ring, a doughnut shape, or the like. In general, the ring shape is formed having a central opening and a roughly round cross-section (or oval cross-section), however, the ring does not have to be continuous. For example, the ring may be formed of a wire or other member whose ends are separated (and may be coupled to a ring diameter actuator; the ring diameter actuator may expand/contract the ring by increasing or decreasing the length of the material forming the ring. In some variations, the ring is expandable/contractible by a ring diameter actuator that inflates/deflates (e.g., pneumatically, hydraulically, etc.) the ring. In general, the ring may be covered or surrounded by one or more elements or covers, including a membrane or the like. A cover may generally be configured to expand/contract with the ring. In general, either the ring, the ring diameter actuator, or both may also include one or more sensors for detecting the diameter, or a change in the diameter of the ring. In some variations, a ring diameter sensor may be used in a feedback look for controlling the diameter of the ring.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The longitudinal axis of the apparatus may generally be formed by an elongate member than can be structured as either an inner member (e.g., rod, axel, central member, tube, arm, beam, boom, column, elongate body, etc.) or an outer member (e.g., tube, pipe, hose, duct, channel, frame, etc.). The elongate member(s) forming the longitudinal axis may act as a track along which the ring can move axially, and may therefore be referred to as a track member forming the longitudinal axis. The track member may be configured so that it couples to the ring. The ring can move while remaining perpendicular to the track member as it moves in the proximal to distal direction along the track member. The track member may generally be straight, bent, curved, or the like, while extending in an axial to distal direction. The track member is generally rigid, though in some variations it may be flexible. The track member may form part of the actuator, and may include gears, gearing, cables, or other engagement regions or members to which an axial actuator can engage to drive the ring member proximally and/or distally.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">For example, in some variations the track member (e.g., an elongate member and/or sleeve member) may be configured so that the stimulation ring controllable slides proximally and distally as driven by the axial actuator. The axial actuator may include one or more mechanical drivers (e.g., gears, pulleys, etc.), electrical/magnetic drivers (magnets, inductors, etc.), and/or pneumatic/hydraulic drivers, or the like. In general, these devices may be configured so that the movements (axial and/or ring diameter) are controlled by a controller.</p>

      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 1A-3B</figref>, a female device <b>100</b> includes an elongate body <b>101</b> and a ring <b>103</b> configured to translate along the elongate body <b>101</b> and constrict over the elongate body <b>101</b>. The elongate body <b>101</b> can include an open-ended tubular member <b>221</b> (i.e., having an opening or channel therein) and an inner sleeve <b>223</b> within the opening or channel. The sleeve <b>223</b> can be attachable and detachable from the tubular member <b>221</b>. The tubular member <b>221</b> can be made of Teflon and can have a sock-like shape with a flange at the proximal end (the sleeve <b>223</b> can be attached to the flange). The tubular member <b>221</b> can further be pleated or otherwise compressible so as to allow constriction thereof. The sleeve <b>223</b> can be made of a soft, pliable materials, such as mineral gel oil. For example, the sleeve <b>223</b> can be made of a flesh-like material having a durometer of between 5 and 40 shoreA or 10-50 ShoreOO. The opening or channel within the elongate body <b>101</b> can be configured to mimic a portion of female anatomy, such as a vaginal canal.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The ring <b>103</b> can be made of a plastic material, such as polytetrafluoroethylene, and can include a shuttle <b>331</b> attached thereto. The shuttle <b>331</b> can be connected to a shuttle cable <b>335</b>. Further, a pulley arrangement in the device <b>100</b> can allow a translation actuator or motor <b>339</b> to wind the shuttle cable <b>335</b> on a capstan <b>333</b>, thereby providing translation of the shuttle <b>331</b> and the ring <b>103</b>. A tensioning spring can provide the required tension on the shuttle cable <b>335</b> to allow the capstan <b>333</b> to transfer power to the shuttle cable <b>335</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">In some embodiments, the device <b>100</b> can include a rotation encoder <b>367</b>, such as an incremental two channel optical encoder, to sense the position of the motor <b>339</b>, and thus sense the position of the ring <b>103</b>. The device <b>100</b> can further include a controller <b>881</b> (see <figref>FIG. 17</figref>), such as a small printed circuit board, configured to run a control loop to keep the shuttle <b>331</b> position located at the target commanded location along the longitudinal axis <b>105</b> of the device <b>100</b>. Using information from the sensors <b>267</b>, the controller <b>881</b> can control the location of the shuttle <b>331</b>, thereby controlling the axial location of the ring <b>103</b>. The controller <b>881</b> can be capable of slewing the ring <b>103</b> from one position to another at speeds at least as high as would be measured for actual copulation. For example, the controller <b>881</b> can slew the ring <b>103</b> from proximal end to distal end and back in &lt;0.5 seconds and can have a frequency response of &gt;5 Hz. The device <b>100</b> can, for example, reproduce and transduce sensed forces from 0 Hz to greater than 10 Hz with a frequency response from DC to 100 Hz.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The ring <b>103</b> can include a constriction cable <b>341</b> running therethrough. Further, the shuttle <b>331</b> can include a pulley <b>343</b>, which can be connected to the constriction cable <b>341</b>. A separate control system including a constriction actuator or motor <b>349</b> can be configured to real the constriction cable <b>341</b> in and out at the same rate as the shuttle cable <b>335</b>, thereby keeping tension in the ring substantially constant. An encoder <b>883</b>, such as an optical encoder, can detect the relative position of the constriction cable <b>341</b>, and thus of the amount of constriction of the ring <b>103</b>. The controller <b>881</b> can modulate tension in ring <b>103</b> to constrict and relax the ring <b>103</b> from a diameter of approximately 15 mm fully closed to an open diameter of approximately 60 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In one embodiment, the ring <b>103</b> can be comprised of two telescoping tubes, such as 1/16â³ OD Teflon tubes of 30 mm length, inserted into the shuttle <b>331</b> at one end and into a larger ââ³OD Teflon tube at their other ends. The constriction cable <b>341</b> can be terminated at one end on the shuttle <b>331</b> by a crimp, pass through the telescoping tubes, re-enter the shuttle <b>331</b>, loop around the pulley <b>343</b>, and exit the shuttle for connection to a capstan <b>344</b> connected to the motor <b>349</b>. As the constriction cable <b>341</b> is tensioned, the tube assembly of the ring <b>103</b> also constricts.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In some embodiments, a fixed length outer cable sheath can be placed between the shuttle <b>331</b> and the pulley system. The fixed length sheath can be helically wound around the elongate body <b>101</b>, winding and unwinding as the shuttle <b>331</b> is translated. This fixed length outer cable sheath can advantageously reduce the need for the controller to keep track of slack or initialize the position of the ring <b>103</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The controller <b>881</b> can be configured to constrict and relax the ring <b>103</b> rapidly similar to real muscular response of a pubococcygeus muscle in a vaginal canal. Further, because the two controlled axes are independent, the ring <b>103</b> is able to travel along the elongate body <b>101</b> while also expanding and contracting as desired. The tubular member <b>221</b> provides a very low friction barrier between the insert <b>223</b> and the moving ring <b>103</b>. With this arrangement, the user experiences realistic constriction along an anatomically realistic length.</p>

      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">In some embodiments, a position sensor <b>885</b> can be used to determine the penetration position or penetration of a user, e.g., the user's penis, into the device <b>100</b>. The sensor <b>885</b> can be, for example, an accelerometer that, in combination with double integration, provides a penetration or position control variable output signal to be sent to a paired device. That is, the accelerometer, when doubled integrated, can detect a relative change in distance of the accelerometer, and thus a change in distance of the user relative to the device <b>100</b>, over time. This change in distance over time can be used to detect the relative penetration of the user, e.g., of the user's penis. This penetration distance can then be output to a paired device, as described further below. In some embodiments, the position sensor <b>885</b> can be mounted on a printed circuit board, such as on the controller <b>881</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The motors <b>339</b>, <b>349</b>, sensor <b>885</b>, encoders <b>367</b>, <b>883</b>, and various pulleys and cables can advantageously be located outside sleeve <b>223</b> by virtue of the cable routing/mechanism design described herein. The tubular member <b>221</b> advantageously provides needed friction control as well as a moisture barrier. This design can be complimentary and compatible with the existing high volume shipping female-like products. The form factor for the device can be additive in applications to realize a full robotic system capable of simulating intercourse.</p>

The ring <b>103</b> can change diameter based on the level and rate of change of pressure measured in a paired device. Firmware scaling, use of differentiator op-amp circuit, and other firmware means can modify the magnitude and rate of constriction. In one embodiment, the ring <b>103</b> mimics the tightness of the vaginal canal of the woman using the paired device. Further, the sensors can be used to convey information regarding the constriction or placement of the ring <b>103</b> to a paired device.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">In some embodiments, the device <b>100</b> can be run both in a âpaired mode,â i.e., actuate in response to a paired device and a âmanual mode,â i.e. actuate without signals from a paired device.

      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 4-7</figref>, a male device <b>400</b> includes a curved prismatic body <b>401</b> rotatable coupled to a handle <b>410</b>. An expandable, e.g., inflatable ring <b>403</b> is translatable along the body <b>401</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The prismatic body <b>401</b> can include a relative soft distal tip <b>471</b> configured to mimic the tip of a male penis. The shaft of the prismatic body <b>401</b> can include a lead screw <b>107</b> therein, which can be connected to a motor <b>439</b>. The ring <b>403</b> can include a translating drive nut <b>771</b> (see <figref>FIG. 7</figref>), such as attached to the balloon <b>773</b>. The nut <b>771</b> can include an anti-rotation pin. The drive nut <b>771</b> can be located around, and translatable along, the lead screw <b>107</b>. Thus, as the lead screw <b>107</b> is rotated by the motor <b>439</b>, the nut <b>771</b>, and thus the ring <b>403</b>, can translate along the elongate body <b>401</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The ring <b>403</b> can further include an expanding diameter balloon <b>773</b>. Thus, the balloon <b>773</b> can have a fluid or air conducting tube <b>449</b> connected to an inflation mechanism <b>447</b> and a sensor <b>445</b> to detect the pressure of the balloon. In one embodiment, the pressure sensor <b>445</b> can be connected to an op-amp differentiator circuit stage that amplifies and differentiates the raw pressure sensor signal from the balloon. This can advantageously boost the change in pressure and remove the offset or constant portion of the pressure signal. The differentiator circuit can include both high and low pass characteristics, allowing for a large output signal for subtle changes in pressure around any given mean pressure and rolling off higher frequencies, such as frequencies about 100 Hz. Further, in one embodiment, a pressure differentiator circuit associated with the sensor <b>445</b> can produce a large amplified signal that represents change in balloon pressure. The circuit can be configured such that a basic pressure signal is added to the differentiated signal to form a PD output. Advantageously, this allows some output from the sensor for slowing changing pressure and significant output for rapid changes.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">The ring <b>403</b> can be either passively larger than the prismatic body or actively expanded and contracted to desired or controlled girth, volume, shape, or hardness.

The handle <b>410</b> can be configured to provide ease of holding and control from many angles and positions. The handle <b>410</b> can further included a dented portion configured to sit in between a user's legs. The handle <b>410</b> can include a manual control <b>411</b>, such as a finger pad or button, configured to manually control the position of the ring <b>403</b>. A control potentiometer <b>413</b> can be connected to the control <b>411</b> to change the location of the ring <b>403</b>. In addition to use in manual mode, the translation of the ring <b>403</b> can be controlled automatically in response to features of a paired device, as further described below. The handle <b>410</b> can further include a vibrating element <b>451</b> suspended at least in part in the sheath <b>441</b>. The vibrating element <b>451</b> can be, for example, an eccentric rotating mass vibration motor or can be a motor grounded to the handle <b>410</b> through a living hinge. In some embodiments, a female user can position the vibrating element by onto the clitoris by adjusting the rotatable shaft position. The handle <b>410</b> can further include the inflation mechanism <b>447</b>, which can inflate with a piston and deflate with a pressure relief valve to control inflation of the balloon <b>773</b>. The inflation can be controlled, for example, through a pneumatic module having a piston, two check valves, and a release button. In one embodiment, the user can push the piston about 10 times to inflate the balloon to about 60 mm diameter and press a release button to deflate it.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The prismatic body <b>401</b>, lead screw, <b>407</b>, and ring <b>403</b> can be enclosed within a fleshâlike stretchable sheath <b>441</b> made, for example, of a material having a durometer of between 5 and 40 shoreA or 10-50 ShoreOO, e.g., a material made of mineral gel oil. In some embodiments, the sheath <b>441</b> can enclose a friction reducing lubricant.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">A controller <b>991</b> (see <figref>FIG. 17</figref>) can be configured to be responsive to pressure or constriction of the balloon housed under the sheath and/or prepare telemetry signals to send over telephonic or internet connection to a paired device designed to respond to the signals. Further, an encoder <b>454</b> can be used to detect the position of the ring <b>403</b> (via a measurement of the rotation angle of the lead screw). The detected position <b>454</b> can be used as an input for closed-loop control by the controller <b>991</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">Thus, the lead screw <b>407</b>, nut <b>741</b>, motor <b>439</b>, encoder <b>454</b>, and controller <b>991</b> provide closed loop position control of the translation and expansion of the ring <b>403</b>. Either local control via the pressure sensitive control interface or remote control can set the target position of the translating ring. The device <b>400</b> is advantageously capable of high bandwidth transduction of realistic intercourse simulating insertion with slew rate from proximal to distal end in &lt;0.5 seconds with a bandwidth of &gt;5 Hz. The device <b>400</b> can, for example, reproduce and transduce sensed forces from 0 Hz to greater than 10 Hz with a frequency response from DC to 100 Hz</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">In some embodiments, the device <b>500</b> can include an electromechanical inflation means that would be responsive to a remote control signal. In some embodiments, the user can expand or inflate the ring to desired girth and then experience either local control of translation or remote control of translation (such as in response to signals from a paired device). The device <b>400</b> can thus be a stand-alone device or remotely controlled.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">The device <b>400</b> can further include a pressure sensor <b>445</b> to measure the pressure or inflation of the ring <b>403</b>. The pressure sensor <b>445</b>, in combination with an amplification circuit and differentiation circuit response to the change in pressure, can provide a signal proportional to the rate of change of pressure. Because tighter vaginal canals would naturally produce higher pressure offsets in the signal, differentiation can eliminate DC offsets and effectively generate a AC coupled signal that is a change in pressure signal. The pressure signal generated can be sent to a paired device, such as to a paired female device, to control the features of the paired device. In one embodiment, the ring <b>403</b> mimics the hardening or expansion of the penis of a man using the paired device.</p>

The sensor <b>452</b> can be, for example, an accelerometer that, in combination with double integration, provides a penetration or position control variable output signal to be sent to a paired device. That is, the accelerometer, when doubled integrated, can detect a relative change in distance of the accelerometer, and a change in distance of the user relative to the device <b>400</b>, over time. This change in distance over time can be used to detect the relative penetration of the device into the user, e.g., into the user's vagina.

      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="2">Sensor Technology</heading>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Various sensors can be included on the devices <b>100</b>, <b>400</b> in addition to, or in place of, the sensors described above. These sensors can sense or monitor both physical signals and sexual effectiveness signals.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">Physical signals from the devices <b>100</b>, <b>400</b> can include measurements of position, velocity, acceleration, frequency, orientation, length, circumference, stiffness, pressure, force, etc. These physical qualities may be represented in absolute or relative scales. In the preferred embodiment, a device may have a plurality of sensors arranged in a way that enables combined sensor signals to be measured, similar to how quadrature encoders combine signals from multiple phased emitter/detector pairs.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">The devices <b>100</b>, <b>400</b> (or other similar devices) can further include additional sensors to measure sexual effectiveness. Historically, ECG or EEG, respiration rate, breathing exertion (see sleep studies), blood oxygen saturation, have all been used to sense degree of sexual arousal and climax. Blood flow sensors such as âphotoplethysmographâ or muscle activity sensors âelectromyographyâ, have been used in the past. Moisture sensors could be used as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">The physical sensors can be used for monitoring stroke rate and force over time, in order to identify sexual climax. It is expected that these parameters would progressively increase over time until a peak is detected, then quickly fall off once climax was achieved. There may be lag between orgasm and when the sensors identify the downslope. There may be false positives if a user gets tired and stops, or is interrupted.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">Heart rate may also be used as an assessment of degree of stimulation of a user. Heart rate increases with sexual stimulation and decreases after orgasm. If our novel sensors are designed to offer high sensitivity in the 40-240 Hz bandwidth, they may be used to sense heartbeat.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">Temperature sensors can be used to measure temperature, which increases with increased blood flow to the penis or vaginal areas as accompanied with sexual arousal. By configuring our novel strain sensor not to strain due to physical perturbation, any sensed strain must come from thermal strain.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">In some embodiments, users can give input to identify orgasm to more finely tune the devices. One inexpensive and reliable way to do this is to allow the user to give feedback via UI on the sex toy, for instance, the âorgasm buttonâ. User may press the orgasm buttonâeven bang on it to communicate stronger effectâif she wants to âstarâ a session for later playback, or communicate to her partner of the success they achieved together. The controls or servers used with the devices may also benefit from knowing this feedback, e.g. which sorts of inputs are helpful for pre-orgasmic women to progress through a therapeutic plan.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">One type of physical sensor that can be used is a semi-conductive elastomeric sensor to detect a change in strain of a portion of the device (such as the inner sleeve <b>223</b> of the device <b>100</b> or the sheath <b>441</b> of the device <b>400</b>).

The semi-conductive layer <b>803</b> can include a semi-conductive rubber material, such 3M's Scotch <b>13</b> tape. The substrate <b>801</b> can apply the pressure required to electrically bind fine wire connections of the sensor <b>800</b> to the semi-conductive tape. By placing contacts on the semi-conductive layer <b>803</b> and then stretching it, the layer <b>803</b> advantageously behaves like an unusually compliant force sensitive resistor (FSR). Off the shelf, the substrate material, such as 3M's tape material, can be viscoelastic and thus mechanically weak and unstable over time. When sandwiched within a substrate <b>801</b>, e.g. self-fusing silicone tape, latex rubber, or molded silicone, the semi-conductive tape layer <b>803</b> can advantageously be stabilized to realize repeatable operation as a sensor <b>800</b>, tolerating repeated cycles and returning to its original shape after deformation.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">Advantageously, addition of electrodes <b>805</b> in the lamination merely requires pressure, not solder or laser weld or other, to make reliable electrical contact between the semi-conductive tape <b>801</b> and electrical connections. Advantageously, the resulting sensor <b>800</b> can be soft, pliable, formable or moldable into various shapes and structures, and electrically connected in an unobtrusive way. Advantageously, through the use of thin materials, such as materials made by dip molding, the sensors described herein can be used for a sexual devices, such as devices <b>100</b> or <b>400</b> or a condom, to incorporate an array of sensors that respond to the various nuances of sexual intercourse.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">Springs in parallel work additively. If the anatomy is modeled to have a spring stiffness Ka and the sensor/substrate is modeled to have a spring stiffness Ks, we want Ks to be a) equivalent to, or b) substantially less than, Ka. This requirement is important to ensure that the sensor/substrate a) feel like naturally mating anatomy, or b) are substantially unnoticeable and unimposing, respectively. The sensors described herein can advantageously meet both of these requirements.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">In one embodiment, the sensors described herein, such as sensor <b>800</b>, can be manufactured by wrapping a layer of self-fusing silicone tape around a mandrel. Then, the semi-conductive tape can be laminated to the silicone tape. Lastly, another layer of silicone tape can be laminated on top of the semi-conductive tape. The mandrel, can be first covered with a layer of Teflon tape to help the sticky silicone layer to slide off the mandrel.</p>

        <i>a </i>shows the simplest embodiment of a sensor <b>800</b> where two electrodes <b>805</b><i>a,b </i>are placed along the semi-conductive layer <b>803</b>. The resistance can be measured between them, such as by using a voltage divider. The electrodes <b>803</b><i>a,b </i>may be widened to pick up average strain over a larger section of material if desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">Referring to <figref>FIG. 8</figref><i>b</i>, in some embodiments, multiple sensors can be formed by placing more than two electrodes <b>805</b><i>a,b,c,d </i>on the same laminate. By having more electrodes in the same area, such as an array of sensors, higher resolution per area can be obtained. As shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref><i>b</i>, the electrodes <b>805</b> can be arranged linearly to track a single strain direction. In contrast, as shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref><i>c</i>, electrodes <b>805</b> can be arranged on the laminate in a more complex array to track different directions of strain and shape deformation. In this scenario, the multiple electrodes can be multiplexed.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 9</figref><i>a</i>-<b>9</b><i>e</i>, one basic deployment strategy is to form ring sensors <b>900</b> with the laminate <b>901</b>/<b>903</b> and electrodes <b>905</b>. In one embodiment (shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>), these rings can be placed along a phallic shaped device that could be inserted into anatomy, say vaginally or anally. In another embodiment (shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref><i>b</i>), these rings could be placed on a device designed to accept the introduction of anatomy, such as a penis. For example, when the penis is inserted and the rings expand, strain can be sensed in the form of a resistance change described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">Further, as shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref><i>c</i>, multiple ring shaped sensors can be grouped together into an array that can sense, for example, the amount of insertion of a penis over time or the degree of insertion of a phallic device into the vagina. By looking at the correlation in âstrain from baselineâ between sensor pairs, the tip of the penis can be localized. Once this degree of insertion is known, it is also straightforward to determine velocity of insertion by computing change in degree of insertion over time. Stroke length can also be computed by observing the extent of position between direction changes. Measuring the time between direction changes can yield stroke frequency.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">Referring to <figref>FIG. 9</figref><i>d</i>, in some embodiments, a history of motion can be computer and recorded by an onboard microprocessor dedicated to reading this information from a single sensor or group of sensors <b>905</b>. The onboard microprocessor will also be used to access stored calibration and configuration data for each sensor, in order to make its measurements. It can also do requisite multiplexing.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">Ring-shaped sensors can advantageously detect both localized force (as shown by the force arrow <b>911</b> in <figref>FIG. 9</figref><i>d</i>) and radial force (as shown by the force arrows <b>913</b> in <figref>FIG. 9</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">Thus, in one embodiment, localization can be obtained by looking at relative difference in signal between an adjacent pair of sensors according to equation 1:</p>

      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0102">In some embodiments, it can be useful to track strain over time for a single âCâ or ring-shaped shaped sensor, such as in order to measure the growth of penis girth or constriction of a vagina. With semi-conductive tape laminated to an elastic (non-plastic) substrate of well-characterized stiffness, accurate readings on girth of penis or vagina can advantageously be made.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0103">In some embodiments, stiffness can also be measured. Stiffness is the displacement measured in response to force applied. If an actuator is collocated with one of these ring sensors <b>900</b>, the actuator can be commanded to produce a known force. The ring sensor <b>900</b> output can in turn be measured to find the tissue displacement. It may be important to subtract the displacement-per-force when no tissue is present, in order not to measure the substrate stiffness.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0104">As noted above, localized force or pressure can be measured in addition to position and shape sensors. For example, such calculations can be useful in determining how much force is being applied by the base of a man's penis at the entrance to a simulated vagina. The semi-conductive material is naturally a force sensor, but it works better in stretching than compression. Two approaches may be pursued: laminating the semi-conductive material to a cantilevered substrate of known stiffness, or placing the semi-conductive material on an inflexible substrate so that force compresses the material. Either of these lamination stacks can be placed in regions where force information is desired, like at the base of the penis.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0105">
        <figref>FIG. 9</figref>
        <i>e </i>shows how arrays of these sensors can be extended to very high resolution and broad areas. In this manner, a fully instrumented condom could be constructed. Flexible, electrically conductive ink could be the key to realizing this design.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0106">The ring sensor <b>900</b> can have optimum sensitivity, dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and bandwidth. In one exemplary embodiment, the sensor <b>900</b> is formed into a band of approximately 40 mm diameter and 10 mm width. Only grams of force can be required to begin to see change in resistance. The resulting signal can swing dramatically from 5 Mohm to 1 Mohm with only Ë10% diameter strain. Deformations such as twisting and collapsing the band advantageously have very little effect on the output signal, while stretching produces a large signal. This behavior, that the sensor produces large output from desired strains while rejecting motions that could potentially produce unwanted signal (noise), is highly desirable and makes for an excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Bandwidth is inherently very high for an analog sensor like this, but the ultimate practical limit to how quickly successive measurements are made is how quickly the whole sandwich (supporting material+semi-conductive sensor) can rebound. The rebound can be controlled carefully through use of the substrate <b>901</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0107">Parameterized sensor output can be applied, for example, by storing it for replay, analyzing it to ascertain populations of anatomical features or sexual behaviors/experiences, sending it over the wire for replication by a slave actuator set, or communicating it real-time for full duplex teleoperation.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0108">To transmit data, each sensor value can be individually sent to a slave or tele-operated device. Alternately, to reduce payload, sensor values maybe parameterized into an equation through a fitting process, perhaps done within the microprocessor. Position as degree of insertion (P), stroke length (Â£), stroke frequency (f), phase or mapping (Ï), can form parameters of oscillatory equation 2:</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]<i>P=l </i>sin(2Ï<i>ft</i>+Ï).ââ(equation 2)[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0109">Then, in one embodiment, no matter how many sensors are in a device, only these few parameters need be sent. A paired device, perhaps with different sensor or actuator count, can deploy the received parameters to replicate the experience given its own unique configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0110">In some embodiments, the sensors <b>800</b>/<b>900</b> described herein can be wrapped helically around a hollow cylindrical body and can be attached either at the ends or continuously along the elongate body. The sensor can thus be responsive to strain by local and accumulated expansion of cylinder. The helical arrangement can be advantageous, for example, because as a penis is inserted into canal, incremental portions of the semi-conductive sensor will stretch and accumulate a total strain, causing a total measurable resistance change that is proportional to insertion depth.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0111">In some embodiments, the sensors <b>800</b>, <b>900</b> can be a silk screened assembly of highly electrically conductive row and column electrodes, insulated from each other where they cross over, where each row is joined to a column by N semi conductive silk screen printed regions. The processor can poll each row and column and read the resistance of each element to build an image of strain and pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0112">The sensors described herein are safe and low-cost sensor are extremely well suited to measure biometric/physiological interactions between a human and a human-operated device. When incorporated into a device such as a sex toy, or even a diagnostic or therapeutic medical instrument, organized interrogation of these sensors can measure position, as degree of insertion: into the vagina, over the penis, or with respect to other anatomy that comes in contact with the device, location of a point contact with the device, force/pressure of a point contact with the device, stroke length, stroke velocity, stroke frequency, anatomical length, as length of penis, vaginal canal, anus, etc., anatomical girth, as diameter of penis, vaginal canal, anus, etc., change in anatomical length or girth, such as when aroused for sex or engaging in sex, and/or localized issue stiffness, when paired with a calibrated actuator that is capable of displacing both the tissue around the device and the devices sensor, simultaneously.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0113">The sensors or group(s) of sensors, can be interrogated by a neighboring microprocessor. The microprocessor can be responsible for reading input from individual sensor elements, applying calibration factors and scaling, interpreting each sensor element input with respect to its location on the device, and combining its processed output with the same output from multiple other sensors. In this way, the metrics described above can be measured in suitable absolute or relative sense. Further, the microprocessor may then communicate the metrics over a network for use in the particular application.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0114">The sensors described herein can also include or be paired with other known biometric sensors to measure a broad set of physiological changes that accompany sexual arousal: heart rate, body temperature, blood flow, muscle activity, respiration rate, breathing exertion, moisture, ECG, EEG, blood oxygen saturation, etc. This sum-total sensor data set, or any portion of it, can be used, for example, in a localized control loop within a single device, in a tele-robotic scenario between or among multiple devices, or accumulated across multiple users and use sessions.</p>

For example, the female device <b>100</b> can be configured to determine, through the sensor <b>885</b>, the penetration position of a user into the device. This position can be communicated to a paired male device <b>400</b> to control the position of the ring <b>403</b> through encoder <b>454</b> and the controller <b>991</b>. Simultaneously, the male device <b>400</b> can be configured to determine, through sensors <b>452</b> and <b>445</b>, the penetration position of the device into a user and the pressure of the ring <b>403</b>. The detected position and pressure can be communicated to the paired female device <b>100</b> to control the position and constriction of the ring <b>103</b> through encoders <b>367</b>, <b>883</b> and controller <b>881</b>. Thus, the devices <b>100</b>, <b>400</b> can simultaneously transduce the experience the user would feel if their genitalia were actually engaged in copulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0116">One exemplary control scheme includes: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>1. Female device <b>100</b> directly measures penile penetration into the synthetic vaginal canal and encodes that into a telemetry packet or signal.</li><li>2.

Male device <b>400</b> receives penetration position control signal and servo controls inflatable balloon to commanded position real-time.</li><li>4. Male device <b>400</b> directly measures pressure of translating ring and encodes that pressure into a telemetry packet/signal comprising constriction pressure and position (if the male device <b>400</b> has a helically wrapped semi-conductive sensor strip <b>800</b>, <b>900</b> incorporated into the sheath, then vaginal penetration can be measured directly).</li><li>5. Male device <b>400</b> sends vaginal constriction and penetration depth signals to FL device.</li><li>6. Female device <b>100</b> servos to penetration depth and servo controls constriction to replicate stroke and contraction of vagina.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0123">The communication between the devices <b>100</b>, <b>400</b> can be performed through audio signals with a nominal latency of less than 0.25 seconds over internet connection or telephonic connection. For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 17</figref>, communication can be performed through an audio connection over a voice over internet protocol (VOIP) connection.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0124">The devices <b>100</b>, <b>400</b> can thus include or have connected thereto a tone generation and transmission mechanism, either in firmware or purely electronic, modulated by a control signal whereby a carrier base frequency is increased or decreased by a continuous range in response to the control input. For instance, a 6 KHz frequency generated in firmware, is modulated by adding a variable in firmware that can increase the signal frequency to 7 KHz in steps of one part in 255 in response to a pressure signal from a sensor being read via A/D convertor. This control signal can then be filtered, conditioned, AC coupled, and sent out to a common audio microphone jack. The microphone jack can be the point of interface where a frequency modulated control signal is input to any device with an audio jack connection capable of sending voice signals over a radio or land line connection. For instance, a hand held phone, tablet computer, lap top computer, may all listen to this control signal. When connected to a common VOIP program like Skype, any other device anywhere in the world can âhearâ this signal and the original modulation from the telemetry generated at the remote local processor is faithfully maintained.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0125">At the receiving end, any common device having a connection via Skype or telephone line, with a ubiquitous audio output headphone jack, sends an audio signal out of that port that is a faithful reproduction of the frequency modulated signal.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0126">That FM control signal is passed through a filter, an amplifier, and then a carrier frequency detection and demodulation stage, where the original modulating signal is recovered and turned into an analog voltage with a bandwidth equal to the original sensor a the remote end. That demodulated control signal is then fed into the local processor via A/D convertor at the local receiving device end and recognized by firmware as a control signal for positioning a servo.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0127">Telephony, either via analog connection or internet VOW connection, is typically constrained to a frequency range of 10 to 3400 Hz by very old telephone specifications. Ability to clearly understand speech benefits from frequency content up to 10 KHz. However, it is possible to remove a portion of the frequency range above about 5 KHz and minimally impact speech quality. The audio output that comes out of the audio jack can be intercepted and filtered with a low pass filter to filter out the modulated carrier frequency. That filtered signal drives a pair of headphones or powered speakers that can be connected to each device <b>100</b>, <b>400</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0128">Common electrical signal modulation schemes used alone or in combination, such as Frequency Shift Keying, Pulse Position Modulation, Amplitude Modulation, Frequency Modulation, Sideband Modulation, etc., can be used to send encoded bytes of sensor information and command signals back and forth simultaneously over the existing audio connections in common devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0129">In the case where there is a single sensor and proportional actuator at each end of the network connection, approximately five to ten bytes of data can be sent to and from each end at an update rate of ten times per second. This design can require transferring up to 800 bits per second, which is well under the audio bandwidth capability for the common connection. To improve quality, CRC error checking can be implemented or redundant signals can be sent to ensure performance.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0130">In some embodiments, a single controller can be used to control several actuators and respond to several audio input signal simultaneously.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0131">In one embodiment, where there are two actuators to be controlled with one audio channel, the modulation range can be divided into a low and high band, and then the signals can be alternated based on which one is changing. For example, in the case of the male device <b>400</b>, there is a pressure sensor and an accelerometer signal, so both can be monitored, and whichever one has changed the most in a given time interval will get to be updated. At the female device <b>100</b> end, the controller just knows to pay attention to whether it is a high or low modulation range and steer the signal to the appropriate servo control plant in firmware.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0132">Advantageously, by using an audio connection to transmit signals between paired devices <b>100</b>, <b>500</b>, the communication is performed through a very high bandwidth, low noise, stable, connection that requires one to simply plug in a jack without software requirements.</p>
      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="2">Networking</heading>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0133">In some embodiments, the connection between one or more devices <b>100</b>, <b>400</b> can be made over a network that can relay or record sensor and actuator signals for: (1) later playback, e.g. favorite session, sexual greeting card; (2) broadcast, e.g. one performer to many sexually engaged observers; or (3) analysis, e.g. study of correlation between a devices' position sensor readings to âsexual effectivenessâ sensors on the same patient, or to a remote device's âsexual effectivenessâ readings for a given session/time period.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0134">Referring to <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, the sexual experience obtained from a sex toy (or device <b>100</b>, <b>400</b>) can be shared on a network (sometimes referred to herein as KarmaNet for exemplary purposes) through transmission and activation via sensors on the devices. While the users interact with devices of sex toy form factor, the devices are connected through a network. The network can include, for example, a server, and a chat client.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0135">An exemplary chat client is shown in <figref>FIG. 15</figref>. The purpose of the chat client is twofold: extend the otherwise limited UI of the device, and provide a communication bridge to the server. The chat client can enable users to select from a buddy list and connect via audio, video, text chat. Further, the chat client can know how to find and pair with a device <b>100</b>, <b>400</b>. In the upper left of the chat client shown in <figref>FIG. 15</figref>, the user show as logged in (name appears) and has set his status for other buddies to see. In the upper center, the GUI shows the user as logged in to the server but with no device paired or recognized; once paired to his local sex toy device, this user would be able to enter a session. In the upper right, options for this user's chat modalities can be controlled. For instance, this is where the user would pair with his Karma device and set any controls. In the buddy list, available buddies show as identified by their public aliases. Public aliases may work much like hash tags on Twitter, perhaps always a âkâ (for Karma) prefix. Or, the user who has logged in may ameliorate or replace the fairly anonymous public alias with a more descriptive nickname that shows only to him (it may not be unique, while the public alias is required to be unique because it identifies the user uniquely to other users). For each user, that user's online status is communicated to the left of the user's public alias (or nickname). Scroll over the online buddies to connect via Karma sex toy (leftmost icon). If a buddy is offline, this user's recorded sessions with that buddy may appear.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0136">Several exemplary use cases are presented here for the purpose of explaining primary objectives for the network. These use cases do not intend to define the complete set of foreseeable network features. Rather, they are meant to identify a few core operations that drive fundamental design requirements and establish core intellectual property.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0137">One exemplary use case is an account set-up use case (here, called a KarmaNet account). In the exemplary case, a woman connects to server via web browser. She generates login and password information which will remain private. She is then prompted to enter billing info, which is kept private as well. Lastly, the woman is asked to create a public alias for display to other users. If this woman happens to be a performer, she may later use this public alias to advertise herself.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0138">Referring to <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, another exemplary use case is a peer-to-peer session use case. This use case represents the scenario, for example, in which a husband and wife engage with each other over the network. The husband in London hotel logs in to a chat session via browser or stand-alone app (PC or smart phone) with the intention of engaging his wife in their New York home. The husband turns on power to his/her sex toy or device <b>100</b>, <b>400</b>. Through the chat client, the husband sees his device name come up through the host/server. Husband pairs his chat client with the familiar device. He then looks through his buddy list, where he finds his wife's public alias. He can see from an icon to the left of her name that she her device is paired and ready. He starts a session with her, including video and KarmaNet connection, but not audio.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0139">Referring to <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, another exemplary use case is a performer broadcast use case. For example, a female performer wishes to perform to a male audience. That performer may choose to engage with any one male member of her audience at a time. The males in the audience cannot see each other's public aliases, as in a chat room. But the female may see the full set of public aliases in the audience. For example, males Al and Bob see advertisements or reviews for a particular performer, âkBounceâ. Both Al and Bob, who don't know each other, type âkBounceâ into their respective chat clients to add the âkBounceâ public alias to their buddy lists. The performer logs in and pairs her device. Because the performer is listed in his buddy lists, Bob sees âkBounceâ status as ready. Bob, the first audience member, clicks on âkBounceâ to start a session. His device is coupled over the network with the performer's device. Al, Chris, and other audience members also join. Within Chris's chat session window, âkBounceâ is listed under his public alias. So is â5 othersâ. He sees by an icon that he has a slave device that plays what the perform broadcasts, but from that icon he knows that his device is not coupled back to her device. The performer elects to move the token in a random order through her audience list. Chris is ultimately selected, and the token moves to him. When he sees his icon illuminate to mean that he is the sole audience member coupled round-trip with the performer, he alters his input to try to please the performer.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0140">As shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, a performer with a device can thus broadcast his or her sensor readings to multiple remote observers with their devices, all in one chat room. Observers may be watching, listening, text-typing, and most importantly, engaging with their respective devices as those devices receive and play the sensor signals from the one performer's device. In the spirit of teleoperation, Device A's actuators can react to sensors signals from at least one of the other Device B or Device C. However, to avoid Device A's actuators playing a hodge-podge of noise conglomerating signals from the multiple attached devices, options for coupling Device A's actuators to reality are: (1) the performer using Device A elects not to have a partner while broadcasting, so Device A's actuators do not actuate (or perhaps they actuate per a recording); (2) the performer on Device A actively chooses among the connected devices, here Device B or Device C, is her partner. <figref>FIG. 14</figref> shows the case where the performer has chosen Device B.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0141">The performer can choose that software automatically scan through all the other devices that are actively receiving Device A's broadcast, sampling each Device for 10s of seconds (or any user-specified period) then on to the next, in true group sex fashion. This is akin to a âtoken ringâ, and the token is illustrated as if to temporarily belong to Device B. A pair of performers use Devices A and B, with corresponding male or female Devices C receive the signal generated. If the performer selects a single member of the broadcast recipient to be the active âpartnerâ, that unique broadcast recipient device can be made aware it's âgot the micâ by a blinking light on its device or at the KarmaChat client UI. The active partner can choose whether to share audio or video back to the performer at the same time. In some embodiments, broadcast recipients may be able to communicate among each other much like in a chat room, if they concede to give up their privacy.)</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0142">Another exemplary use case is a play back recorded archive use case. This use case represents the scenario, for example, in which an unmarried man subscribes to a performer's recorded performance. Upon adding âkBounceâ to his buddy list, Don sees that this performer is not online. But she is one of his favorite performers so he opens a window to choose one performance from her history of recorded performances. His icon illuminates as if he's in the audience but not coupled to the performer. The session continues as in the previous example.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0143">Referring to <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, the transmitted sensed information can be either physical signals communicated between coupled devices on a network can be sexual effectiveness signals, which are used to evaluate a time history of physical signals with respect to its user, as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0144">One embodiment for connecting the devices <b>100</b>, <b>400</b> to the host uses Bluetooth for its configuration simplicity; its simple pairing scheme would be advantageously familiar to anyone who's used a Bluetooth earpiece. Bluetooth is cost-compatible, with suitable bandwidth and range (depends on device class we pick, and a function of power consumption). In another embodiment, 802.11 (WiFi) can be used. Other connections include through ZigBee, proprietary RF, IR, visible light, audible tones, ultra- or infra-sonic signals, etc. Alternatively, wired solutions may be employed: serial, USB, Ethernet, FireWire, Thunderbolt, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0145">The purpose of the network is to enable teleoperation between two or more devices <b>100</b>, <b>400</b> (or, one operating alone as it plays back a recorded session). Referring to <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, there are several components that ensure sexual telepresence, including multiple devices <b>100</b>, <b>400</b> (here called karma devices), Bluetooth connections for each, a computer/telephone/connection device, Wi-Fi or the Ethernet, a router, the internet, and ultimately the host server. Note that while all of the identified devices are online at the same time, they are not necessarily partnered with each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0146">In summary, a user may have in his/her home one or more sex toys, which he/she may connect to any host e.g. PC, laptop, smart phone, or tablet. The host runs KarmaNet proprietary software âchat clientâ (described below). This chat client knows how to pair with a Karma device over Bluetooth, and it knows how to connect to the KarmaNet servers over WiFi and Internet. In this way, the chat client is the bridge between a Karma sex toy device and the server. Teleoperation data, such as sensor signals, can then be relayed in real-time between two or more devices via two or more of these bridges. The partner device receives sensor signals and responds by affecting its actuators. Its actuators stimulate the user's anatomy, and the partner user's anatomy responds. That response, in turn, is sensed and fed over the same mechanism back to the first device. In this way the teleoperation loop is closed. Text chat, video, and/or audio may also be shared in addition to the teleoperation signals, just as in a regular chat scenario. In an alternate embodiment, the server may be cut out of the loop for efficiency, done by allowing chat clients to negotiate a direct peer-to-peer connection.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0147">Typical loop closure rates of the teleoperation loop can be in the Ë10 Hz range in production, though latency is as important as rate closure in determining stability. It is possible to detect latency and dynamically slow or speed up the loop closure rate. It may also be important to retain a recently buffered signal if the connection drops; the buffered signal will play as a loop until the connection is re-established (in sync with the loop signal), or the recently buffered signal will slowly fade away if the connection isn't restarted after several (Ë5) seconds.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0148">For signals transferred between devices, one embodiment includes isochronous communication protocols. Streaming audio and video are examples of data that is isochronous, data that is refreshed regularly and is better to keep on playing even if a packet is lost (transient glitch). File exchange is a counter example, where all the packets must come across perfectly. If the option is available, it may be wise to use UDP instead of the more familiar TCP. UDP does not guarantee the arrival of signals. The protocol described herein can tolerate lost signals the same way real-time audio or video stream can (up to a point, then the device output fades to âoffâ to avoid confusion on user's part, or to avoid instability). UDP is preferential because of its more âisochronousâ natureËlower latency, lower packet overheadËversus the more common TCP/IP standard. But, we are not constrained to use UDP.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0149">In order to connect a device to the chat client, the chat client needs to be able to see the devices that are out there (once they are paired to the local host, the same way you pair a Bluetooth headset). Zero configuration networking solutions, like Bonjour, are typically used to advertise a device's services. Bonjour could be implemented in the sex toy firmware to allow the paired sex toy device to advertise its service, likely a UDP port. As a reference, there are online examples for how to run Bonjour on Arduino. When the sex toy uses Bonjour to advertise itself, the chat client may discover the sex toy and identify it as a Karma sex toy. The chat client would then check for the unique ID and pass it on to the server, where that unique ID may be required to negotiate/complete the connection. This way, the unique ID is used to maintain quality and protect the revenue stream by keeping Karma devices from being copied with knock-offs (note the unique ID should be encrypted in the sex toy device's flash, but the server can also do clever things to ensure that the same ID is used by the same user login).</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0150">Separately, the chat client must connect securely to the KarmaNet servers. It is common for a chat solution to leverage the XMPP standard (formerly Jabber). Google Talk is an example of an XMPP compatible client, and there are hundreds of other examples that run on all different OSs. Google Talk, for instance, provides voice, video, text, and file sharing capabilities among chat buddies. We anticipate that our chat client would be XMPP compatible, and would be implemented in a way that instances of the Karma chat client would talk only to the proprietary KarmaNet servers. Of course, our chat client would provide the additional capability to communicate physical signals and sexual effectiveness signals over UDP as provided by an appropriate XMPP extension, such as XEP-0166.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0151">Another advantage to using the XMPP protocol is that several XMPP server codebases are readily available. The intention is that the KarmaNet servers run one of these XMPP servers, so the chat clients have something to talk to. Chat clients will be configured to look for Karma's XMPP servers, and only Karma's (as opposed to, say, Google's XMPP servers to which Google Talk clients speak).</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0152">The server can be responsible for working like a switchboard to connect the real-time sessions between, potentially, thousands of simultaneous users. Server features, perhaps distributed across multiple machines in the cloud, may include: (1) XMPP server which allows buddies to find and connect, as well as to search and add via public alias; (2) some implementation of the right XMPP extension to exchange real-time teledildonics traffic; (3) recording and playback engines, which build on the above XMPP component and have their own database; (4) database to track user data, including login and password, billing info, usage metrics, public alias, user association with a device unique ID, etc.; (5) usage engine, tracking usage and entering into database; (6) billing engine, to pull from database and bill users. Front end may be required, depending on ultimate business model; (7) mapping engine, to negotiate and push maps to KarmaChat software; and/or (8) analysis engine, to track usage metrics, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0153">Physical signals may be transmitted over the network in a few different ways including parametrically, such as position as function of time or individually, sensor by sensor.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0154">The sensor-by-sensor is the more pure teleoperation scenario. The parametric technique is more bandwidth efficient and more likely to give stable, persistent performance through dropouts. Firmware would be responsible for fitting data to a function, such as a cyclical function like sine. Then, firmware would interpolate between updates as new parameters A and phi come in while t advances, such as in p=A*sin(t+phi). Depending on its location within the sex toy, each actuator would respond according to this function but with a different phase (add to phi).</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0155">One challenge with tele-operated devices is that they can be driven unstable when actuators and sensors are collocated. Consider the scenario in which one sex toy device senses it is being squeezed. It sends this physical signal across the network to the partner device. The partner device's corresponding actuator responds by contracting in order to match the sensed squeeze. Now, there is a sensor mounted to the partner device's actuator. When the actuator squeezes, the partner device sends a squeeze signal back to the original device. The original device squeeze more, in response, or less depending on the mechanical time constant and connection latencies. The result is what looks like noise, possibly with positive feedback heading toward instability.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0156">Referring to <figref>FIG. 16</figref>, one solution to this undesirable scenario is to offer a mapping between physical sensors on the two devices, so that a sensor in an actuator/sensor pair does not stimulate the mirrored actuator on the partner device. The offset strategy, as illustrated in the figure below, breaks the collocation (assuming no coupled motion between, say, sensor <b>3</b> and actuator <b>5</b>). This scenario is possible because physical update between a man and a woman partner can be convincing even if not exactly in phase.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0157">It may be that Karma sex toy devices are simply not always symmetrical (i.e. different number of sensors and actuators, in different arrangements) between two coupled devices, so a mapping must be negotiated at the start of a session. The file that explains this mapping can live in firmware, as part of the chat client to implement, or on the server.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0158">It is instinctive for males to compete for sex, and perhaps to compete at sex. In some embodiments, therefore, the systems and devices described herein can be used for gaming. In a 1-to-1 scenario, and especially in the 1-to-many situation when 1 broadcast recipient is temporarily selected as the performer's partner, there is a game to be realized. Upon getting his 30 seconds of fame, a temporary partner's goal may be to manipulate his own device in attempt to optimally stimulate the performerâto âperform backâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0159">This âaudience participationâ is awarded a score by the server, score issued as a function of a) how stimulated the performer was in turn, or b) what the user generated with respect to what the performer is historically known to like. The server (discussed elsewhere) has the capability to analyze signals much the same way Pandora knows what music a person likes (but done through sensors instead of whether one presses the âthumbs up/downâ button).</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0160">Just as individuals seek compatible mates online, profiles of toy users, their preferences for interaction, movement styles, session durations or gender preferences can be used to recommend player liaisons. This match-making process yields opportunities for optimized connections among users and can be linked with profiles of third-party match-making services.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0161">Sessions may be monitored, recorded, and analyzed by a server, such as for: (1) straightforward example of recording a session with one's partner, for when he/she is not available to engage real-time; (2) recorded sessions from professional performers; (3) sexual âgreeting cardâ, a recorded session from one user that is transmitted to another for playback at the 2nd user's convenience; or (4) for analysis, such as average anatomical size across a population. Pertinent for diagnostic medical device, behavior of a particular user, such as how often engages in sex (times per week), how hard and fast are motions during sex (over both time and frequency), time from first engagement to orgasm (for medical study of premature ejaculation), instances of multiple orgasms, transfer function(s) between physical signals and sexual effectiveness signals, correlation studies between sensor signals, including the orgasm button, rating or scoring sessions for extent of stimulation achieved, crowd-sourcing optimal sessions using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, optimizing configuration of a device or multi-device mapping, feedback from biometric sensors, or from the orgasm button, measuring progress during treatment of sexual dysfunction in men or women, or providing strategic âinputsâ, perhaps learned from crowd sourcing or designed by physicians/researchers, during treatment of sexual dysfunction.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0162">In some embodiments, in order to monetize the connection, the internal firmware in each device can receive a token or cypher and then process it via another piece of online software. This can allow a service provider to charge for the connection and still allow the user to use the free audio method of connection. The token can be purchased, for example, and then a signal downloaded through the same audio connection without any more effort from the user that simply going to our separate site, and selling time. A cypher can then be uploaded into the device.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="1">Additional Embodiments</heading>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0163">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 18A-18B</figref>, an exemplary multi-segmented penetrative sex toy <b>1800</b> includes individually actuated expander mechanisms and a co-located flexible sensor capable of measuring subtle and large deformations as the device is inserted into orifices, stroked, or touched in any way. The segments are rotatably coupled by way of ball and socket features in each segment and there is an elastic element disposed between each segment to provide restoring forces to a neutralâstraightâposition. In each segment, multiple balls are acted upon by a conical plunger that is actuated in tension by a fine cable. The cable is tensioned by an SMA element controlled by a micro-controller providing PWM excitation. SMA elements are arranged in a pulley rack in the device handle. A living hinge spring beam part provides bias force to restore the SMA wires. In addition, the outer sheath also provided restoring force.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0164">Each segment is capable, under microprocessor control, of reporting an instantaneous constrictive and expansive strain signal with no limitation in bandwidth (up to hundreds of Hz) due to the instant resistive response of the sensors. The diameter of the assembly can grow, for example, from a 28 mm girth to Ë40 mm when fully actuated. Each segment can actuate to expand out and generate expansion forces. While sensors are collocated with actuators, it is possible for the local position control of one actuator to be responsive to the strain measured on an adjacent sensor. This may be advantageous for control stability reasons when trying to replicate the forces on a tele-operated networked device it is paired to. In this case the Nth actuator may be controlled by the error signal of the paired device's Nth sensor, but be locally controlled by an error signal to an adjacent sensor.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0165">In some embodiments, there are cables that attach to the conical drive plungers, they attach to beams with living hinges in the actuator housing. Those beams attach to SMA wire that makes two wraps around 15 mm pulleys. This SMA can be, for example, a 0.008 diameter wire with 11.6 ohm impedance.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0166">All the SMA can live in a compartment that has forced air cooling. There can be a chamber between the pulley section and the segments for batteries, etc. There can be a cover over the handle end.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0167">There can be five separate independent cable/SMA circuits where each conical drive plunger is independently actuated. Each plunger has two compression springs that bias it in its respective bore. This keeps the balls pressed out to approximately half of the actuator stroke. The reason for this is to create a nominal stretch on the sensor and have some range of compression for sensing. When the balls are driven out of the bores in the segments, they press out and stretch the sensor assemblies. The sensor can be, for example, a lamination of 0.010 inch thick silicone and the special semi-conductive material. The resistance drops as the balls strain out and increases as they are pressed into the bores.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0168">The restoring force for the SMA wires comes from the combination of the bias springs that keep the balls in a half out state and the stiffness of the living hinge beams in the actuator housing. Ultimately, forces put on the balls by the user will recover the SMA. There is no provision for a sensor to sense when the 400 mm of SMA wire has contracted to the full 8 mm required to move the plunger all the way.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0169">The actuator housing and the beams with living hinges are where wire strain can be sensed. This can be as simple as a contact that is made between any beam and a common electrode. Firmware can ensure that the devices doesn't exceed 2% strain and/or overheat the wire.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0170">In one embodiment, the actuators will expand the outer girth from 29 to 39 mm with about one pound of total radial force divided by five balls on each segment. The rubber sensor ring will tend to spread out force and strain so individual balls will not be felt through the sheath (although that may be interesting).</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0171">Each conical drive plunger can be perforated with holes permitting the passage of upstream tension cables and wires from the sensors. Each segment can be rotatable with respect to its adjacent segments and there is a low durometer o-ring between each segment to provide restoring force. The actuator common ground is at the terminal block in between the pulleys. Each flexure beam has a separate wire that goes to the Mosfets. Thus, for the actuators, there are six wires that need to carry up to an amp. Each sensor assembly has two fine electrodes coming from it. They will live under the sheath and do not enter the mechanical assembly. There is a provision in the tip part for an ERM for vibe. The very proximal end of the device incorporates a quiet, compact, fan. This would draw air past the SMA spools.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0172">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 19A-19D</figref>, an actuator <b>1900</b> can be configured to be incorporated into a male masturbator device <b>1901</b>. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 19C-19D</figref>, series of these actuators <b>1900</b> can be arranged in a larger assembly such that they all act independently on a soft elastomeric vaginal canal insert. A penis inserted into the sleeve will sense a range of subtle to forceful contractions of the canal by effect of a cable that circumscribes the canal's outer surface with three tangent contact arcs. As the cable is tensioned by SMA actuators (or alternative actuators), the sleeve is compressed against the tissue of the penis. Alternate actuators could be DC motors with cable winding capstans or gear train drive. Additionally, solenoids, or electromagnetic variable reluctance actuators could be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0173">The tension cable, is terminated to the plastic section part and winds around three pulleys before turning on a fourth pulley where the cable then runs parallel to the cylindrical axis of the toy. Just after this pulley, the cable is crimped or otherwise joined to a length of SMA wire. At the distal end of the toy (away from the simulated vaginal or anal opening), there is another pulley on a translatable ring that is concentric to the axis of the canal. The SMA wire wraps around this translating pulley and returns to a fixed termination on the same plastic section or a neighboring plastic section. Electrical connections to the SMA wire are made at these terminations and the crimp between the SMA and the cable.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0174">As the SMA contracts, the tension on the three sections of cable between the pulleys applies compressive forces to the elastomer insert resulting in its contraction around the penis. Each actuator segment is independently controlled by a microprocessor.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0175">The translating ring is adjusted by an external knob on a thread (not shown) or some other means to adjust the effective preload on the cable system. This way, the vaginal opening diameter, tightness, is adjustable and the effective constriction on the penis is variable. It is important to note that the SMA will provide the same 2-3% contraction on the cable system regardless of the pretension by movement of the sliding ring, therefore a wide range of penis girth will be accommodated by the device and the relative intensity can be adjusted with this one simple mechanical control prior and during play.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0176">The soft elastomeric sheath may incorporate one or more sensors. One or more soft elastomeric semi-conducting sensors as described in this document may be attached to the silicone sheath's outer surface or otherwise embedded into is as molded to provide a varying electrical signal in response to the motion of a penis inside the canal.</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0177">Either a series of sensor bands or a single strip with multiple electrodes would likely be attached or molded into the sheath. Ideally, each segment of the actuator would have a corresponding strain sensor.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0178">Thus, in the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 19A-19D</figref>, all cables are tensioned by a single control knob that sets the slack in the system and applies an adjustable preload. There may be a series extension spring in the cable path as well as a spring to keep the SMA on the pulley under all conditions. The latter spring would be of negligible impact on constriction force while the former would need to be stiff to allow transmission of SMA contractile forces. Cable and pulley subassemblies are compact and are capable of fitting in the empty space between the synthetic flesh sheath and the outer shell of commercial masturbator sleeves. Use of one or more flexible sensors on or molded into the soft fleshy sheath internal to the actuator assembly. Independent control of constriction cable pre-tension allows the user to adjust bias force (the constant amount of constriction) without changing the force or the displacement of the SMA actuation. Therefore, a range of penis size will experience the same sensations regardless of girth. This not only equalizes pleasure for the user, but also enables the tele-present participant to enjoy a larger signal from a tighter fit. This in combination with user adjustable control of the SMA âvolumeâ or output power, will allow a very wide dynamic range of sensitivity. To provide variable preconstruction of the canal (or for expanding the girth of a phallic device), one or more fluid passages can connect reservoir with a check valve and pump region to distally located inflatable regions molded into the soft tissue. By pumping the pump, the passages pressurize the chambers with fluid or air casing internal or external swelling. A release valve would provide release of pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0179">In some embodiments, a constricting actuator can include a plastic arc with helical grooves machined in it before the slot is cut. Two screw terminations can provide anchoring and connection to SMA wire which is wrapped in such a way that it crosses over the gap in the ring. When current is passed through the SMA, the ring contracts forcefully changing its inside diameter noticeably. Inserting a finger into this 25 mm ID, one feels large forces in response to a changing electrical signal. PTFE tubing can be used to minimize the friction of the wire on the groove. This increases recovery time between actuation pulses, but also increases mechanical efficiency. Several wraps can be used to achieve a long life with a sizeable elongation at only 2% contraction.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0180">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 20A-20C</figref>, an actuator device <b>2000</b> can operate within the âjust noticeable differenceâ (JND), i.e., the minimum distance between two stimulators interacting with skin on various parts of the body having different sensitivies, or the differential strain on tissue between two stimulators, of genital tissue. The actuator device can include at least 16 independent realistic contraction/expansion actuators with the same number of independent force/displacement sensors.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0181">In order to achieve long actuator life (&lt;500,000) cycles, the materials for the actuator device can be operated at &lt;2% strain. In order to have an array of say, 16 actuators along and around a 180 mm long phallus device or inside a 180 mm deep vaginal canal device, the device can include approximately 200 mm of wire for each actuator.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0182">Further, real genital internal displacements and contractions are on the order of 0-15 mm during intercourse or orgasm. Just the natural compliance of tissue is in this range and in order to sense position and provide actuator force over this range, the actuators in the actuator device can each comply over such a distance while sensing their position and being able to exert forces under command of the remote device.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0183">A 1% strain on a 180 mm SMA wire will produce 1.8 mm of contraction. This is at least â of the requirement. We need some mechanism that not only packages the wire efficiently, but at the same time amplifies the displacement to approach 10 mm. With such amplification, a nominal 30 mm diameter phallic toy could expand any of its <b>16</b> actuators to increase diameter realistically or raise several in a row in response to real stroking at the other end of the tele-robotic link. Conversely, a vaginal toy could contract from 30 mm to 20 in diameter with very realistic force levels during orgasm. Keep in mind that all of these actuator-sensor pairs are independent and transducing what they feel while at the same time exerting what the other coupled device senses in real time.</p>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0184">For purposes of simplicity, <figref>FIGS. 20A-20C</figref> show only the female version (i.e., mimicking female anatomy) of this concept. The male version would be similar, but inverted mechanically.</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0185">The central element of the design is a battery housing tube that provides a semirigid housing for three NiMh battery cells. Five segments are located on the housing and aligned by an anti-rotation feature molded into the housing.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0186">Each segment has four (and could have more) separate living hinge cantilever beam elements. There can be approximately 20 mm distance from the end of the beam to the body of the segment.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0187">The first problem the segment design solves is displacement. Each beam element can be deflected approximately 10 mm from its resting state or compressed 3 mm inward. The bottom of the beam is at least 3 mm below the outer diameter of the segment (which is 28 mm, a practical diameter considering over molding silicone and comfortable insertion for anal sex). In some embodiments, this 3 mm difference is critical. There is a triangle formed between the top of the segment and the end of the beam. If we span this distance with a length of SMA, and contract it by 1.8 mm, our beam will forcefully move 10 mm. This actuator beam geometry effectively amplifies displacement.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0188">The next problem the segment design solves is how to house 180 mm lengths of SMA wire. We have four elements to actuate and house independently. They must be mechanically terminated and insulated electrically. There seemed no practical way to simply extend the wires past the beams as this would result in a very long toy (at least 180 mm longer than we want) and rigid elements would need to be reacting each wires tension. This would be a packaging mess.</p>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0189">A volume efficient innovation is to wind the wire in a helix around the outer diameter of the segment. A helical groove provides a nest for the wire. Further, four separate thread starts can house four wires in the same length as one.</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0190">Each wire is terminated at the end of its cantilever beam and at the proximal end of the segment. Conventional stranded conductors carry electrical signals to the SMA wires. The problem with this helical configuration is that the wires are operating on a capstan effectively. This means that the friction forces opposing the wires contraction are exponentially increasing with the angle of wrap. We are making almost two turns of wrap and this would significantly reduce the available force. Another innovation is to sheath each wire in PTFE tubing in each helical groove. This reduces the operating friction to a negligible level. While such a sleeve will reduce heat transfer and slow down the rate of contraction, we expect that a real transduction system only needs 10 Hz of bandwidth and thermally conductive fluid like deionized H20 could be used to boost bandwidth if required.</p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0191">In some embodiments, a cylindrical sensor band (similar to the sensors described above) is wrapped around each of the segments. Each beam must deform the band in order to expand or contract. Each beam has several electrode wires that make contact with the band. The band is a compliant structure comprised of two layers: a thin silicone rubber sheet on the outside and a layer of electrically semi-conductive elastomer material on the inside. Any displacement of the beams will change the resistance between one electrode on one beam and another on the moving beam. Each beam has a unique set of electrode pairs that âreadâ the resistance of the portion of the single elastomer band in real time an convey that information to the A/D converter on the embedded microcontroller chip. This innovative sensor is elegant in that it is simply one band or a special lamination in contact with eight wires. Those wires could be reduced to printed conductive ink on the segment part. The sensor array is robust, simple, very low cost, good resolution, and highly volume efficient. The 16 sensors merely occupy the already available volume above the cantilever sections of the segments. This innovation offers very high levels of design synergy and is absolutely key to realizing a practical low cost real world haptic device.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0192">In some embodiments, the micro-controller to apply auto-scaling to the sensor data allows one lover to provide signals and the other lover to scale the sensations at the other end. Genital âfitâ becomes a variable one can control in this haptic sex toy world thanks to the application of a biomimetic sensor array and intelligent embedded software.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0193">The actuators, sensors, and other features described with respect to <figref>FIGS. 20A-20C</figref> can be used for sex toys, male and female. They can also be used as part of a simple touch surface allowing two hands to communicate.</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0194">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 21A-21B</figref>, a massage device <b>2100</b> includes a handle portion and a distal portion, distal portion incorporating one or more moveable massage elements. The total volume, girth, and dimensions of the device can be chosen such that the assembly can be comfortably inserted into a human females vaginal canal for stimulation of internal structures, i.e. G spot, or for insertion into anal canal and/or for insertion in human male anal canal for prostate stimulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0195">The massage elements can be substantially constrained to a 2 dimensional or 3-dimensional path. The massage elements can move relative to both handle and distal portion. The massage elements' motion can be defined by mechanism in distal portion, or handle portion, or combination of distal and handle portion. The massage element scan be capable of transmitting or generating vibratactile stimulation while in motion along said path. The massage elements can move under an elastic membrane. The massage elements can exert substantial forces against body surfaces while in motion. The massage elements can be manually controlled by an rotatable or translatable mechanism in the handle portion or by electromechanical assembly in handle portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0196">The handle portion and distal portion may be coupled by flexible cable containing force transmissive elements and or electronic transmission elements, i.e., the handle portion is a remote control allowing distal portion to be inserted in body while handle portion is manipulated by oneself or a partner.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0197">The massage elements' positions can be controlled by tension cables. A cable can pull each massage element against a spring located in distal portion. The cables can be disposed on opposing sides of a massage element, allowing pull-pull forces. The cables can be arranged in a pull-pull configuration connected to a rotatable capstan. The capstan can be responsive to electromagnetic actuator torque of force. The capstan can be responsive to self-contained servo actuator with internal position control, thus capstan rotation angle and resultant massage element(s) position are determined by open loop control signal provide to servo actuator. The capstan can be driven by motor and gear train without internal position sensor for servo actuation angle. The capstan drive mechanism can be combined with a sensor in the distal end responsive to position of massage element(s).</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0198">The sensor information can be used to close the loop on massage element(s) position relative to distal and or handle end. Each massage element's position can be controlled by user input, i.e. pressure sensing resistor or capacitive sensor incorporated into handle portion. The position control can be comprised of an electronic position control circuit active in maintaining the position of the massage element(s) relative to the input control signal from the position sensor responsive to the user input. The sensor control scheme can include employing a sensor connected to a microcontroller actively servo controlling position of massage element(s) in response to one or more position sensors.</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0199">The massage element(s) can be controlled in 2-D or 3-D path control. Tension cables can be arranged on linear actuator such that one cable is tensioned and translated relative to distal and or handle end while opposing cable experiences opposite translation, thus total cable length is substantially constant.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0200">The distal portion and handle portion of device can share a rotatable joint as an adjustment. The distal portion and handle portion of device can share a translation degree of freedom as an adjustment.</p>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0201">The distal portion of massage element can have one or more features intended to permit one section of the distal portion to be deformed and or displaced with respect to the other portion, which may be achieved with one or more cuts or areas with removal of material. The bisected distal portion can include a degree of intentional freedom of motion in one or more preferred directions in combination with an electromechanical actuator responsive to electrical signals intended to displace degree of freedom in response to electrical signal.</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0202">A DC motor can be used to turn torque into a force between two or more sections of bisected distal end portion. A cam can act in a slot incorporated into one section of the distal portion where the motor is substantially attached to the other section of the distal portion, torque from DC motor creating a resulting force between slot and motor body, thus forcing bisected sections of distal portion in one or more directions or both. The DC motor or other electromechanical actuator, i.e. solenoid, constant force solenoid, voice coil, etc, can be driven by an amplifier circuit to provide single ended or bipolar electrical excitation of the actuator, thus providing transduction of any range of DC to AC signals to the mechanical assembly. The amplifier and motor arrangement can be responsive to the superposition of DC and AC waveforms.</p>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0203">A moving massage element can include a magnetic material, i.e. high energy product magnetic material, and distal portion contains a coil of wire, magnetic material being forcefully responsive to magnetic field induced by coil excited by electronic circuit.</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0204">Tension on drive cables or reflected forces on drive mechanism can be sensed and given to electronic circuit or microcontroller, thus a representation of what the massage element is resisting can be conveyed to another device.</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0205">There can be a touch sensitive pad for the user to control the position of the massage ball. Further, the distal end incorporates a hinge/beam design allowing a DC motor with an eccentric arm to drive one half of the distal end relative to the other in a swelling and contracting motion with frequency response from DC to several hundred Hz. This actuator is both kinesthetic and vibratactile in nature.</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0206">Use of a worm gear on a rotating shaft where the worm advances and retracts the linear position of a carrier portion, which is threaded to receive the worm as a nut with female threads, and simultaneously the carrier portion provides a rotatable bearing for a finger portion that rides along with the carrier and has its own mating teeth that engage the worm gear. Functionally, as the worm is rotated, the finger portion rotates through a 180 degree arc as it also translates back and forth. This would be ideal for a very high force G or P spot massager. It may or may not be back-drivable.</p>
      <p id="p-00203-en" num="0207">An alternate concept for the distal end of this massager concept of <figref>FIGS. 21A-21B</figref> involves a 2-DOF gimbaled cable drive where the massager is driven by either servos or by the user manually via a proximal input surface. In the passive case, the massage tip is cable driven and connected to a 2-DOF input gimbal with a mechanical advantage.</p>
      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0208">Thus, a massage device as described herein can be configured to be inserted into vagina or anus. The device can include a distal (shaft) and handle portion.

The device can include a plurality of segments that move relative to each other and are not constrained by the handle portion. The segment can move in a peristaltic fashion such that the device selectively contracts and expands portions in order to aide in insertion or even insert on its own. The segments can move in a random fashion relative to each other or the handle portion. The segments can move in a pre-determined sequence. The segments can be controlled by actuators located in the distal portion. The segments can be controlled by one or more actuators located in handle portion. The segments can be actuated by cables in a pull-pull arrangement. The segments can be actuated by cables acting against springs. The segments can be actuated by screw thread actuators intended to convert rotation into translation, i.e., ACME thread drive, where a single DC motor rotates single drive shaft. Switches or sensors in combination with an electronic circuit can alternate the motor's rotation direction to produce oscillating mechanical motion where segments move in a rhythmic pattern. The magnitude of rotation of motor and speed of rotation can be controllable by user. A plurality of segments can be arranged on a single drive shaft rotatably attached to a plurality of screw elements where each segment has a female thread and the shaft rotates all screw elements at once. Screw elements can be a combination of left-hand and right-hand threads such that rotation of the drive shaft in one direction produces opposing motion for segments with opposite thread hands. Screw direction may be alternated or an arbitrary arrangement. A segment can include an outer ring joined to a coaxial threaded element by an island of material. The shaft portion of the distal end can incorporate an open channel thus allowing passage of a plurality of segments. Segments being supported or aligned by interaction between annular groove in segment and shaft. Segments can incorporate individual strain sensing elements such that the circumferential pressure or deformation of a segment with deformable structure may be individually measured and processed by a microcontroller or other electronic circuit. The shaft portion can incorporate an accelerometer providing one or more axis acceleration information to microcontroller or electronic circuit.

A single drive motor and electronics can be configured to alternate the rotation to create spreading and contracting segments. One motor can drive RH and LH threaded ACME thread sections that are alternately arranged to produce opposite motion for one input rotation.</p>

A single molded polypropylene part has built in living hinges permitting the distal end to be folded forcefully with a mechanical advantage in response to moving a proximal portion of the device. G and P spot massage would be enabled with this device. A single tension cable connects the movable distal portion and the proximal handle.
