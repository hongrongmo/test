      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Insect pests are a serious problem in agriculture. They destroy millions of acres of staple crops such as corn, soybeans, peas, and cotton. Yearly, these pests cause over $100 billion dollars in crop damage in the U.S. alone. In an ongoing seasonal battle, farmers must apply billions of gallons of synthetic pesticides to combat these pests. Other methods employed in the past delivered insecticidal activity by microorganisms or genes derived from microorganisms expressed in transgenic plants. For example, certain species of microorganisms of the genus <i>Bacillus </i>are known to possess pesticidal activity against a broad range of insect pests including <i>Lepidoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera</i>, and others. In fact, microbial pesticides, particularly those obtained from <i>Bacillus </i>strains, have played an important role in agriculture as alternatives to chemical pest control. Agricultural scientists have developed crop plants with enhanced insect resistance by genetically engineering crop plants to produce insecticidal proteins from <i>Bacillus</i>. For example, corn and cotton plants genetically engineered to produce Cry toxins (see, e.g., Aronson (2002) <i>Cell Mol. Life Sci. </i>59(3):417-425; Schnepf et al. (1998) <i>Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. </i>62(3):775-806) are now widely used in American agriculture and have provided the farmer with an alternative to traditional insect-control methods. However, these Bt insecticidal proteins only protect plants from a relatively narrow range of pests. Moreover, these modes of insecticidal activity provided varying levels of specificity and, in some cases, caused significant environmental consequences. Thus, there is an immediate need for alternative methods to control pests.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Methods and compositions are provided which employ a silencing element that, when ingested by a pest, such as Coleopteran plant pest including a <i>Diabrotica </i>plant pest, is capable of decreasing the expression of a target sequence in the pest. In specific embodiments, the decrease in expression of the target sequence controls the pest and thereby the methods and compositions are capable of limiting damage to a plant.

      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The present inventions now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the inventions are shown. Indeed, these inventions may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Many modifications and other embodiments of the inventions set forth herein will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which these inventions pertain having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the inventions are not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">I. Overview</heading>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Frequently, RNAi discovery methods rely on evaluation of known classes of sensitive genes (transcription factors, housekeeping genes etc.). In contrast, the target polynucleotides set forth herein were identified based solely on high throughput screens of all singletons and representatives of all gene clusters from a cDNA library of neonate and/or 3<sup>rd </sup>instar midgut western corn rootworms. This screen allowed for the discovery of many novel sequences, many of which have extremely low or no homology to known sequences. This method provided the advantage of having no built in bias to genes that are frequently highly conserved across taxa. As a result, many novel targets for RNAi as well as known genes not previously shown to be sensitive to RNAi have been identified.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">As such, methods and compositions are provided which employ one or more silencing elements that, when ingested by a pest, such as a Coleopteran plant pest or a <i>Diabrotica </i>plant pest, is capable of decreasing the expression of a target sequence in the pest. In specific embodiments, the decrease in expression of the target sequence controls the pest and thereby the methods and compositions are capable of limiting damage to a plant or plant part.

Silencing elements comprising sequences, complementary sequences, active fragments or variants of these target polynucleotides are provided which, when ingested by or when contacting the pest, decrease the expression of one or more of the target sequences and thereby controls the pest (i.e., has insecticidal activity).</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">As used herein, by âcontrolling a pestâ or âcontrols a pestâ is intended any affect on a pest that results in limiting the damage that the pest causes. Controlling a pest includes, but is not limited to, killing the pest, inhibiting development of the pest, altering fertility or growth of the pest in such a manner that the pest provides less damage to the plant, decreasing the number of offspring produced, producing less fit pests, producing pests more susceptible to predator attack, or deterring the pests from eating the plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Reducing the level of expression of the target polynucleotide or the polypeptide encoded thereby, in the pest results in the suppression, control, and/or killing the invading pest. Reducing the level of expression of the target sequence of the pest will reduce the pest damage by at least about 2% to at least about 6%, at least about 5% to about 50%, at least about 10% to about 60%, at least about 30% to about 70%, at least about 40% to about 80%, or at least about 50% to about 90% or greater. Hence, the methods of the invention can be utilized to control pests, particularly, Coleopteran plant pests or a <i>Diabrotica </i>plant pest.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Assays measuring the control of a pest are commonly known in the art, as are methods to record nodal injury score. See, for example, Oleson et al. (2005) J. Econ. Entomol. 98:1-8. See, for example, the examples below.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The invention is drawn to compositions and methods for protecting plants from a plant pest, such as Coleopteran plant pests or <i>Diabrotica </i>plant pests or inducing resistance in a plant to a plant pest, such as Coleopteran plant pests or <i>Diabrotica </i>plant pests. As used herein âColeopteran plant pestâ is used to refer to any member of the Coleoptera order.

      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">As used herein, a âtarget sequenceâ or âtarget polynucleotideâ comprises any sequence in the pest that one desires to reduce the level of expression thereof. In specific embodiments, decreasing the level of the target sequence in the pest controls the pest. For instance, the target sequence may be essential for growth and development. While the target sequence can be expressed in any tissue of the pest, in specific embodiments, the sequences targeted for suppression in the pest are expressed in cells of the gut tissue of the pest, cells in the midgut of the pest, and cells lining the gut lumen or the midgut. Such target sequences can be involved in, for example, gut cell metabolism, growth or differentiation. Non-limiting examples of target sequences of the invention include a polynucleotide set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20, 21, 24, 25, 28, 29, 32, 33, 36, 37, 40, 41, 44, 45, 48, 49, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 60, 61, 64, 65, 68, 69, 72, 73, 76, 77, 80, 81, 84, 85, 88, 89, 92, 93, 96, 97, 100, 101, 104, 105, 108, 109, 112, 113, 116, 117, 120, 121, 124, 125, 128, 129, 132, 133, 136, 137, 140, 141, 144, 145, 148, 149, 152, 153, 156, 157, 160, 161, 164, 165, 168, 169, 172, 173, 176, 177, 180, 181, 184, 185, 188, 189, 192, 193, 196, 197, 200, 201, 204, 205, 208, 209, 212, 213, 216, 217, 220, 221, 224, 225, 228, 229, 232, 233, 236, 237, 240, 241, 244, 245, 248, 249, 252, 253, 256, 257, 260, 261, 264, 265, 268, 269, 272, 273, 276, 277, 280, 281, 284, 285, 288, 289, 292, 293, 296, 297, 300, 301, 304, 305, 308, 309, 312, 313, 316, 317, 320, 321, 324, 325, 328, 329, 332, 333, 336, 337, 340, 341, 344, 345, 348, 349, 352, 353, 356, 357, 360, 361, 364, 365, 368, 369, 372, 373, 376, 377, 380, 381, 384, 385, 388, 389, 392, 393, 396, 397, 400, 401, 404, 405, 408, 409, 412, 413, 416, 417, 420, 421, 424, 425, 428, 429, 432, 433, 436, 437, 440, 441, 444, 445, 448, 449, 452, 453, 456, 457, 460, 461, 464, 465, 468, 469, 472, 473, 476, 477, 480, 481, 484, 485, 488, 489, 492, 493, 496, 497, 500, 501, 504, 505, 508, 509, 512, 513, 516, 517, 520, 521, 524, 525, 528, 529, 532, 533, 536, 537, 540, 541, 544, 545, 548, 549, 552, 553, 556, 557, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 576, 577, 578, 579, 580, 581, 582, 583, 584, 585, 586, 587, 588, 589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594, 595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 600, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, 616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 621, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627, 628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670, 671, 672, 673, 674, 675, 676, 677, 678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688, 689, 690, 691, 692, 693, 694, 695, 696, 697, 700, 701, 702, 703, 706, 707, 708, 709, 712, 713, 714, 715, 718, 719, 720, 721, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728, or active variants and fragments thereof, and complements thereof, including, for example, SEQ ID NOS: 1, 9, 37, 45, 49, 61, 65, 77, 101, 113, 137, 141, 145, 149, 153, 157, 169, 173, 181, 185, 189, 205, 217, 225, 233, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 576, 577, 578, 579, 580, 581, 582, 583, 584, 585, 586, 587, 588, 589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594, 595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 600, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, 616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 621, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627, 628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670, 671, 672, 673, 674, 675, 676, 677, 678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688, 689, 690, 691, 692, and active variants and fragments thereof, and complements thereof, and SEQ ID NOS: 4, 140, 144, 148, 693, 694, 695, 696, 697, 700, 701, 702, 703, 706, 707, 708, 709, 712, 713, 714, 715, 718, 719, 720, 721, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728, and active variants and fragments thereof, and complements thereof.

      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="2">III. Silencing Elements</heading>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">By âsilencing elementâ is intended a polynucleotide which when contacted by or ingested by a pest, is capable of reducing or eliminating the level or expression of a target polynucleotide or the polypeptide encoded thereby. The silencing element employed can reduce or eliminate the expression level of the target sequence by influencing the level of the target RNA transcript or, alternatively, by influencing translation and thereby affecting the level of the encoded polypeptide. Methods to assay for functional silencing elements that are capable of reducing or eliminating the level of a sequence of interest are disclosed elsewhere herein. A single polynucleotide employed in the methods of the invention can comprise one or more silencing elements to the same or different target polynucleotides. The silencing element can be produced in vivo (i.e., in a host cell such as a plant or microorganism) or in vitro.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In specific embodiments, a silencing element may comprise a chimeric construction molecule comprising two or more sequences of the present invention. For example, the chimeric construction may be a hairpin or dsRNA as disclosed herein. A chimera may comprise two or more sequences of the present invention. In one embodiment, a chimera contemplates two complementary sequences set forth herein having some degree of mismatch between the complementary sequences such that the two sequences are not perfect complements of one another. Providing at least two different sequences in a single silencing element may allow for targeting multiple genes using one silencing element and/or for example, one expression cassette. Targeting multiple genes may allow for slowing or reducing the possibility of resistance by the pest, and providing the multiple targeting ability in one expressed molecule may reduce the expression burden of the transformed plant or plant product, or provide topical treatments that are capable of targeting multiple hosts with one application.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In specific embodiments, the target sequence is not endogenous to the plant. In other embodiments, while the silencing element controls pests, preferably the silencing element has no effect on the normal plant or plant part.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">As discussed in further detail below, silencing elements can include, but are not limited to, a sense suppression element, an antisense suppression element, a double stranded RNA, a siRNA, a amiRNA, a miRNA, or a hairpin suppression element. Silencing elements of the present invention may comprise a chimera where two or more sequences of the present invention or active fragments or variants, or complements thereof, are found in the same RNA molecule. Further, a sequence of the present invention or active fragment or variant, or complement thereof, may be present as more than one copy in a DNA construct, silencing element, DNA molecule or RNA molecule. In a hairpin or dsRNA molecule, the location of a sense or antisense sequence in the molecule, for example, in which sequence is transcribed first or is located on a particular terminus of the RNA molecule, is not limiting to the invention, and the invention is not to be limited by disclosures herein of a particular location for such a sequence. Non-limiting examples of silencing elements that can be employed to decrease expression of these target Coleopteran plant pest sequences or <i>Diabrotica </i>plant pest sequences comprise fragments and variants of the sense or antisense sequence or consists of the sense or antisense sequence of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20, 21, 24, 25, 28, 29, 32, 33, 36, 37, 40, 41, 44, 45, 48, 49, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 60, 61, 64, 65, 68, 69, 72, 73, 76, 77, 80, 81, 84, 85, 88, 89, 92, 93, 96, 97, 100, 101, 104, 105, 108, 109, 112, 113, 116, 117, 120, 121, 124, 125, 128, 129, 132, 133, 136, 137, 140, 141, 144, 145, 148, 149, 152, 153, 156, 157, 160, 161, 164, 165, 168, 169, 172, 173, 176, 177, 180, 181, 184, 185, 188, 189, 192, 193, 196, 197, 200, 201, 204, 205, 208, 209, 212, 213, 216, 217, 220, 221, 224, 225, 228, 229, 232, 233, 236, 237, 240, 241, 244, 245, 248, 249, 252, 253, 256, 257, 260, 261, 264, 265, 268, 269, 272, 273, 276, 277, 280, 281, 284, 285, 288, 289, 292, 293, 296, 297, 300, 301, 304, 305, 308, 309, 312, 313, 316, 317, 320, 321, 324, 325, 328, 329, 332, 333, 336, 337, 340, 341, 344, 345, 348, 349, 352, 353, 356, 357, 360, 361, 364, 365, 368, 369, 372, 373, 376, 377, 380, 381, 384, 385, 388, 389, 392, 393, 396, 397, 400, 401, 404, 405, 408, 409, 412, 413, 416, 417, 420, 421, 424, 425, 428, 429, 432, 433, 436, 437, 440, 441, 444, 445, 448, 449, 452, 453, 456, 457, 460, 461, 464, 465, 468, 469, 472, 473, 476, 477, 480, 481, 484, 485, 488, 489, 492, 493, 496, 497, 500, 501, 504, 505, 508, 509, 512, 513, 516, 517, 520, 521, 524, 525, 528, 529, 532, 533, 536, 537, 540, 541, 544, 545, 548, 549, 552, 553, 556, 557, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 576, 577, 578, 579, 580, 581, 582, 583, 584, 585, 586, 587, 588, 589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594, 595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 600, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, 616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 621, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627, 628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670, 671, 672, 673, 674, 675, 676, 677, 678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688, 689, 690, 691, 692, 693, 694, 695, 696, 697, 700, 701, 702, 703, 706, 707, 708, 709, 712, 713, 714, 715, 718, 719, 720, 721, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728, or active variants and fragments thereof, and complements thereof, including, for example, SEQ ID NOS: 1, 9, 37, 45, 49, 61, 65, 77, 101, 113, 137, 141, 145, 149, 153, 157, 169, 173, 181, 185, 189, 205, 217, 225, 233, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 576, 577, 578, 579, 580, 581, 582, 583, 584, 585, 586, 587, 588, 589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594, 595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 600, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, 616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 621, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627, 628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670, 671, 672, 673, 674, 675, 676, 677, 678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688, 689, 690, 691, 692, and active variants and fragments thereof, and complements thereof, and SEQ ID NOS: 4, 140, 144, 148, 693, 694, 695, 696, 697, 700, 701, 702, 703, 706, 707, 708, 709, 712, 713, 714, 715, 718, 719, 720, 721, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728, and active variants and fragments thereof, and complements thereof. The silencing element can further comprise additional sequences that advantageously effect transcription and/or the stability of a resulting transcript. For example, the silencing elements can comprise at least one thymine residue at the 3â² end. This can aid in stabilization. Thus, the silencing elements can have at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more thymine residues at the 3â² end. As discussed in further detail below, enhancer suppressor elements can also be employed in conjunction with the silencing elements disclosed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">By âreducesâ or âreducingâ the expression level of a polynucleotide or a polypeptide encoded thereby is intended to mean, the polynucleotide or polypeptide level of the target sequence is statistically lower than the polynucleotide level or polypeptide level of the same target sequence in an appropriate control pest which is not exposed to (i.e., has not ingested or come into contact with) the silencing element. In particular embodiments of the invention, reducing the polynucleotide level and/or the polypeptide level of the target sequence in a pest according to the invention results in less than 95%, less than 90%, less than 80%, less than 70%, less than 60%, less than 50%, less than 40%, less than 30%, less than 20%, less than 10%, or less than 5% of the polynucleotide level, or the level of the polypeptide encoded thereby, of the same target sequence in an appropriate control pest. Methods to assay for the level of the RNA transcript, the level of the encoded polypeptide, or the activity of the polynucleotide or polypeptide are discussed elsewhere herein.</p>

      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">As used herein, a âsense suppression elementâ comprises a polynucleotide designed to express an RNA molecule corresponding to at least a part of a target messenger RNA in the âsenseâ orientation. Expression of the RNA molecule comprising the sense suppression element reduces or eliminates the level of the target polynucleotide or the polypeptide encoded thereby. The polynucleotide comprising the sense suppression element may correspond to all or part of the sequence of the target polynucleotide, all or part of the 5â² and/or 3â² untranslated region of the target polynucleotide, all or part of the coding sequence of the target polynucleotide, or all or part of both the coding sequence and the untranslated regions of the target polynucleotide.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Typically, a sense suppression element has substantial sequence identity to the target polynucleotide, typically greater than about 65% sequence identity, greater than about 85% sequence identity, about 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% sequence identity. See, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,283,184 and 5,034,323; herein incorporated by reference. The sense suppression element can be any length so long as it allows for the suppression of the targeted sequence.

      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">ii. Antisense Suppression Elements</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">As used herein, an âantisense suppression elementâ comprises a polynucleotide which is designed to express an RNA molecule complementary to all or part of a target messenger RNA. Expression of the antisense RNA suppression element reduces or eliminates the level of the target polynucleotide. The polynucleotide for use in antisense suppression may correspond to all or part of the complement of the sequence encoding the target polynucleotide, all or part of the complement of the 5â² and/or 3â² untranslated region of the target polynucleotide, all or part of the complement of the coding sequence of the target polynucleotide, or all or part of the complement of both the coding sequence and the untranslated regions of the target polynucleotide. In addition, the antisense suppression element may be fully complementary (i.e., 100% identical to the complement of the target sequence) or partially complementary (i.e., less than 100% identical to the complement of the target sequence) to the target polynucleotide. In specific embodiments, the antisense suppression element comprises at least 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence complementarity to the target polynucleotide. Antisense suppression may be used to inhibit the expression of multiple proteins in the same plant. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,942,657. Furthermore, the antisense suppression element can be complementary to a portion of the target polynucleotide. Generally, sequences of at least 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 450 nucleotides or greater of the sequence set forth in any of SEQ ID NOS: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20, 21, 24, 25, 28, 29, 32, 33, 36, 37, 40, 41, 44, 45, 48, 49, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 60, 61, 64, 65, 68, 69, 72, 73, 76, 77, 80, 81, 84, 85, 88, 89, 92, 93, 96, 97, 100, 101, 104, 105, 108, 109, 112, 113, 116, 117, 120, 121, 124, 125, 128, 129, 132, 133, 136, 137, 140, 141, 144, 145, 148, 149, 152, 153, 156, 157, 160, 161, 164, 165, 168, 169, 172, 173, 176, 177, 180, 181, 184, 185, 188, 189, 192, 193, 196, 197, 200, 201, 204, 205, 208, 209, 212, 213, 216, 217, 220, 221, 224, 225, 228, 229, 232, 233, 236, 237, 240, 241, 244, 245, 248, 249, 252, 253, 256, 257, 260, 261, 264, 265, 268, 269, 272, 273, 276, 277, 280, 281, 284, 285, 288, 289, 292, 293, 296, 297, 300, 301, 304, 305, 308, 309, 312, 313, 316, 317, 320, 321, 324, 325, 328, 329, 332, 333, 336, 337, 340, 341, 344, 345, 348, 349, 352, 353, 356, 357, 360, 361, 364, 365, 368, 369, 372, 373, 376, 377, 380, 381, 384, 385, 388, 389, 392, 393, 396, 397, 400, 401, 404, 405, 408, 409, 412, 413, 416, 417, 420, 421, 424, 425, 428, 429, 432, 433, 436, 437, 440, 441, 444, 445, 448, 449, 452, 453, 456, 457, 460, 461, 464, 465, 468, 469, 472, 473, 476, 477, 480, 481, 484, 485, 488, 489, 492, 493, 496, 497, 500, 501, 504, 505, 508, 509, 512, 513, 516, 517, 520, 521, 524, 525, 528, 529, 532, 533, 536, 537, 540, 541, 544, 545, 548, 549, 552, 553, 556, 557, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 576, 577, 578, 579, 580, 581, 582, 583, 584, 585, 586, 587, 588, 589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594, 595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 600, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, 616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 621, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627, 628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670, 671, 672, 673, 674, 675, 676, 677, 678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688, 689, 690, 691, 692, 693, 694, 695, 696, 697, 700, 701, 702, 703, 706, 707, 708, 709, 712, 713, 714, 715, 718, 719, 720, 721, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728, or active variants and fragments thereof, and complements thereof, including, for example, SEQ ID NOS: 1, 9, 37, 45, 49, 61, 65, 77, 101, 113, 137, 141, 145, 149, 153, 157, 169, 173, 181, 185, 189, 205, 217, 225, 233, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 576, 577, 578, 579, 580, 581, 582, 583, 584, 585, 586, 587, 588, 589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594, 595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 600, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, 616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 621, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627, 628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670, 671, 672, 673, 674, 675, 676, 677, 678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688, 689, 690, 691, 692, and active variants and fragments thereof, and complements thereof, and SEQ ID NOS: 4, 140, 144, 148, 693, 694, 695, 696, 697, 700, 701, 702, 703, 706, 707, 708, 709, 712, 713, 714, 715, 718, 719, 720, 721, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728, and active variants and fragments thereof, and complements thereof may be used. Methods for using antisense suppression to inhibit the expression of endogenous genes in plants are described, for example, in Liu et al (2002) <i>Plant Physiol. </i>129:1732-1743 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,759,829 and 5,942,657, each of which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">iii. Double Stranded RNA Suppression Element</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">A âdouble stranded RNA silencing elementâ or âdsRNAâ comprises at least one transcript that is capable of forming a dsRNA either before or after ingestion by a pest. Thus, a âdsRNA silencing elementâ includes a dsRNA, a transcript or polyribonucleotide capable of forming a dsRNA or more than one transcript or polyribonucleotide capable of forming a dsRNA. âDouble stranded RNAâ or âdsRNAâ refers to a polyribonucleotide structure formed either by a single self-complementary RNA molecule or a polyribonucleotide structure formed by the expression of at least two distinct RNA strands. The dsRNA molecule(s) employed in the methods and compositions of the invention mediate the reduction of expression of a target sequence, for example, by mediating RNA interference âRNAiâ or gene silencing in a sequence-specific manner. In the context of the present invention, the dsRNA is capable of reducing or eliminating the level or expression of a target polynucleotide or the polypeptide encoded thereby in a pest.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The dsRNA can reduce or eliminate the expression level of the target sequence by influencing the level of the target RNA transcript, by influencing translation and thereby affecting the level of the encoded polypeptide, or by influencing expression at the pre-transcriptional level (i.e., via the modulation of chromatin structure, methylation pattern, etc., to alter gene expression). See, for example, Verdel et al. (2004) <i>Science </i>303:672-676; Pal-Bhadra et al. (2004) <i>Science </i>303:669-672; Allshire (2002) <i>Science </i>297:1818-1819; Volpe et al. (2002) <i>Science </i>297:1833-1837; Jenuwein (2002) <i>Science </i>297:2215-2218; and Hall et al. (2002) <i>Science </i>297:2232-2237. Methods to assay for functional dsRNA that are capable of reducing or eliminating the level of a sequence of interest are disclosed elsewhere herein. Accordingly, as used herein, the term âdsRNAâ is meant to encompass other terms used to describe nucleic acid molecules that are capable of mediating RNA interference or gene silencing, including, for example, short-interfering RNA (siRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA), hairpin RNA, short hairpin RNA (shRNA), post-transcriptional gene silencing RNA (ptgsRNA), and others.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In specific embodiments, at least one strand of the duplex or double-stranded region of the dsRNA shares sufficient sequence identity or sequence complementarity to the target polynucleotide to allow for the dsRNA to reduce the level of expression of the target sequence. As used herein, the strand that is complementary to the target polynucleotide is the âantisense strandâ and the strand homologous to the target polynucleotide is the âsense strand.â</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In another embodiment, the dsRNA comprises a hairpin RNA. A hairpin RNA comprises an RNA molecule that is capable of folding back onto itself to form a double stranded structure. Multiple structures can be employed as hairpin elements. In specific embodiments, the dsRNA suppression element comprises a hairpin element which comprises in the following order, a first segment, a second segment, and a third segment, where the first and the third segment share sufficient complementarity to allow the transcribed RNA to form a double-stranded stem-loop structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The âsecond segmentâ of the hairpin comprises a âloopâ or a âloop region.â These terms are used synonymously herein and are to be construed broadly to comprise any nucleotide sequence that confers enough flexibility to allow self-pairing to occur between complementary regions of a polynucleotide (i.e., segments 1 and 3 which form the stem of the hairpin). For example, in some embodiments, the loop region may be substantially single stranded and act as a spacer between the self-complementary regions of the hairpin stem-loop. In some embodiments, the loop region can comprise a random or nonsense nucleotide sequence and thus not share sequence identity to a target polynucleotide. In other embodiments, the loop region comprises a sense or an antisense RNA sequence or fragment thereof that shares identity to a target polynucleotide. See, for example, International Patent Publication No. WO 02/00904, herein incorporated by reference. In specific embodiments, the loop region can be optimized to be as short as possible while still providing enough intramolecular flexibility to allow the formation of the base-paired stem region. Accordingly, the loop sequence is generally less than 1000, 900, 800, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, 50, 25, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 10 nucleotides or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The âfirstâ and the âthirdâ segment of the hairpin RNA molecule comprise the base-paired stem of the hairpin structure. The first and the third segments are inverted repeats of one another and share sufficient complementarity to allow the formation of the base-paired stem region. In specific embodiments, the first and the third segments are fully complementary to one another. Alternatively, the first and the third segment may be partially complementary to each other so long as they are capable of hybridizing to one another to form a base-paired stem region. The amount of complementarity between the first and the third segment can be calculated as a percentage of the entire segment. Thus, the first and the third segment of the hairpin RNA generally share at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, up to and including 100% complementarity.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The first and the third segment are at least about 1000, 500, 475, 450, 425, 400, 375, 350, 325, 300, 250, 225, 200, 175, 150, 125, 100, 75, 60, 50, 40, 30, 25, 22, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15 or 10 nucleotides in length. In specific embodiments, the length of the first and/or the third segment is about 10-100 nucleotides, about 10 to about 75 nucleotides, about 10 to about 50 nucleotides, about 10 to about 40 nucleotides, about 10 to about 35 nucleotides, about 10 to about 30 nucleotides, about 10 to about 25 nucleotides, about 10 to about 19 nucleotides, about 10 to about 20 nucleotides, about 19 to about 50 nucleotides, about 50 nucleotides to about 100 nucleotides, about 100 nucleotides to about 150 nucleotides, about 100 nucleotides to about 300 nucleotides, about 150 nucleotides to about 200 nucleotides, about 200 nucleotides to about 250 nucleotides, about 250 nucleotides to about 300 nucleotides, about 300 nucleotides to about 350 nucleotides, about 350 nucleotides to about 400 nucleotides, about 400 nucleotide to about 500 nucleotides, about 600 nt, about 700 nt, about 800 nt, about 900 nt, about 1000 nt, about 1100 nt, about 1200 nt, 1300 nt, 1400 nt, 1500 nt, 1600 nt, 1700 nt, 1800 nt, 1900 nt, 2000 nt or longer. In other embodiments, the length of the first and/or the third segment comprises at least 10-19 nucleotides, 10-20 nucleotides; 19-35 nucleotides, 20-35 nucleotides; 30-45 nucleotides; 40-50 nucleotides; 50-100 nucleotides; 100-300 nucleotides; about 500-700 nucleotides; about 700-900 nucleotides; about 900-1100 nucleotides; about 1300-1500 nucleotides; about 1500-1700 nucleotides; about 1700-1900 nucleotides; about 1900-2100 nucleotides; about 2100-2300 nucleotides; or about 2300-2500 nucleotides. See, for example, International Publication No. WO 0200904.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Hairpin molecules or double-stranded RNA molecules of the present invention may have more than one sequence of the present invention or active fragments or variants, or complements thereof, found in the same portion of the RNA molecule. For example, in a chimeric hairpin structure, the first segment of a hairpin molecule comprises two polynucleotide sections, each with a different sequence of the present invention. For example, reading from one terminus of the hairpin, the first segment is composed of sequences from two separate genes (A followed by B). This first segment is followed by the second segment, the loop portion of the hairpin. The loop segment is followed by the third segment, where the complementary strands of the sequences in the first segment are found (B* followed by A*) in forming the stem-loop, hairpin structure, the stem contains SeqA-A* at the distal end of the stem and SeqB-B* proximal to the loop region.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In specific embodiments, the first and the third segment comprise at least 20 nucleotides having at least 85% complementary to the first segment. In still other embodiments, the first and the third segments which form the stem-loop structure of the hairpin comprises 3â² or 5â² overhang regions having unpaired nucleotide residues.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In specific embodiments, the sequences used in the first, the second, and/or the third segments comprise domains that are designed to have sufficient sequence identity to a target polynucleotide of interest and thereby have the ability to decrease the level of expression of the target polynucleotide. The specificity of the inhibitory RNA transcripts is therefore generally conferred by these domains of the silencing element. Thus, in some embodiments of the invention, the first, second and/or third segment of the silencing element comprise a domain having at least 10, at least 15, at least 19, at least 20, at least 21, at least 22, at least 23, at least 24, at least 25, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 100, at least 200, at least 300, at least 500, at least 1000, or more than 1000 nucleotides that share sufficient sequence identity to the target polynucleotide to allow for a decrease in expression levels of the target polynucleotide when expressed in an appropriate cell. In other embodiments, the domain is between about 15 to 50 nucleotides, about 19-35 nucleotides, about 20-35 nucleotides, about 25-50 nucleotides, about 19 to 75 nucleotides, about 20 to 75 nucleotides, about 40-90 nucleotides about 15-100 nucleotides 10-100 nucleotides, about 10 to about 75 nucleotides, about 10 to about 50 nucleotides, about 10 to about 40 nucleotides, about 10 to about 35 nucleotides, about 10 to about 30 nucleotides, about 10 to about 25 nucleotides, about 10 to about 20 nucleotides, about 10 to about 19 nucleotides, about 50 nucleotides to about 100 nucleotides, about 100 nucleotides to about 150 nucleotides, about 150 nucleotides to about 200 nucleotides, about 200 nucleotides to about 250 nucleotides, about 250 nucleotides to about 300 nucleotides, about 300 nucleotides to about 350 nucleotides, about 350 nucleotides to about 400 nucleotides, about 400 nucleotide to about 500 nucleotides or longer. In other embodiments, the length of the first and/or the third segment comprises at least 10-20 nucleotides, at least 10-19 nucleotides, 20-35 nucleotides, 30-45 nucleotides, 40-50 nucleotides, 50-100 nucleotides, or about 100-300 nucleotides.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In specific embodiments, the domain of the first, the second, and/or the third segment has 100% sequence identity to the target polynucleotide. In other embodiments, the domain of the first, the second and/or the third segment having homology to the target polypeptide have at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or greater sequence identity to a region of the target polynucleotide. The sequence identity of the domains of the first, the second and/or the third segments to the target polynucleotide need only be sufficient to decrease expression of the target polynucleotide of interest. See, for example, Chuang and Meyerowitz (2000) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>97:4985-4990; Stoutjesdijk et al. (2002) <i>Plant Physiol. </i>129:1723-1731; Waterhouse and Helliwell (2003) <i>Nat. Rev. Genet. </i>4:29-38; Pandolfini et al. <i>BMC Biotechnology </i>3:7, and U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030175965; each of which is herein incorporated by reference. A transient assay for the efficiency of hpRNA constructs to silence gene expression in vivo has been described by Panstruga et al. (2003) <i>Mol. Biol. Rep. </i>30:135-140, herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The amount of complementarity shared between the first, second, and/or third segment and the target polynucleotide or the amount of complementarity shared between the first segment and the third segment (i.e., the stem of the hairpin structure) may vary depending on the organism in which gene expression is to be controlled. Some organisms or cell types may require exact pairing or 100% identity, while other organisms or cell types may tolerate some mismatching. In some cells, for example, a single nucleotide mismatch in the targeting sequence abrogates the ability to suppress gene expression. In these cells, the suppression cassettes of the invention can be used to target the suppression of mutant genes, for example, oncogenes whose transcripts comprise point mutations and therefore they can be specifically targeted using the methods and compositions of the invention without altering the expression of the remaining wild-type allele. In other organisms, holistic sequence variability may be tolerated as long as some 22nt region of the sequence is represented in 100% homology between target polynucleotide and the suppression cassette.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Any region of the target polynucleotide can be used to design the domain of the silencing element that shares sufficient sequence identity to allow expression of the hairpin transcript to decrease the level of the target polynucleotide. For instance, the domain can be designed to share sequence identity to the 5â² untranslated region of the target polynucleotide(s), the 3â² untranslated region of the target polynucleotide(s), exonic regions of the target polynucleotide(s), intronic regions of the target polynucleotide(s), and any combination thereof. In specific embodiments, a domain of the silencing element shares sufficient homology to at least about 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25 or 30 consecutive nucleotides from about nucleotides 1-50, 25-75, 75-125, 50-100, 125-175, 175-225, 100-150, 150-200, 200-250, 225-275, 275-325, 250-300, 325-375, 375-425, 300-350, 350-400, 425-475, 400-450, 475-525, 450-500, 525-575, 575-625, 550-600, 625-675, 675-725, 600-650, 625-675, 675-725, 650-700, 725-825, 825-875, 750-800, 875-925, 925-975, 850-900, 925-975, 975-1025, 950-1000, 1000-1050, 1025-1075, 1075-1125, 1050-1100, 1125-1175, 1100-1200, 1175-1225, 1225-1275, 1200-1300, 1325-1375, 1375-1425, 1300-1400, 1425-1475, 1475-1525, 1400-1500, 1525-1575, 1575-1625, 1625-1675, 1675-1725, 1725-1775, 1775-1825, 1825-1875, 1875-1925, 1925-1975, 1975-2025, 2025-2075, 2075-2125, 2125-2175, 2175-2225, 1500-1600, 1600-1700, 1700-1800, 1800-1900, 1900-2000 of the target sequence. In some instances to optimize the siRNA sequences employed in the hairpin, the synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide/RNAse H method can be used to determine sites on the target mRNA that are in a conformation that is susceptible to RNA silencing. See, for example, Vickers et al. (2003) <i>J. Biol. Chem </i>278:7108-7118 and Yang et al. (2002) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>99:9442-9447, herein incorporated by reference. These studies indicate that there is a significant correlation between the RNase-H-sensitive sites and sites that promote efficient siRNA-directed mRNA degradation.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The hairpin silencing element may also be designed such that the sense sequence or the antisense sequence do not correspond to a target polynucleotide. In this embodiment, the sense and antisense sequence flank a loop sequence that comprises a nucleotide sequence corresponding to all or part of the target polynucleotide. Thus, it is the loop region that determines the specificity of the RNA interference. See, for example, WO 02/00904, herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In addition, transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) may be accomplished through use of a hairpin suppression element where the inverted repeat of the hairpin shares sequence identity with the promoter region of a target polynucleotide to be silenced. See, for example, Aufsatz et al. (2002) <i>PNAS </i>99 (Suppl. 4):16499-16506 and Mette et al. (2000) <i>EMBO J </i>19(19):5194-5201.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In other embodiments, the silencing element can comprise a small RNA (sRNA). sRNAs can comprise both micro RNA (miRNA) and short-interfering RNA (siRNA) (Meister and Tuschl (2004) <i>Nature </i>431:343-349 and Bonetta et al. (2004) <i>Nature Methods </i>1:79-86). miRNAs are regulatory agents comprising about 19 to about 24 ribonucleotides in length which are highly efficient at inhibiting the expression of target polynucleotides. See, for example Javier et al. (2003) <i>Nature </i>425: 257-263, herein incorporated by reference. For miRNA interference, the silencing element can be designed to express a dsRNA molecule that forms a hairpin structure or partially base-paired structure containing 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 or 25-nucleotide sequence that is complementary to the target polynucleotide of interest. The miRNA can be synthetically made, or transcribed as a longer RNA which is subsequently cleaved to produce the active miRNA. Specifically, the miRNA can comprise 19 nucleotides of the sequence having homology to a target polynucleotide in sense orientation and 19 nucleotides of a corresponding antisense sequence that is complementary to the sense sequence. The miRNA can be an âartificial miRNAâ or âamiRNAâ which comprises a miRNA sequence that is synthetically designed to silence a target sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">When expressing an miRNA the final (mature) miRNA is present in a duplex in a precursor backbone structure, the two strands being referred to as the miRNA (the strand that will eventually basepair with the target) and miRNA*(star sequence). It has been demonstrated that miRNAs can be transgenically expressed and target genes of interest efficiently silenced (Highly specific gene silencing by artificial microRNAs in <i>Arabidopsis </i>Schwab R, Ossowski S, Riester M, Warthmann N, Weigel D.

      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The silencing element for miRNA interference comprises a miRNA primary sequence. The miRNA primary sequence comprises a DNA sequence having the miRNA and star sequences separated by a loop as well as additional sequences flanking this region that are important for processing. When expressed as an RNA, the structure of the primary miRNA is such as to allow for the formation of a hairpin RNA structure that can be processed into a mature miRNA. In some embodiments, the miRNA backbone comprises a genomic or cDNA miRNA precursor sequence, wherein said sequence comprises a native primary in which a heterologous (artificial) mature miRNA and star sequence are inserted.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">As used herein, a âstar sequenceâ is the sequence within a miRNA precursor backbone that is complementary to the miRNA and forms a duplex with the miRNA to form the stem structure of a hairpin RNA. In some embodiments, the star sequence can comprise less than 100% complementarity to the miRNA sequence. Alternatively, the star sequence can comprise at least 99%, 98%, 97%, 96%, 95%, 90%, 85%, 80% or lower sequence complementarity to the miRNA sequence as long as the star sequence has sufficient complementarity to the miRNA sequence to form a double stranded structure. In still further embodiments, the star sequence comprises a sequence having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more mismatches with the miRNA sequence and still has sufficient complementarity to form a double stranded structure with the miRNA sequence resulting in production of miRNA and suppression of the target sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The miRNA precursor backbones can be from any plant. In some embodiments, the miRNA precursor backbone is from a monocot. In other embodiments, the miRNA precursor backbone is from a dicot. In further embodiments, the backbone is from maize or soybean. MicroRNA precursor backbones have been described previously. For example, US20090155910A1 (WO 2009/079532) discloses the following soybean miRNA precursor backbones: 156c, 159, 166b, 168c, 396b and 398b, and US20090155909A1 (WO 2009/079548) discloses the following maize miRNA precursor backbones: 159c, 164h, 168a, 169r, and 396h. Each of these references is incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Thus, the primary miRNA can be altered to allow for efficient insertion of heterologous miRNA and star sequences within the miRNA precursor backbone. In such instances, the miRNA segment and the star segment of the miRNA precursor backbone are replaced with the heterologous miRNA and the heterologous star sequences, designed to target any sequence of interest, using a PCR technique and cloned into an expression construct. It is recognized that there could be alterations to the position at which the artificial miRNA and star sequences are inserted into the backbone. Detailed methods for inserting the miRNA and star sequence into the miRNA precursor backbone are described in, for example, US Patent Applications 20090155909A1 and US20090155910A1, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">When designing a miRNA sequence and star sequence, various design choices can be made. See, for example, Schwab R, et al. (2005) Dev Cell 8: 517-27. In non-limiting embodiments, the miRNA sequences disclosed herein can have a âUâ at the 5â²-end, a âCâ or âGâ at the 19th nucleotide position, and an âAâ or âUâ at the 10th nucleotide position. In other embodiments, the miRNA design is such that the miRNA have a high free delta-G as calculated using the ZipFold algorithm (Markham, N. R. &amp; Zuker, M. (2005) Nucleic Acids Res. 33: W577-W581.) Optionally, a one base pair change can be added within the 5â² portion of the miRNA so that the sequence differs from the target sequence by one nucleotide.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The methods and compositions of the invention employ silencing elements that when transcribed âformâ a dsRNA molecule. Accordingly, the heterologous polynucleotide being expressed need not form the dsRNA by itself, but can interact with other sequences in the plant cell or in the pest gut after ingestion to allow the formation of the dsRNA. For example, a chimeric polynucleotide that can selectively silence the target polynucleotide can be generated by expressing a chimeric construct comprising the target sequence for a miRNA or siRNA to a sequence corresponding to all or part of the gene or genes to be silenced. In this embodiment, the dsRNA is âformedâ when the target for the miRNA or siRNA interacts with the miRNA present in the cell. The resulting dsRNA can then reduce the level of expression of the gene or genes to be silenced. See, for example, US Application Publication 2007-0130653, entitled âMethods and Compositions for Gene Silencingâ, herein incorporated by reference. The construct can be designed to have a target for an endogenous miRNA or alternatively, a target for a heterologous and/or synthetic miRNA can be employed in the construct. If a heterologous and/or synthetic miRNA is employed, it can be introduced into the cell on the same nucleotide construct as the chimeric polynucleotide or on a separate construct. As discussed elsewhere herein, any method can be used to introduce the construct comprising the heterologous miRNA.</p>

      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">âVariantsâ is intended to mean substantially similar sequences. For polynucleotides, a variant comprises a deletion and/or addition of one or more nucleotides at one or more internal sites within the native polynucleotide and/or a substitution of one or more nucleotides at one or more sites in the native polynucleotide. A variant of a polynucleotide that is useful as a silencing element will retain the ability to reduce expression of the target polynucleotide and, in some embodiments, thereby control a pest of interest. As used herein, a ânativeâ polynucleotide or polypeptide comprises a naturally occurring nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, respectively. For polynucleotides, conservative variants include those sequences that, because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, encode the amino acid sequence of one of the polypeptides employed in the invention. Variant polynucleotides also include synthetically derived polynucleotide, such as those generated, for example, by using site-directed mutagenesis, but continue to retain the desired activity. Generally, variants of a particular polynucleotide of the invention (i.e., a silencing element) will have at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity to that particular polynucleotide as determined by sequence alignment programs and parameters described elsewhere herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Variants of a particular polynucleotide of the invention (i.e., the reference polynucleotide) can also be evaluated by comparison of the percent sequence identity between the polypeptide encoded by a variant polynucleotide and the polypeptide encoded by the reference polynucleotide. Percent sequence identity between any two polypeptides can be calculated using sequence alignment programs and parameters described elsewhere herein. Where any given pair of polynucleotides employed in the invention is evaluated by comparison of the percent sequence identity shared by the two polypeptides they encode, the percent sequence identity between the two encoded polypeptides is at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between two or more polynucleotides or polypeptides: (a) âreference sequenceâ, (b) âcomparison windowâ, (c) âsequence identityâ, and, (d) âpercentage of sequence identity.â</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">(a) As used herein, âreference sequenceâ is a defined sequence used as a basis for sequence comparison. A reference sequence may be a subset or the entirety of a specified sequence; for example, as a segment of a full-length cDNA or gene sequence, or the complete cDNA or gene sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">(b) As used herein, âcomparison windowâ makes reference to a contiguous and specified segment of a polynucleotide sequence, wherein the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two polynucleotides. Generally, the comparison window is at least 20 contiguous nucleotides in length, and optionally can be 30, 40, 50, 100, or longer. Those of skill in the art understand that to avoid a high similarity to a reference sequence due to inclusion of gaps in the polynucleotide sequence a gap penalty is typically introduced and is subtracted from the number of matches.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">Unless otherwise stated, sequence identity/similarity values provided herein refer to the value obtained using GAP Version 10 using the following parameters: % identity and % similarity for a nucleotide sequence using GAP Weight of 50 and Length Weight of 3, and the nwsgapdna.cmp scoring matrix; % identity and % similarity for an amino acid sequence using GAP Weight of 8 and Length Weight of 2, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix; or any equivalent program thereof. By âequivalent programâ is intended any sequence comparison program that, for any two sequences in question, generates an alignment having identical nucleotide or amino acid residue matches and an identical percent sequence identity when compared to the corresponding alignment generated by GAP Version 10.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">(c) As used herein, âsequence identityâ or âidentityâ in the context of two polynucleotides or polypeptide sequences makes reference to the residues in the two sequences that are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence over a specified comparison window. When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by conservative amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other amino acid residues with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity) and therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. When sequences differ in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences that differ by such conservative substitutions are said to have âsequence similarityâ or âsimilarityâ. Means for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically this involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch, thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an identical amino acid is given a score of 1 and a non-conservative substitution is given a score of zero, a conservative substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, e.g., as implemented in the program PC/GENE (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif.).</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">(d) As used herein, âpercentage of sequence identityâ means the value determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison, and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.</p>

Methods of identifying such candidate fragments based on the desired pathway for suppression are known. For example, various bioinformatics programs can be employed to identify the region of the target polynucleotides that could be exploited to generate a silencing element.

It is recognized that multiple silencing elements including multiple identical silencing elements, multiple silencing elements targeting different regions of the target sequence, or multiple silencing elements from different target sequences can be used. In this embodiment, it is recognized that each silencing element can be contained in a single or separate cassette, DNA construct, or vector. As discussed, any means of providing the silencing element is contemplated. A plant or plant cell can be transformed with a single cassette comprising DNA encoding one or more silencing elements or separate cassettes comprising each silencing element can be used to transform a plant or plant cell or host cell. Likewise, a plant transformed with one component can be subsequently transformed with the second component. One or more silencing elements can also be brought together by sexual crossing. That is, a first plant comprising one component is crossed with a second plant comprising the second component. Progeny plants from the cross will comprise both components.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The expression cassette can include 5â² and 3â² regulatory sequences operably linked to the polynucleotide of the invention. âOperably linkedâ is intended to mean a functional linkage between two or more elements. For example, an operable linkage between a polynucleotide of the invention and a regulatory sequence (i.e., a promoter) is a functional link that allows for expression of the polynucleotide of the invention. Operably linked elements may be contiguous or non-contiguous. When used to refer to the joining of two protein coding regions, by operably linked is intended that the coding regions are in the same reading frame. The cassette may additionally contain at least one additional polynucleotide to be cotransformed into the organism. Alternatively, the additional polypeptide(s) can be provided on multiple expression cassettes. Expression cassettes can be provided with a plurality of restriction sites and/or recombination sites for insertion of the polynucleotide to be under the transcriptional regulation of the regulatory regions. The expression cassette may additionally contain selectable marker genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The expression cassette can include in the 5â²-3â² direction of transcription, a transcriptional and translational initiation region (i.e., a promoter), a polynucleotide comprising the silencing element employed in the methods and compositions of the invention, and a transcriptional and translational termination region (i.e., termination region) functional in plants. In other embodiment, the double stranded RNA is expressed from a suppression cassette. Such a cassette can comprise two convergent promoters that drive transcription of an operably linked silencing element. âConvergent promotersâ refers to promoters that are oriented on either terminus of the operably linked silencing element such that each promoter drives transcription of the silencing element in opposite directions, yielding two transcripts. In such embodiments, the convergent promoters allow for the transcription of the sense and anti-sense strand and thus allow for the formation of a dsRNA. Such a cassette may also comprise two divergent promoters that drive transcription of one or more operably linked silencing elements. âDivergent promotersâ refers to promoters that are oriented in opposite directions of each other, driving transcription of the one or more silencing elements in opposite directions. In such embodiments, the divergent promoters allow for the transcription of the sense and antisense strands and allow for the formation of a dsRNA. In such embodiments, the divergent promoters also allow for the transcription of at least two separate hairpin RNAs. In another embodiment, one cassette comprising two or more silencing elements under the control of two separate promoters in the same orientation is present in a construct. In another embodiment, two or more individual cassettes, each comprising at least one silencing element under the control of a promoter, are present in a construct in the same orientation.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The regulatory regions (i.e., promoters, transcriptional regulatory regions, and translational termination regions) and/or the polynucleotides employed in the invention may be native/analogous to the host cell or to each other. Alternatively, the regulatory regions and/or the polynucleotide employed in the invention may be heterologous to the host cell or to each other. As used herein, âheterologousâ in reference to a sequence is a sequence that originates from a foreign species, or, if from the same species, is substantially modified from its native form in composition and/or genomic locus by deliberate human intervention. For example, a promoter operably linked to a heterologous polynucleotide is from a species different from the species from which the polynucleotide was derived, or, if from the same/analogous species, one or both are substantially modified from their original form and/or genomic locus, or the promoter is not the native promoter for the operably linked polynucleotide. As used herein, a chimeric gene comprises a coding sequence operably linked to a transcription initiation region that is heterologous to the coding sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The termination region may be native with the transcriptional initiation region, may be native with the operably linked polynucleotide encoding the silencing element, may be native with the plant host, or may be derived from another source (i.e., foreign or heterologous) to the promoter, the polynucleotide comprising silencing element, the plant host, or any combination thereof. Convenient termination regions are available from the Ti-plasmid of <i>A. tumefaciens</i>, such as the octopine synthase and nopaline synthase termination regions. See also Guerineau et al.

      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">Additional sequence modifications are known to enhance gene expression in a cellular host. These include elimination of sequences encoding spurious polyadenylation signals, exon-intron splice site signals, transposon-like repeats, and other such well-characterized sequences that may be deleterious to gene expression. The G-C content of the sequence may be adjusted to levels average for a given cellular host, as calculated by reference to known genes expressed in the host cell. When possible, the sequence is modified to avoid predicted hairpin secondary mRNA structures.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">In preparing the expression cassette, the various DNA fragments may be manipulated, so as to provide for the DNA sequences in the proper orientation and, as appropriate, in the proper reading frame. Toward this end, adapters or linkers may be employed to join the DNA fragments or other manipulations may be involved to provide for convenient restriction sites, removal of superfluous DNA, removal of restriction sites, or the like. For this purpose, in vitro mutagenesis, primer repair, restriction, annealing, resubstitutions, e.g., transitions and transversions, may be involved.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">A number of promoters can be used in the practice of the invention. The polynucleotide encoding the silencing element can be combined with constitutive, tissue-preferred, or other promoters for expression in plants.</p>

Depending upon the objective, the promoter may be a chemical-inducible promoter, where application of the chemical induces gene expression, or a chemical-repressible promoter, where application of the chemical represses gene expression. Chemical-inducible promoters are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, the maize In2-2 promoter, which is activated by benzenesulfonamide herbicide safeners, the maize GST promoter, which is activated by hydrophobic electrophilic compounds that are used as pre-emergent herbicides, and the tobacco PR-1a promoter, which is activated by salicylic acid.

The promoters of these genes were linked to a Î²-glucuronidase reporter gene and introduced into both the nonlegume <i>Nicotiana tabacum </i>and the legume <i>Lotus corniculatus</i>, and in both instances root-specific promoter activity was preserved. Leach and Aoyagi (1991) describe their analysis of the promoters of the highly expressed rolC and rolD root-inducing genes of <i>Agrobacterium rhizogenes </i>(see <i>Plant Science </i>(Limerick) 79(1):69-76). They concluded that enhancer and tissue-preferred DNA determinants are dissociated in those promoters. Teeri et al. (1989) used gene fusion to lacZ to show that the <i>Agrobacterium </i>T-DNA gene encoding octopine synthase is especially active in the epidermis of the root tip and that the TR2â² gene is root specific in the intact plant and stimulated by wounding in leaf tissue, an especially desirable combination of characteristics for use with an insecticidal or larvicidal gene (see <i>EMBO J. </i>8(2):343-350).

In another example, a plant is transformed with a DNA construct or expression cassette for expression of at least one silencing element. In either composition, the silencing element, when ingested by an insect, can reduce the level of a target pest sequence and thereby control the pest (i.e., a Coleopteran plant pest including a <i>Diabrotica </i>plant pest, such as, <i>D. virgifera virgifera, D. barberi, D. virgifera zeae, D. speciosa</i>, or <i>D. undecimpunctata howardi</i>).

Compositions comprising a mixture of cells, some cells expressing at least one silencing element are also encompassed. In other embodiments, compositions comprising the silencing elements are not contained in a cell. In such embodiments, the composition can be applied to an area inhabited by a pest. In one embodiment, the composition is applied externally to a plant (i.e., by spraying a field or area of cultivation) to protect the plant from the pest. Methods of applying nucleotides in such a manner are known to those of skill in the art.</p>

Such carriers can be any material that the animal, plant or environment to be treated can tolerate. Furthermore, the carrier must be such that the composition remains effective at controlling a pest. Examples of such carriers include water, saline, Ringer's solution, dextrose or other sugar solutions, Hank's solution, and other aqueous physiologically balanced salt solutions, phosphate buffer, bicarbonate buffer and Tris buffer. In addition, the composition may include compounds that increase the half-life of a composition. Various insecticidal formulations can also be found in, for example, US Publications 2008/0275115, 2008/0242174, 2008/0027143, 2005/0042245, and 2004/0127520, each of which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">It is recognized that the polynucleotides comprising sequences encoding the silencing element can be used to transform organisms to provide for host organism production of these components, and subsequent application of the host organism to the environment of the target pest(s). Such host organisms include baculoviruses, bacteria, and the like. In this manner, the combination of polynucleotides encoding the silencing element may be introduced via a suitable vector into a microbial host, and said host applied to the environment, or to plants or animals.</p>

These microorganisms are selected so as to be capable of successfully competing in the particular environment with the wild-type microorganisms, provide for stable maintenance and expression of the sequences encoding the silencing element, and desirably, provide for improved protection of the components from environmental degradation and inactivation.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">Such microorganisms include bacteria, algae, and fungi. Of particular interest are microorganisms such as bacteria, e.g., <i>Pseudomonas, Erwinia, Serratia, Klebsiella, Xanthomonas, Streptomyces, Rhizobium, Rhodopseudomonas, Methylius, Agrobacterium, Acetobacter, Lactobacillus, Arthrobacter, Azotobacter, Leuconostoc</i>, and <i>Alcaligenes</i>, fungi, particularly yeast, e.g., <i>Saccharomyces, Cryptococcus, Kluyveromyces, Sporobolomyces, Rhodotorula</i>, and <i>Aureobasidium</i>.

      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">A number of ways are available for introducing the polynucleotide comprising the silencing element into the microbial host under conditions that allow for stable maintenance and expression of such nucleotide encoding sequences. For example, expression cassettes can be constructed which include the nucleotide constructs of interest operably linked with the transcriptional and translational regulatory signals for expression of the nucleotide constructs, and a nucleotide sequence homologous with a sequence in the host organism, whereby integration will occur, and/or a replication system that is functional in the host, whereby integration or stable maintenance will occur.</p>

      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">Alternatively, the components of the invention are produced by introducing heterologous genes into a cellular host. Expression of the heterologous sequences results, directly or indirectly, in the intracellular production of the silencing element. These compositions may then be formulated in accordance with conventional techniques for application to the environment hosting a target pest, e.g., soil, water, and foliage of plants.

Suitable carriers and adjuvants can be solid or liquid and correspond to the substances ordinarily employed in formulation technology, e.g., natural or regenerated mineral substances, solvents, dispersants, wetting agents, tackifiers, binders, or fertilizers. The active ingredients of the present invention (i.e., at least one silencing element) are normally applied in the form of compositions and can be applied to the crop area, plant, or seed to be treated. For example, the compositions may be applied to grain in preparation for or during storage in a grain bin or silo, etc. The compositions may be applied simultaneously or in succession with other compounds. Methods of applying an active ingredient or a composition that contains at least one silencing element include, but are not limited to, foliar application, seed coating, and soil application.

      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0110">The compositions (including the transformed microorganisms) can be applied to the environment of an insect pest (such as a Coleoptera plant pest or a <i>Diabrotica </i>plant pest) by, for example, spraying, atomizing, dusting, scattering, coating or pouring, introducing into or on the soil, introducing into irrigation water, by seed treatment or general application or dusting at the time when the pest has begun to appear or before the appearance of pests as a protective measure. For example, the composition(s) and/or transformed microorganism(s) may be mixed with grain to protect the grain during storage. It is generally important to obtain good control of pests in the early stages of plant growth, as this is the time when the plant can be most severely damaged. The compositions can conveniently contain another insecticide if this is thought necessary. In an embodiment of the invention, the composition(s) is applied directly to the soil, at a time of planting, in granular form of a composition of a carrier and dead cells of a <i>Bacillus </i>strain or transformed microorganism of the invention. Another embodiment is a granular form of a composition comprising an agrochemical such as, for example, a herbicide, an insecticide, a fertilizer, in an inert carrier, and dead cells of a <i>Bacillus </i>strain or transformed microorganism of the invention.</p>

      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0111">In one embodiment, the methods of the invention involve introducing a polynucleotide into a plant. âIntroducingâ is intended to mean presenting to the plant the polynucleotide in such a manner that the sequence gains access to the interior of a cell of the plant. The methods of the invention do not depend on a particular method for introducing a sequence into a plant, only that the polynucleotide or polypeptides gains access to the interior of at least one cell of the plant. Methods for introducing polynucleotides into plants are known in the art including, but not limited to, stable transformation methods, transient transformation methods, and virus-mediated methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0112">âStable transformationâ is intended to mean that the nucleotide construct introduced into a plant integrates into the genome of the plant and is capable of being inherited by the progeny thereof âTransient transformationâ is intended to mean that a polynucleotide is introduced into the plant and does not integrate into the genome of the plant or a polypeptide is introduced into a plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0113">Transformation protocols as well as protocols for introducing polypeptides or polynucleotide sequences into plants may vary depending on the type of plant or plant cell, i.e., monocot or dicot, targeted for transformation. Suitable methods of introducing polypeptides and polynucleotides into plant cells include microinjection (Crossway et al. (1986) <i>Biotechniques </i>4:320-334), electroporation (Riggs et al.

      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0114">In specific embodiments, the silencing element sequences of the invention can be provided to a plant using a variety of transient transformation methods. Such transient transformation methods include, but are not limited to, the introduction of the protein or variants and fragments thereof directly into the plant or the introduction of the transcript into the plant. Such methods include, for example, microinjection or particle bombardment. See, for example, Crossway et al. (1986) Mol Gen. Genet. 202:179-185; Nomura et al. (1986) Plant Sci. 44:53-58; Hepler et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 91: 2176-2180 and Hush et al. (1994) The Journal of Cell Science 107:775-784, all of which are herein incorporated by reference. Alternatively, polynucleotides can be transiently transformed into the plant using techniques known in the art. Such techniques include viral vector systems and the precipitation of the polynucleotide in a manner that precludes subsequent release of the DNA. Thus, the transcription from the particle-bound DNA can occur, but the frequency with which it is released to become integrated into the genome is greatly reduced. Such methods include the use of particles coated with polyethylimine (PEI; Sigma #P3143).</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0115">In other embodiments, the polynucleotide of the invention may be introduced into plants by contacting plants with a virus or viral nucleic acids. Generally, such methods involve incorporating a nucleotide construct of the invention within a viral DNA or RNA molecule. Further, it is recognized that promoters of the invention also encompass promoters utilized for transcription by viral RNA polymerases. Methods for introducing polynucleotides into plants and expressing a protein encoded therein, involving viral DNA or RNA molecules, are known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,889,191, 5,889,190, 5,866,785, 5,589,367, 5,316,931, and Porta et al. (1996) <i>Molecular Biotechnology </i>5:209-221; herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0116">Methods are known in the art for the targeted insertion of a polynucleotide at a specific location in the plant genome. In one embodiment, the insertion of the polynucleotide at a desired genomic location is achieved using a site-specific recombination system. See, for example, WO99/25821, WO99/25854, WO99/25840, WO99/25855, and WO99/25853, all of which are herein incorporated by reference. Briefly, the polynucleotide of the invention can be contained in transfer cassette flanked by two non-recombinogenic recombination sites. The transfer cassette is introduced into a plant having stably incorporated into its genome a target site which is flanked by two non-recombinogenic recombination sites that correspond to the sites of the transfer cassette. An appropriate recombinase is provided and the transfer cassette is integrated at the target site. The polynucleotide of interest is thereby integrated at a specific chromosomal position in the plant genome.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0117">The cells that have been transformed may be grown into plants in accordance with conventional ways. See, for example, McCormick et al. (1986) <i>Plant Cell Reports </i>5:81-84. These plants may then be grown, and either pollinated with the same transformed strain or different strains, and the resulting progeny having constitutive expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic identified. Two or more generations may be grown to ensure that expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic is stably maintained and inherited and then seeds harvested to ensure expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic has been achieved. In this manner, the present invention provides transformed seed (also referred to as âtransgenic seedâ) having a polynucleotide of the invention, for example, an expression cassette of the invention, stably incorporated into their genome.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0118">As used herein, the term plant includes plant cells, plant protoplasts, plant cell tissue cultures from which plants can be regenerated, plant calli, plant clumps, and plant cells that are intact in plants or parts of plants such as embryos, pollen, ovules, seeds, leaves, flowers, branches, fruit, kernels, ears, cobs, husks, stalks, roots, root tips, anthers, and the like. Grain is intended to mean the mature seed produced by commercial growers for purposes other than growing or reproducing the species. Progeny, variants, and mutants of the regenerated plants are also included within the scope of the invention, provided that these parts comprise the introduced polynucleotides.</p>

As used herein, the term âstackedâ includes having the multiple traits present in the same plant (i.e., both traits are incorporated into the nuclear genome, one trait is incorporated into the nuclear genome and one trait is incorporated into the genome of a plastid or both traits are incorporated into the genome of a plastid). In one non-limiting example, âstacked traitsâ comprise a molecular stack where the sequences are physically adjacent to each other. A trait, as used herein, refers to the phenotype derived from a particular sequence or groups of sequences. Co-transformation of polynucleotides can be carried out using single transformation vectors comprising multiple polynucleotides or polynucleotides carried separately on multiple vectors. If the sequences are stacked by genetically transforming the plants, the polynucleotide sequences of interest can be combined at any time and in any order. The traits can be introduced simultaneously in a co-transformation protocol with the polynucleotides of interest provided by any combination of transformation cassettes. For example, if two sequences will be introduced, the two sequences can be contained in separate transformation cassettes (trans) or contained on the same transformation cassette (cis). Expression of the sequences can be driven by the same promoter or by different promoters. It is further recognized that polynucleotide sequences can be stacked at a desired genomic location using a site-specific recombination system. See, for example, WO 1999/25821, WO 1999/25854, WO 1999/25840, WO 1999/25855 and WO 1999/25853, all of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>

      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0126">Transgenes useful for stacking include, but are not limited to, to those as described herein below.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0127">i. Transgenes that Confer Resistance to Insects or Disease</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0128">(A) Plant disease resistance genes. Plant defenses are often activated by specific interaction between the product of a disease resistance gene (R) in the plant and the product of a corresponding avirulence (Avr) gene in the pathogen. A plant variety can be transformed with cloned resistance gene to engineer plants that are resistant to specific pathogen strains. See, for example, Jones, et al., (1994) Science 266:789 (cloning of the tomato Cf-9 gene for resistance to <i>Cladosporium fulvum</i>); Martin, et al., (1993) Science 262:1432 (tomato Pto gene for resistance to <i>Pseudomonas syringae </i>pv. tomato encodes a protein kinase); Mindrinos, et al., (1994) Cell 78:1089 (<i>Arabidopsis </i>RSP2 gene for resistance to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>), McDowell and Woffenden, (2003) Trends Biotechnol. 21(4):178-83 and Toyoda, et al., (2002) Transgenic Res. 11(6):567-82. A plant resistant to a disease is one that is more resistant to a pathogen as compared to the wild type plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0129">(B) Genes encoding a <i>Bacillus thuringiensis </i>protein, a derivative thereof or a synthetic polypeptide modeled thereon. See, for example, Geiser, et al., (1986) Gene 48:109, who disclose the cloning and nucleotide sequence of a Bt delta-endotoxin gene.

      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0171">There are several methods of conferring genetic male sterility available, such as multiple mutant genes at separate locations within the genome that confer male sterility, as disclosed in U.S. Pat.

In addition to these methods, Albertsen, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,068, describe a system of nuclear male sterility which includes: identifying a gene which is critical to male fertility; silencing this native gene which is critical to male fertility; removing the native promoter from the essential male fertility gene and replacing it with an inducible promoter; inserting this genetically engineered gene back into the plant; and thus creating a plant that is male sterile because the inducible promoter is not âonâ resulting in the male fertility gene not being transcribed. Fertility is restored by inducing or turning âonâ, the promoter, which in turn allows the gene that confers male fertility to be transcribed. Non-limiting examples include: (A) Introduction of a deacetylase gene under the control of a tapetum-specific promoter and with the application of the chemical N-Ac-PPT (WO 2001/29237); (B) Introduction of various stamen-specific promoters (WO 1992/13956, WO 1992/13957); and (C) Introduction of the barnase and the barstar gene (Paul, et al., (1992) Plant Mol.

      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0183">These stacked combinations can be created by any method including, but not limited to, cross-breeding plants by any conventional or TopCross methodology, or genetic transformation. If the sequences are stacked by genetically transforming the plants (i.e., molecular stacks), the polynucleotide sequences of interest can be combined at any time and in any order. For example, a transgenic plant comprising one or more desired traits can be used as the target to introduce further traits by subsequent transformation. The traits can be introduced simultaneously in a co-transformation protocol with the polynucleotides of interest provided by any combination of transformation cassettes. For example, if two sequences will be introduced, the two sequences can be contained in separate transformation cassettes (trans) or contained on the same transformation cassette (cis). Expression of the sequences can be driven by the same promoter or by different promoters. In certain cases, it may be desirable to introduce a transformation cassette that will suppress the expression of the polynucleotide of interest. This may be combined with any combination of other suppression cassettes or overexpression cassettes to generate the desired combination of traits in the plant. It is further recognized that polynucleotide sequences can be stacked at a desired genomic location using a site-specific recombination system.

      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0185">A cDNA library was produced from neonate western corn rootworm larvae by standard methods. A selected cDNA clone containing an expressed sequence tag was amplified in a PCR using universal primers to the plasmid backbone and flanking the EST insert. The universal primers also contained T7 RNA polymerase sites. The product of the PCR reaction was used as the template for an in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction to produce long double stranded RNAs. Following enzymatic digestion and removal of the DNA template and single stranded RNA, the IVT reaction products were incorporated into artificial insect diet as described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0186">Different target selection strategies were used in this invention to identify RNAi active targets with insecticidal activities in corn rootworn diet based assay. cDNA libraries were produced from neonate or midgut of 3rd instar western corn rootworm larvae by standard methods. Randomly selected cDNA clones containing an expressed sequence tag (EST) were amplified in a PCR using target specific primers (forward and reverse Table 1), and provided in the sequence listing included herein, to generate DNA templates. The target specific primers also contain T7 RNA polymerase sites (T7 sequence at 5â² end of each primer). Second set of cDNA clones was selected based on homology to known lethal genes from other insects, primarily <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. A third set of genes was tested based on involvement in proteasome functions. Identification of these genes was based on a progressive homology search beginning with a list of proteosome genes identified in humans cross referenced to the Tribolium genome database. Hits from Tribolium were then used to parse western corn rootworm sequence database. Proteosome genes were categorized as 26S subunit non ATPase, 26S subunit ATPase, alpha type, and beta type genes.</p>

      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0188">dsRNAs were incorporated into standard WCRW artificial diet at a final concentration of 50 ppm in a 96 well microtiter plate format. 5 Î¼l of the IVT reaction (300 ng/ul) were added to a given well of a 96 well microtiter plate. 25 Î¼l of molten lowmelt Western corn rootworm diet were added to the sample and shaken on an orbital shaker to mix the sample and diet. Once the diet has solidified, eight wells were used for each RNA sample. Preconditioned 1<sup>st </sup>instar WCRW (neonate insects were placed on neutral diet for 24 hours prior to transfer to test material) were added to the 96 well microtiter plates at a rate of 3-5 insects/well. Plates were sealed with mylar which was then punctured twice above each well of the microtiter plate using a superfine insect collection pin. To prevent drying of the diet, plates were first placed inside a plastic bag with a slightly damp cloth and the bags were placed inside an incubator set at 28Â° C. and 70% RH. The assay was scored for mortality and stunting affects after 7 days and an average was determined based on assignment of numeric values to each category of impact (3=mortality, 2=severe stunting, 1=stunting, 0=no affect). The number reported in this and all diet assay tables reflect the average score across all observations. A score of 3 represents complete mortality across all observations. A score of 2.5 would indicate half the wells demonstrating mortality and half scored as severe stunting. The assay results can be found in Table 1A.</p>

Two WCR larvae are infested per root in each dish with a fine tip paintbrush. The dishes are sealed with Parafilm to prevent the larvae from escaping. The assays are placed into a 27Â° C., 60% RH Percival incubator incomplete darkness. Contamination and larval quality are monitored. After six days of feeding on root tissue, the larvae are transferred to WCR diet in a 96 well plate. The larvae are allowed to feed on the diet for eight days making the full assay fourteen days long. Larval mass and survivorship are recorded for analysis. A one-way ANOVA analysis and a Dunnett's test is performed on the larval mass data to look for statistical significance compared to an untransformed negative control (HC69). WCR larvae stunting is measured after feeding on two events and compared to growth of larvae fed on negative control plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0203">In other assays, transgenic corn plants (R0) generated are planted into 10-inch pots containing Metromix soil after reaching an appropriate size. When plants reach the V4 growth stage, approximately 400 Western corn rootworm (WCR, <i>Diabrotica virgifera</i>) eggs are infested into the root zone. Non-transgenic corn of the same genotype is infested at a similar growth stage to serve as a negative control. Eggs are pre-incubated so hatch occurs within 24 hours of infestation. Larvae are allowed to feed on the root systems for 3 weeks. Plants are removed from the soil and washed so that the roots can be evaluated for larval feeding. Root damage is rated using a Node Injury Scale (NIS) to score the level of damage where a 0 indicates no damage, a 1 indicates that one node of roots is pruned to within 1.5 inches, a 2 indicates that 2 nodes are pruned, while a 3 indicates that 3 nodes are pruned. Because the plants being used for evaluation are directly out of tissue culture after transformation and because transformation events are unique, only a single plant is evaluated per event at this time. The plants in the assay that present signs or symptoms of larval feeding indicate that a successful infestation is obtained. Negative control plant roots are moderately to severely damaged averaging whereas roots of the transgenic plants provide substantial control of larval feeding, with about 0.2 or less on the Corn Rootworm Nodal Injury Score (âCRWNISâ).</p>

        <i>Agrobacterium</i>-Mediated Transformation of Maize</heading>
      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0206">For <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated maize transformation with the disclosed polynucleotide constructs comprising a silencing element as disclosed herein, the method of Zhao was employed (U.S. Pat. No. 5,981,840 and International Patent Publication Number WO 1998/32326, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference). Briefly, immature embryos were isolated from maize and the embryos contacted with an <i>Agrobacterium </i>suspension, where the bacteria were capable of transferring the desired disclosed polynucleotide constructs comprising a silencing element as disclosed herein, e.g. the polynucleotide construct shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, to at least one cell of at least one of the immature embryos (step 1: the infection step). In this step the immature embryos were immersed in an <i>Agrobacterium </i>suspension for the initiation of inoculation. The embryos were co-cultured for a time with the <i>Agrobacterium </i>(step 2: the co-cultivation step). The immature embryos were cultured on solid medium following the infection step. Following this co-cultivation period an optional resting step was contemplated. In this resting step, the embryos were incubated in the presence of at least one antibiotic known to inhibit <i>Agrobacterium </i>growth without a plant transformant selective agent (step 3: resting step). The immature embryos were cultured on solid medium with antibiotic, but without a selecting agent, for <i>Agrobacterium </i>elimination and for a resting phase for the infected cells. Next, inoculated embryos were cultured on medium containing a selective agent and growing transformed callus is recovered (step 4: the selection step). The immature embryos were cultured on solid medium with a selective agent resulting in the selective growth of transformed cells. The callus was then regenerated into plants (step 5: the regeneration step), and calli grown on selective medium were cultured on solid medium to regenerate the plants.</p>
