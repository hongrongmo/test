      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention is in the field of dishwashing. In particular, it relates to an automatic dishwashing detergent composition comprising an alkyl ether sulfate.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Automatic dishwashing is an art very different from fabric laundering. Fabric laundering is normally done in purpose-built machines having a tumbling action. These are very different from automatic dishwashing machines which instead of having a tumbling action typically have a rotating spray arm with a plurality of jets that sprays cleaning solution onto the dishware. The spray arm rotation is created by pumping water into the arm. The pump action makes the dishwashing operation prone to foam formation. Foam can easily overflow the low sills of the dishwashing machines and slow down or stop the arm rotation due to having air and foam filling the arms instead of water, which in turn reduces the cleaning action and can even bring the dishwasher to a halt. Therefore, in the field of automatic dishwashing machines the use of foam-producing detergent components is normally restricted.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Automatic dishwashing detergent compositions are undergoing continual change and improvement. Typically, in other types of cleaning compositions such as laundry detergent compositions, cleaning improvements are made by changing and improving the surfactants used. However, as noted hereinbefore, automatic dishwashing detergent compositions have the unique limitation of requiring very low foaming, which is incompatible with most of the surfactant systems typically used in other cleaning compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Currently, automatic dishwashing detergent compositions typically use low foaming non-ionic surfactants for filming and spotting prevention rather than for cleaning. The cleaning performance of the non-ionic surfactants used in automatic dishwashing has generally been very limited due to the requirement of low foam. Usually, low foaming non-ionic surfactants have limited solubility in the wash solution. The lack of solubility of such non-ionic surfactants greatly limits their cleaning abilities. Attempts at utilizing the more commonly used high foaming surfactants, such as anionic surfactants, have typically failed due to unacceptable foaming of such surfactants. Thus, there continues to be a need for automatic dishwashing detergent compositions containing surfactants which provide cleaning benefits without unacceptably high foaming. In addition, there is a need for automatic dishwashing detergent compositions more environmentally friendly and that are more energy efficient especially at low temperatures. Some of the ingredients of automatic dishwashing compositions do not work well at low temperatures, this is the case with for example bleach. Bleach activity seems to be highly reduced at low temperatures. Some enzymes work better a low temperature.</p>

      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0019">AES surfactants include those surface-active compounds that contain an organic hydrophobic group containing generally 8 to 22 carbon atoms or generally 8 to 18 carbon atoms in their molecular structure and sulphate as water-solubilizing group. Usually, the hydrophobic group will comprise a C8-C22 alkyl, or acyl group. Such surfactants are employed in the form of water-soluble salts and the salt-forming cation usually is selected from sodium, potassium, ammonium, magnesium and mono-, di- or tri-C2-C3 alkanolammonium, with the sodium cation being preferred.</p>

      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0020">The alkoxy group (R<sub>2</sub>) could be selected from ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy or even higher alkoxy groups and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the alkoxy group is ethoxy. When the alkyl ether sulphate surfactant is a mixture of surfactants, the alkoxylation degree is the weight average alkoxylation degree of all the components of the mixture (weight average alkoxylation degree). In the weight average alkoxylation degree calculation the weight of alkyl ether sulphate surfactant components not having alkoxylated groups should also be included.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0021">Weight average alkoxylation degree n=(x1*alkoxylation degree of surfactant 1+x2*alkoxylation degree of surfactant 2+ . . . )/(x1+x2+ . . . )</p>

Preferably, the branching group is an alkyl. Typically, the alkyl is selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, cyclic alkyl groups and mixtures thereof. Single or multiple alkyl branches could be present on the main hydrocarbyl chain of the starting alcohol(s) used to produce the alkyl ether sulphate surfactant used in the detergent of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0023">The branched alkyl ether sulphate surfactant can be a single sulphate surfactant or a mixture of sulphate surfactants. In the case of a single sulphate surfactant the percentage of branching refers to the weight percentage of the hydrocarbyl chains that are branched in the original alcohol from which the sulphate surfactant is derived.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0024">In the case of a sulphate surfactant mixture the percentage of branching is the weight average and it is defined according to the following formula:</p>

      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0042">According to this nomenclature, for instance the substitution of glutamic acid for glycine in position 195 is shown as G195E. A deletion of glycine in the same position is shown as G195*, and insertion of an additional amino acid residue such as lysine is shown as G195GK. Where a specific enzyme contains a âdeletionâ in comparison with other enzyme and an insertion is made in such a position this is indicated as *36D for insertion of an aspartic acid in position 36. Multiple mutations are separated by pluses, i.e.: S99G+V102N, representing mutations in positions 99 and 102 substituting serine and valine for glycine and asparagine, respectively. Where the amino acid in a position (e.g. 102) may be substituted by another amino acid selected from a group of amino acids, e.g. the group consisting of N and I, this will be indicated by V102N/I.</p>

      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0045">The relatedness between two amino acid sequences is described by the parameter âidentityâ. For purposes of the present invention, the alignment of two amino acid sequences is determined by using the Needle program from the EMBOSS package (http://emboss.org) version 2.8.0. The Needle program implements the global alignment algorithm described in Needleman, S. B. and Wunsch, C. D. (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48, 443-453. The substitution matrix used is BLOSUM62, gap opening penalty is 10, and gap extension penalty is 0.5.</p>

The result is expressed in percent identity. An exact match occurs when the âinvention sequenceâ and the âforeign sequenceâ have identical amino acid residues in the same positions of the overlap. The length of a sequence is the number of amino acid residues in the sequence.</p>

By a ânon-ionic surfactant systemâ is meant herein a mixture of two or more non-ionic surfactants. Preferred for use herein are non-ionic surfactant systems. They seem to have improved cleaning and finishing properties and better stability in product than single non-ionic surfactants.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0081">Phase inversion temperature is the temperature below which a surfactant, or a mixture thereof, partitions preferentially into the water phase as oil-swollen micelles and above which it partitions preferentially into the oil phase as water swollen inverted micelles. Phase inversion temperature can be determined visually by identifying at which temperature cloudiness occurs.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0082">The phase inversion temperature of a non-ionic surfactant or system can be determined as follows: a solution containing 1% of the corresponding surfactant or mixture by weight of the solution in distilled water is prepared. The solution is stirred gently before phase inversion temperature analysis to ensure that the process occurs in chemical equilibrium. The phase inversion temperature is taken in a thermostable bath by immersing the solutions in 75 mm sealed glass test tube. To ensure the absence of leakage, the test tube is weighed before and after phase inversion temperature measurement. The temperature is gradually increased at a rate of less than 1Â° C. per minute, until the temperature reaches a few degrees below the pre-estimated phase inversion temperature. Phase inversion temperature is determined visually at the first sign of turbidity.</p>

      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0104">Preferably the composition of the invention is a unit-dose product. Products in unit dose form include tablets, capsules, sachets, pouches, injection moulded compartments, etc. Preferred for use herein are tablets and unit dose form wrapped with a water-soluble film (including wrapped tablets, capsules, sachets, pouches) and injection moulded containers. The unit dose form of the invention is preferably a water-soluble multi-compartment pack. Preferably, the polyalkyleneimine and the bleach are placed in different compartments, this contributes to the stability of the product.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0105">A multi-compartments pack is formed by a plurality of water-soluble enveloping materials which form a plurality of compartments, one of the compartments would contain the composition of the invention, another compartment can contain a liquid composition, the liquid composition can be aqueous (i.e. comprises more than 10% of water by weight of the liquid composition) and the compartment can be made of warm water soluble material. In some embodiments the compartment comprising the composition of the invention is made of cold water soluble material. It allows for the separation and controlled release of different ingredients. In other embodiments all the compartments are made of warm water soluble material.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0106">Preferred packs comprise at least two side-by-side compartments superposed (i.e., placed above) onto another compartment, especially preferred are pouches. This disposition contributes to the compactness, robustness and strength of the pack, additionally, it minimise the amount of water-soluble material required. It only requires three pieces of material to form three compartments. The robustness of the pack allows also for the use of very thin films without compromising the physical integrity of the pack. The pack is also very easy to use because the compartments do not need to be folded to be used in machine dispensers of fix geometry. At least two of the compartments of the pack contain two different compositions. By âdifferent compositionsâ herein is meant compositions that differ in at least one ingredient.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0107">Preferably, at least one of the compartments contains a solid composition, preferably in powder form and another compartment an aqueous liquid composition, the compositions are preferably in a solid to liquid weight ratio of from about 20:1 to about 1:20, more preferably from about 18:1 to about 2:1 and even more preferably from about 15:1 to about 5:1. This kind of pack is very versatile because it can accommodate compositions having a broad spectrum of values of solid:liquid ratio. Particularly preferred have been found to be pouches having a high solid:liquid ratio because many of the detergent ingredients are most suitable for use in solid form, preferably in powder form. The ratio solid:liquid defined herein refers to the relationship between the weight of all the solid compositions and the weight of all the liquid compositions in the pack.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0108">Preferably solid:liquid weight ratio is from about 2:1 to about 18:1, more preferably from about 5:1 to about 15:1. These weight ratios are suitable in cases in which most of the ingredients of the detergent are in liquid form.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0109">Preferably the two side-by-side compartments contain liquid compositions, which can be the same but preferably are different and another compartment contains a solid composition, preferably in powder form, more preferably a densified powder. The solid composition contributes to the strength and robustness of the pack.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0110">For dispenser fit reasons, especially in an automatic dishwasher, the unit dose form products herein have a square or rectangular base and a height of from about 1 to about 5 cm, more preferably from about 1 to about 4 cm. Preferably the weight of the solid composition is from about 5 to about 20 grams, more preferably from about 10 to about 15 grams and the weight of the liquid compositions is from about 0.5 to about 4 grams, more preferably from about 0.8 to about 3 grams.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0111">In preferred embodiments, at least two of the films which form different compartments have different solubility, under the same conditions, releasing the content of the compositions which they partially or totally envelope at different times.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0112">Controlled release of the ingredients of a multi-compartment pouch can be achieved by modifying the thickness of the film and/or the solubility of the film material. The solubility of the film material can be delayed by for example cross-linking the film as described in WO 02/102,955 at pages 17 and 18. Other water-soluble films designed for rinse release are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,765,916 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,972,017. Waxy coating (see WO 95/29982) of films can help with rinse release. pH controlled release means are described in WO 04/111178, in particular amino-acetylated polysaccharide having selective degree of acetylation.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0113">Other means of obtaining delayed release by multi-compartment pouches with different compartments, where the compartments are made of films having different solubility are taught in WO 02/08380.</p>
      <heading id="h-00020-en" level="2">Suds Suppressor</heading>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0114">Suds suppressors can be an alkyl phosphate ester suds suppressor, a silicone suds suppressor, or combinations thereof. Suds suppressor technology and other defoaming agents useful herein are documented in âDefoaming, Theory and Industrial Applications,â Ed., P. R. Garrett, Marcel Dekker, N.Y., 1973, incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0115">Suds suppressors are preferably included in the automatic dishwashing detergent composition. The suds suppressor is included in the composition at a level of from about 0.0001% to about 10%, in another embodiment from about 0.001% to about 5%, from about 0.01% to about 1.5%, from about 0.01% to about 0.5%, by weight of the composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0116">Silicone based suds suppressor are quite suited for the compositions of the invention. Silicone suds suppressor technology and other defoaming agents useful herein are extensively documented in âDefoaming, Theory and Industrial Applicationsâ, Ed., P. R. Garrett, Marcel Dekker, N.Y., 1973, ISBN 0-8247-8770-6, incorporated herein by reference. See especially the chapters entitled âFoam control in Detergent Productsâ (Ferch et al) and âSurfactant Antifoamsâ (Blease et al). See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,933,672 and 4,136,045. In one embodiment, the silicone based suds suppressors is polydimethylsiloxanes having trimethylsilyl, or alternate end blocking units may be used as the silicone. These may be compounded with silica and/or with surface-active nonsilicon components, as illustrated by a suds suppressor comprising 12% silicone/silica, 18% stearyl alcohol and 70% starch in granular form. A suitable commercial source of the silicone active compounds is Dow Corning Corp. Silicone based suds suppressors are useful in that the silica works well to suppress the foam generated by the high foaming non-ionic surfactant.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0117">Other silicone based suds suppressor comprises solid silica, in another embodiment, a silicone fluid, in another embodiment a silicone resin, in another embodiment, silica. The silicone based suds suppressor can be in the form of a granule, in another embodiment, a liquid.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0118">The silicone based suds suppressor can comprise dimethylpolysiloxane, a hydrophilic polysiloxane compound having polyethylenoxy-propylenoxy group in the side chain, and a micro-powdery silica.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0119">A phosphate ester suds suppressor may also be used. Suitable alkyl phosphate esters contain from 16-20 carbon atoms. Such phosphate ester suds suppressors may be monostearyl acid phosphate or monooleyl acid phosphate or salts thereof, in one embodiment alkali metal salts.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0120">The dimensions and values disclosed herein are not to be understood as being strictly limited to the exact numerical values recited.
