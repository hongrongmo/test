      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The invention relates generally to the field of teething toys, and in particular to the field of teething toys that are worn by a parent or caretaker. Teething toys for babies are well-known; chewable, bendable, and deformable plastic objects are generally provided, often with textured surfaces, which are understood to be tactilely interesting to babies and soothing to teething gums when chewed upon. Universally, such toys are frequently soiled by dropping as baby users lose their grips or spit the toys out. To address this, the instant invention is directed toward attaching the teething toy to the wrist of a parent or caretaker.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Accordingly, the invention is directed to a bracelet to be worn by an adult caretaker of an infant or baby. A washable terry cloth bracelet fastens around the wearer's wrist with hook and loop fabric or other suitable fastener. A plurality of loops is sewn to the bracelet around its lower circumference and retains a set of teething rings. The rings may be removable or non-removable. In addition, a plurality of smaller loops is also sewn to the lower circumference of the bracelet. These loops may be used to attach additional toys, charms and other articles that wearer may like to provide for the baby or display. The bracelet, large and small loops, and teething rings may be provided in a wide variety of colors, shapes, patterns, styles, and designs.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention.</p>

      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Referring now to the invention in more detail, the invention is directed to a bracelet to be worn by an adult caretaker of an infant or baby. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows a front view of the first exemplary embodiment. In the first exemplary embodiment, a bracelet <b>100</b> is provided. The bracelet <b>100</b> is sized to fit around the wrist of an adult user. The bracelet <b>100</b> is preferably made of a soft fabric material, for example knit terry cloth. <figref>FIG. 2</figref> shows the first exemplary embodiment viewed from the back. Visible in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a seam and fastener <b>200</b>. The fastener <b>200</b> is preferably a hook and loop fastener, although other fasteners such as buttons, snaps, hooks, and the like may also be used. The material of the bracelet <b>100</b> may be provided in any color, pattern, or print, and may bear any indicia (e.g. popular sports team logos).</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Sewn or otherwise attached to the lower circumference of the bracelet <b>100</b> is a plurality of large loops <b>101</b> and small loops <b>102</b>. The loops <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> may be made of fabric, ribbon, yarn, or similar material and are preferably attached with reinforced stitching or other fastener of high tensile strength as the loops <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> may experience substantial pulling forces during use. The loops <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are fastened on both sides as opposed to being openable or removable. The linked objects are limited to permanently attached objects placed at the time of manufacture or removable objects which themselves may link around a fixed loop. As with the bracelet <b>100</b>, the loops <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> may be provided in any color, pattern, or print or bear any indicia.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Linked to the large loops <b>101</b> is a plurality of toys or teething objects <b>103</b>, for example the rings of various shapes and sizes shown. The teething toys <b>103</b> are preferably made of durable and flexible non-toxic plastic materials (i.e. âteething-safeâ), and suitable for mechanized cleaning in a washing machine or dishwasher (i.e. âdishwasher-safeâ). The teething toys <b>103</b> are preferably provided in a variety of colors, patterns, designs, and surface textures. Any of the teething toys <b>103</b> may contain a freezable liquid within a hollow cavity to allow the toy to provide a soothing cold sensation to the baby user. The teething toys <b>103</b> may be permanently linked to the large loops <b>101</b> at the time of manufacture, or may be made removable through a gap or fastening mechanism in their own structure. The small loops <b>102</b> are preferably left unfilled at the time of manufacture for the user to attach his or her own toys or objects of interest.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> shows the invention in use. In the scene of <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, a caretaker <b>300</b> wears the bracelet <b>100</b> on her wrist. The wearer presents the toys <b>103</b> to a baby <b>301</b> to play with and/or chew. The baby <b>301</b> as shown is older and capable of sitting up, however the invention is appropriate for children from birth, through the onset of teething (as early as 3 months), and up through the end of teething and interest in textured chew toys (as late as 18 months).</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Components, component sizes, and materials listed above are preferable, but artisans will recognize that alternate components and materials could be selected without altering the scope of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">While the foregoing written description of the invention enables one of ordinary skill to make and use what is presently considered to be the best mode thereof, those of ordinary skill in the art will understand and appreciate the existence of variations, combinations, and equivalents of the specific embodiment, method, and examples herein. The invention should, therefore, not be limited by the above described embodiment, method, and examples, but by all embodiments and methods within the scope and spirit of the invention.</p>
