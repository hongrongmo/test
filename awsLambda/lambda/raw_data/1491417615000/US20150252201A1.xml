      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention describes pigment dispersions of a predetermined particle size employed for offset lithographic, flexographic, gravure and screen printing applications. The present invention also describes novel ink compositions including pigment dispersions.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Pigments have been used by civilizations for thousands of years as a tool for expression. In ancient times, pigments were cast onto walls or murals to depict epic stories that were passed down from one generation to the next. In modern times, pigments have been used in various applications such as, for example, primary or secondary packaging, graphic arts, waterborne paints, cosmetics, pharmaceutical preparations, automotive coatings, industrial coatings.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Pigments are generally employed in combination with a binder/vehicle and intimately admixed into a carrier/solvent to ensure a stable dispersion. Stable dispersions require complete wetting of the pigments and their even distribution in the surrounding vehicle. Namely, these stable dispersions are colloidal suspensions which do not settle under their own gravitational forces. By so doing, the dispersed particles avoid reagglomeration and flocculation during further processing or storage.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">To ensure maximum color strength, a narrow distribution of small sized pigment particles is preferred in a dispersion. Specifically, color strength is proportional to the exposed surface area of the pigment. Other characteristics such as gloss and transparency also are improved. With ever-increasing demands from consumers for end-products exhibiting improved color strength, gloss and transparency, a need thus exists in the market for pigment dispersions with small pigment particle sizes without compromising on stability. A further need exists in the art for employing such pigment dispersions and end-products, such as ink, coatings, or paints, in contact printing applications such as offset lithography, flexography, gravure printing and screen printing.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">From a manufacturing perspective, pigments are the most expensive component of the pigment dispersion. With rising production costs and reduced profit margins in the manufacturing industry, cost-cutting measures have become a top priority for most pigment dispersion and ink manufacturers. A need thus exists for a pigment dispersion employing reduced pigment amounts while maintaining equal or improved color strength, gloss and transparency characteristics. A further need yet exists in the art for employing reduced pigment amounts in pigment dispersions and inks employed in contact printing applications such as offset lithography, flexography, gravure, and screen printing applications, different from non-contact printing applications such as ink jet printing.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">It has surprisingly been found by the inventors that their pigment dispersions exhibit improved color strength, gloss and transparency in printing applications such as offset lithography, flexography, gravure and screen printing. Improved color characteristics also is exhibited in coating and ink formulations employing such pigment dispersions. The ink is applied onto articles existing in fields such as graphic arts and/or corrugated packaging.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Namely, formulations such as aqueous and non-aqueous inks, paints and coatings include the above-mentioned pigment dispersions having a reduced particle size in combination with suitable binders and solvents in specified amounts. By so doing, color characteristics significantly are improved in contact printing applications such as offset lithography, flexography, gravure and screen printing applications, and especially when applied onto substrates including but not limited to plastics, non-woven fibers and textiles.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">One advantage of the present invention is the use of such pigment dispersions with a reduced particle size of a mean volume weight number (d50) particle size less than 120 nm in application such as offset lithography, flexography, gravure and screen printing. In one embodiment, the inks, coatings or paints including such pigment dispersion, exhibit viscosities greater than about 35 cps, preferably greater than 200 cps, even more preferably greater than 1,000 cps.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Another advantage of the present invention includes ink or coating formulations including low amounts of colorants such as pigments, which still exhibit similar or better color characteristics as other dispersions.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In the present invention, there is also described another embodiment with an ink employing the above-mentioned pigment, in combination with a binder and solvent. The solid binder to pigment ratio of the ink is greater than about 1.5. Moreover, the mean volume weighted number (d50) particle size of the pigment is less than 120 nm. In one embodiment, the amount of pigment is less than about 10 wt. %. In one embodiment, the viscosity is greater than or equal to 1 cps, preferably grater than 35 cps, even more preferably greater than 1,000 cps.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In the present invention, there is described a method of coloring an article with an ink. Included are articles such as, for example, paper, plastics, corrugated packaging, textiles, non-woven substrates, wall coverings, floor coverings and laminates.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Also provided is a method of coloring an article with a printing ink or coating including a pigment dispersion. The pigment dispersion has a (d50) particle size less than 120 nm. In the method, there includes a step of providing the substrate including a surface and a step of providing a printing ink or coating including a pigment dispersion with a mean particle size (d50) less than about 120 nm. Also included is a step of transferring the ink or coating onto a transfer object. The transfer object, for example, may be an offset plate, a screen mesh, stencil. The transfer object is employed to transfer the ink or coating onto a surface of the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variation can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>

The inventors also have discovered printing ink or coating compositions employing the above-mentioned pigment dispersions exhibiting improved color strength characteristics. In one embodiment, the ink is applied onto an article, such as for example, plastics, paper, corrugated packaging, non-woven fibers and textiles. In an another embodiment, these pigment dispersions or inks are used in printing applications other than Digital printing such as ink jet and xerography.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Formulations of aqueous and non-aqueous inks, paints and coatings at least include the above-mentioned pigment dispersion. The pigment dispersion has a mean volume weighted average (d50) particle size less than 120 nm. These ink or coating formulations also include a binder/vehicle in combination with a solvent/carrier. The binder and solvent are provided in sufficient amounts to ensure optimal color strength. Of the final ink and coating formulation. Specifically, it has been observed by the inventors that their solid binder to pigment ratio in the ink formulation is greater than or equal to 1.50:1. By so doing, the color strength, gloss and contrast ratio of an ink or coating is applied onto an article and exhibits improved color strength. In addition, the ink or coating formulations include very small amounts of colorants/pigments and yet still exhibit similar or better color characteristics as commercial pigment dispersions. In another embodiment, the formulations are used for printing on primary or secondary packaging.

The method includes a solid milling agent, such as an alkali-soluble, acid-soluble, or solvent-soluble polymeric material, used as milling media in the presence of a pigment dispersion of pigment particles, binder liquid carrier, and optionally, other additives. The pigment dispersion and solid milling agent are milled until sufficient particle size reduction has occurred. In a further exemplary embodiment, milling is carried out by agitation. Once the pigment particles of the premix are dispersed (i.e., particle size reduction is completed), the media and premix are separated. Separation can be conducted by any known technique including but not limited to filtration.</p>

Pigment Yellow 14 press cake at 42.2% solids (474-4480 from Sun Chemical), 9.9% JoncrylÂ® 674 resin pellets (BASF), 3.1% urea, 2.5% ammonia (28% solution), 0.2% Proxel GXL biocide (Dow), 0.1% SurfynolÂ® DF-110D defoamer, and 29.1% water. The composition of Example 1 is provided in Table 1A below. The premix was mixed on a high speed mixer for 90 minutes. The pigment content of this mixture was 30.6% with 9.9% styrene-acrylic resin. This mixture was then milled on a recirculating Netzsch Mill (LabStarÂ® 0.5 L) using 0.25 mm polystyrene media (Glen Mills) at 85% mill charge until a particle size of mv=84 nm and d50=71 nm was achieved. The mean particle size was determined using a Nanotrac Particle Size Analyzer (Microtrac, Mongomeryville, PA).</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0076">To test for color strength and color data, a bleach was prepared of this pigment dispersion (1 part dispersion to 50 parts Porter paint) and compared to a bleach prepared using a Control YCD-2004 (same formula, but a commercial dispersion milled on a PremierÂ® Mill using 0.8-1.0 mm ZrSi media). Each of the pigment dispersions in Examples 2-6 below use the same bleach/drawdown method to obtain strength and color data as provided for in Example 1.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0077">A drawdown was made using #30 Meyer rod on a Lenetta opacity card comparing Example 1 versus. the Control. The light emitted from the spectrophotometer on the drawdown and the reflectance curve was measured. The color strength is a comparative measure of the reflectance at maximum absorption of the Example versus the control. The drawdown indicated a 141% increase in strength with an adjusted DE of 2.37 and a db* of 2.15 indicating a yellower and more saturated color. By comparison, the particle size of Control YCD-2004 was mv=245 nm and d50=205 nm. The color strength data is provided in Table 1B below.</p>

      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0084">A small particle size red aqueous dispersion was prepared by taking a (blue/shade) Lithol Rubine dispersion, RFD-9587 (Sun Chemical) having a particle size of mv=234 nm and a d50 of 212 nm, and having a composition of 29.0% pigment, 11.0% resin and 60.0% water. This is a commercial dispersion manufactured on a horizontal mill utilizing 0.8-1.0 mm ceramic media. The primary application is for the aqueous flexographic ink market. To this dispersion a resin solution and water were added as follows: 80.0 grams RFD-9587, 10.0 grams of JoncrylÂ® 674 solution (30% solids) and 10.0 grams of water. This dispersion was then mixed with 75.0 grams of 100Î¼ PMMA beads (MBX-100, Nagase) serving as milling media, and subsequently mixed on a Silverson Mixer (L4RT) at 4400 RPM for 5 hours. The composition is provided in Table 5A below. This dispersion reached a particle size of mv=75 nm and d50=71 nm. The beads were separated through a 40Î¼ Whatman No. 417 filter.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0085">A bleach of this dispersion (1 part dispersion to 50 parts Porter paint) versus that of RFD-9587, and adjusted to equal pigment loading, indicated a 114% strength with an adjusted DE of 1.69 and a dC of 1.58 indicating a higher chroma. The results are provided in Table 5B below.</p>

      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0087">An aqueous ink was formulated from the dispersion prepared in Example 1. An ink was made with 33.4% dispersion (30.8% pigment and 9.9% resin), 44.4% JoncrylÂ® 138 emulsion (42.5% solids) and 22.2% water. The mixture was then shaken on a Harbil shaker to produce the final ink. The resultant binder-to-pigment ratio was 1.50 to 1 in the ink. A drawdown with a #6 Meyer rod on Leneta 3NT-1 coated paper gave an ink with a measured gloss (60Â° BYK Gardner micro-Tri-gloss) of 66 units as compared with Control YCD-2004 of 52 units.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0088">The contrast ratio is measured as follows: using a spectrophotometer, measure the color of the black bar on the Leneta 3NT-1 paper; measure the control (YCD-2004) over the black bar. This DE is defined as standard DE. Next, measure the same for the inventive ink. This is defined as sample DE. The following is the contrast ratio sample DE/standard DE.A number&lt;1 implies that the sample is more transparent than standard. The ink of Example 8 as compared with Control YCD-2004 has a contrast ratio value of 0.47. This signifies higher transparency for the ink of Example 7 relative to the control. The composition and results are provided in Table 7 below.</p>

      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0093">A UV flexographic ink was formulated from the dispersion prepared in Example 6. A UV ink was made with 56.0% dispersion, 26.0% CN2102E epoxy acrylate oligomer (Sartomer), 10.0% SR9003 diacrylate monomer (Sartomer), 4.0% IrgacureÂ® 369 (Ciba), 2.5% 4-PBZ (IGM), 1.0% ITZ (IGM) and 0.5% GenoradÂ® 16 (Rahn). The binder-to-pigment in this ink was about 6:1. An ink was made with the comparative dispersion UVD-B354 as follows: 31.0% UVD-B354, 17.0% CN2012E (Sartomer), 44.0% SR9003, 4.0% IrgacureÂ® 369 (Ciba), 2.5% 4-PBZ (IGM), 1.0% ITZ (IGM) and 0.5% GenoradÂ® 16 (Rahn). Each of these inks contain the same pigment and oligomer content after allowing for adjustment for the differing pigment contents between the two dispersions. The inks were drawndown with a #6 Meyer rod on a AG-5300 card (Byk) using a K-proofer. Colorimetric readings were performed using a Spectracolor instrument. The ink of the example reads 122% strong to the ink of UVD-B354, and it has a da*=â1.22 implying greener in shade. The composition and results are provided in Table 12 below.</p>
