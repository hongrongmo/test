      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2014-045668, filed Mar. 7, 2014; and Japanese Patent Application No. 2014-189390, filed Sep. 17, 2014, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to a curable composition that contains a polymerizable compound (A) having predetermined kinds of polymerizable functional groups and a reactive compound (B) having predetermined kinds of reactive functional groups; an adhesive formed of the curable composition; a method of producing a fiber-reinforced composite material using the curable composition; and a fiber-reinforced composite material including a matrix formed of a cured material of the curable composition and reinforced fibers.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">A curable composition containing a curable compound such as an epoxy compound, a curing agent and a curing catalyst are widely used in various applications such as an application for an adhesive, an application for sealing various electronic components, or an application for forming a matrix of a fiber-reinforced composite material.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In regard to such a curable composition, from a viewpoint of impregnation properties into a fiber base material formed of reinforced fibers at the time of producing a fiber-reinforced composite material or for ease of injection into a die at the time of sealing a minute electronic component, providing a cured material with excellent fluidity and mechanical characteristics is required.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In light of the above-described problem, for example, a curable composition that contains an alicyclic epoxy resin, a radical polymerizable monomer having a specific structure with a methacryloyloxy group and a carboxyl group, and a radical polymerization initiator in a specific ratio has been suggested (see Patent Document 1).</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The curable composition disclosed in Patent Document 1 certainly provides a cured material with excellent fluidity and mechanical characteristics. However, in order to sufficiently cure the curable composition disclosed in Patent Document 1, curing at a high temperature of approximately 170Â° C. for approximately 10 minutes or a combination of preliminary-curing at 100Â° C. or lower for several hours and curing in a temperature range of, approximately, 120Â° C. to 160Â° C. for several hours needs to be performed.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">When a curable composition is used for sealing various electronic components or for producing a fiber-reinforced composite material, the curable composition needs to be sufficiently cured at a low temperature in a short period of time from a viewpoint of reduction in the production cost or safety of an operation, but there is a problem in that the curable composition disclosed in Patent Document 1 does not satisfy the above-described condition.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Further, the curable composition is generally required to have a long pot life in which properties such as viscosity and the like are not changed even during long-term storage.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The present invention has been made in consideration of the above-described problems and an object thereof is to provide a curable composition which is capable of forming a cured material with excellent mechanical characteristics by being cured at a low temperature in a short period of time and has a long pot life; an adhesive which is formed of the curable composition; a method of producing a fiber-reinforced composite material using the curable composition; and a fiber-reinforced composite material which contains a matrix formed of the curable composition.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>

      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0204">The curable composition can be produced by uniformly mixing respective components described above at a predetermined ratio. As a mixer which can be used for producing the curable composition, a two-roll or a three-roll can be exemplified. Since the curable composition containing respective components described above is cured at a low temperature of approximately 130Â° C. in a short period of time, it is preferable that the mixing operation at the time of preparing the curable composition is performed in a temperature range of room temperature to approximately 40Â° C. In a case where the viscosity of the curable composition is sufficiently low, in order to remove insoluble foreign matters, the curable composition may be filtered using a filter having an opening with a desired size if necessary.</p>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0205">The curable composition produced in this manner provides a cured material with excellent mechanical characteristics and the pot life is long even when cured at a low temperature in a short period of time.

In addition, the above-described curable composition can be cured at a low temperature, but the curable composition can be cured at a high temperature. The curing temperature of the curable composition is not particularly limited as long as thermal decomposition of the components contained in the curable composition or volatilization or sublimation of the components other than the solvent (S) does not occur at the temperature.</p>

Any of a twisted yarn, an untwisting yarn, and a non-twisted yarn can be used for the reinforced fibers and an untwisting yarn or a non-twisting yarn is preferable in terms of formability and mechanical strength of the fiber-reinforced composite material.</p>
      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0211">The form of reinforced fibers is not particularly limited. Short fibers of the reinforced fibers may be dispersed in a matrix or long fibers of the reinforced fibers aligned in one direction or woven fabric or nonwoven fabric of the reinforced fibers may be coated with a matrix. In a case where the reinforced fibers are woven fabric, the weaving method can be freely selected from plain weave and satin weave according to the region to be used or the use thereof.</p>

The reinforced fibers may be used in combination of two or more kinds thereof. Among these reinforced fibers, carbon fibers are preferable in terms of particularly excellent strength of the fiber-reinforced composite material. As the carbon fibers, polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fibers, pitch-based carbon fibers, or rayon-based carbon fibers can be used. Among these carbon fibers, polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fibers are preferable.</p>

      <p id="p-00241-en" num="0214">The method of producing the fiber-reinforced composite material is not particularly limited. The fiber-reinforced composite material is produced by impregnating the curable composition into the reinforced fibers and curing the curable composition under a predetermined condition according to the known method. Since the above-described curable composition is cured at a low temperature in a short period of time, when the curable composition is used, the fiber-reinforced composite material can be produced at a high cycle while the energy required for curing is reduced.</p>

In addition, according to Examples 14 to 21, it is understood that the curable compositions containing the components (A), the components (B), the components (C), and the components (D) which are respectively predetermined structures can form a cured material, which is almost completely cured to the extent of not being dissolved in a solvent, by being cured at a low temperature in a short period of time and have a long pot life.</p>
