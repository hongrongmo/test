      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">Joint replacement surgeries have become routine procedures for alleviating symptoms associated with dysfunctional joint surfaces. For example, joints can be damaged by arthritis and other diseases, injuries, and the like. Arthritis and years of use may cause the joint to wear away, which causes pain, stiffness, and swelling. Joint replacement surgeries typically include replacing all or part of the joint with a prosthesis that comprises mechanical parts designed to mimic the function of a natural joint. During the procedure of knee replacement, trials are placed in the knee that are similar to the final implants. These trials may be inserted and removed one or more times during the procedure. The process of removing the trials may be difficult. In addition, one or more of the final implants may be fixated to the bone by cement or by bony ingrowth. In the event that the prosthesis (implant) needs to be removed, the removal of one or more of the mechanical parts or prosthesis (implant) may require significant force.</p>

      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Each of the first handle <b>18</b> and the second handle <b>22</b> includes a first end <b>34</b>, <b>38</b> and a second end <b>42</b>, <b>46</b>. The first handle <b>18</b> and the second handle <b>22</b> are pivotably coupled to one another by a fastener (i.e., a screw or the like) <b>50</b>, which is positioned between the first ends <b>34</b>, <b>38</b> and the second ends <b>42</b>, <b>46</b> of each handle <b>18</b>, <b>22</b>. The first handle <b>18</b> and the second handle <b>22</b> are pivotable relative to one another about a first axis <b>54</b> (see <figref>FIG. 3</figref>) defined by the fastener <b>50</b>. A portion <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> of each of the first handle <b>18</b> and the second handle <b>22</b> is arcuately shaped such that, together, the first handle <b>18</b> and the second handle <b>22</b> define a pistol grip of the device <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">With reference to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the first handle <b>18</b> includes a first surface <b>66</b> that has a contoured portion <b>70</b> covering at least a portion of the first surface <b>66</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the contoured portion <b>70</b> includes a plurality of grooves or indentations <b>74</b>. The contoured portion <b>70</b> provides an anti-slip surface that helps the surgeon grip the first handle <b>18</b>. The first handle <b>18</b> also includes an extension <b>78</b>, which aids in stabilizing the hand of the surgeon on the device during use.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">As illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the first handle <b>18</b> includes an strike plate <b>82</b> coupled thereto by a rod <b>86</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the strike plate <b>82</b> includes a force surface <b>90</b> that is a substantially square-shaped surface. In additional or alternative embodiments, the strike plate <b>82</b> may be any other suitable shape (i.e., circular, rectangular, etc.). Additionally, while in the illustrated embodiment, the first handle <b>18</b>, the strike plate <b>82</b>, and the rod <b>86</b> are integrally formed, other methods of joining (i.e., welding) may be employed to couple the first handle <b>18</b>, the strike plate <b>82</b>, and the rod <b>86</b> to one another.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The second handle <b>22</b> includes an aperture or opening <b>94</b> for receiving the fingers of the surgeon, however, the second handle <b>22</b> may be open (i.e., no aperture). In the open configuration of the second handle, the second handle <b>22</b> can includes indentations, ribs, prominences, etc. to allow for an anti-slip grip. The second handle <b>22</b> also includes a recess or channel <b>98</b> in which a pin <b>102</b> is slidably received. A link <b>106</b> is coupled to the pin <b>102</b> at one end and to a second surface <b>118</b> of the first handle <b>18</b> at a second end. When the first handle <b>18</b> and the second handle <b>22</b> are pivoted relative to one another about the fastener <b>50</b>, the pin <b>102</b> slides within the channel <b>98</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">With references to <figref>FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, each of the first gripping member <b>26</b> and the second gripping member <b>30</b> include a first end <b>114</b>, <b>118</b> and a second end <b>122</b>, <b>126</b>, respectively. The first gripping member <b>26</b> and the second gripping member <b>30</b> are pivotably coupled to one another by a fastener (i.e., a screw or the like) <b>130</b>, which is positioned between the first end <b>114</b>, <b>118</b> and the second end <b>122</b>, <b>126</b> of each gripping member <b>26</b>, <b>30</b>. The first gripping member <b>26</b> and the second gripping member <b>30</b> are pivotable relative to one another about a second axis <b>134</b> that is defined by the fastener <b>130</b>. The first axis <b>54</b> and the second axis <b>134</b> are spaced apart from one another along the longitudinal axis A but are oriented parallel to one another. Each of the first gripping member <b>26</b> and the second gripping member <b>30</b> includes a gripping or clamping surface <b>138</b>, <b>142</b>. A first channel <b>146</b> is formed in the gripping surface <b>138</b>, and a second channel <b>150</b> is formed in the gripping surface <b>142</b>. The channels <b>146</b>, <b>150</b> are partially defined by a wall at the distal ends (i.e., at the second ends <b>122</b>, <b>126</b>) of the gripping member <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> thereby defining a tooth or projection <b>154</b>, <b>158</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>, the first handle <b>18</b> is pivotably coupled to the first gripping member <b>26</b> by a fastener <b>162</b> such that the first gripping member <b>26</b> is pivotable relative to the first handle <b>18</b> about a third axis <b>166</b> (see <figref>FIG. 3</figref>). The fastener <b>162</b>, and therefore the third axis <b>166</b>, is positioned near the first end <b>114</b> of the first gripping member <b>26</b> and near the first end <b>34</b> of the first handle <b>18</b>. Further, the second axis <b>134</b> is positioned between the first end <b>114</b> and the second end <b>122</b> of the first gripping member <b>26</b>. A distance <b>170</b> between the second end <b>122</b> of the first gripping member <b>26</b> and the second axis <b>134</b> is greater than a distance <b>174</b> between the third axis <b>166</b> and the second axis <b>134</b>. In one construction, and as illustrated in the figures, the distance <b>170</b> is greater than the distance <b>174</b> thereby creating an elongated gripping member. The elongated configuration is to accommodate the size of trials or hardware the tool is being used to remove. Further, the gripping members have to open wide enough to accommodate the width of the trials or hardware being extracted and then allow for adequate clamping force for their removal. In other constructions, the distances <b>170</b> and <b>174</b> may be the same or substantially the same.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Similarly, the second handle <b>22</b> is pivotably coupled to the second gripping member <b>30</b> by a fastener <b>178</b> such that the second gripping member <b>30</b> is pivotable relative to the second handle <b>22</b> about a fourth axis <b>182</b>. The fourth axis <b>182</b> is substantially aligned with and spaced along the longitudinal axis A apart from the third axis <b>166</b>. The fastener <b>178</b>, and therefore the fourth axis <b>182</b>, is positioned near the first end <b>118</b> of the second gripping member <b>30</b> and near the first end <b>38</b> of the second handle <b>22</b>. Further, the second axis <b>134</b> is positioned between the first end <b>118</b> and the second end <b>126</b> of the second gripping member <b>30</b>. A distance <b>186</b> between the second end <b>126</b> of the second gripping member <b>30</b> and the second axis <b>134</b> is greater than a distance <b>190</b> between the fourth axis <b>182</b> and the second axis <b>134</b>. In one construction, and as illustrated in the figures, the distance <b>186</b> is greater than the distance <b>190</b> thereby creating an elongated gripping member. The elongated configuration is to accommodate the size of trials the tool or hardware is being used to remove. Further, the gripping members have to open wide enough to accommodate the width of the trials or hardware being extracted and then allow for adequate clamping force for their removal. In other constructions, the distances <b>186</b> and <b>190</b> may be the same or substantially the same.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The gripping surfaces <b>138</b>, <b>142</b> extend between the second axis <b>134</b> (i.e., where the gripping members <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> are coupled) to the second ends <b>122</b>, <b>126</b> of the first and the second gripping members <b>26</b>, <b>30</b>. Therefore, the gripping surfaces <b>138</b>, <b>142</b> are elongated. As illustrated, the first axis <b>54</b>, second axis <b>134</b>, third axis <b>166</b>, and fourth axis <b>182</b> are oriented in parallel to one another. Further, the third axis <b>166</b> and the fourth axis <b>182</b> are positioned between the first axis <b>54</b> and the second axis <b>134</b> such that pivoting motion of the handles <b>18</b>, <b>22</b> relative to one another causes the gripping members <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> to pivot about the fasteners <b>162</b>, <b>178</b>, and therefore, the third and fourth axes <b>166</b>, <b>182</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">As illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the first handle <b>18</b> and the second handle <b>22</b> are configured to pivot the first gripping member <b>26</b> and the second gripping member <b>30</b> relative to one another for gripping trials or other hardware therebetween. Moving or pivoting the first handle <b>18</b> and the second handle <b>22</b> relative to one another between a first position (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>) and second position (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>) causes the first gripping member <b>26</b> and the second gripping member <b>30</b> to pivot relative to one another between an unclamped position (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>) and a clamped position (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In particular, when the first handle <b>18</b> is moved closer to the second handle <b>22</b>, the first gripping member <b>26</b> and the second gripping member <b>30</b> move from the unclamped position to the clamped position. In doing so, the first end <b>114</b> of the first gripping member <b>26</b> and the first end <b>118</b> of the second gripping member <b>30</b> move away from one another and the second end <b>122</b> of the first gripping member <b>26</b> and the second end <b>126</b> of the second gripping member <b>114</b> move toward one another. In other words, the gripping surfaces <b>138</b>, <b>142</b> of the first gripping member <b>26</b> and the second gripping member <b>30</b>, respectively, move toward one another from the unclamped position to the clamped position. When the device <b>10</b> is in the clamped position, the channels <b>146</b>, <b>150</b> and the teeth <b>154</b>, <b>158</b> cooperate in securing the trials or other hardware that is to be extracted or removed between the first and the second gripping members <b>26</b>, <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Additionally, the length of the gripping surfaces <b>138</b>, <b>142</b> allows the surgeon to insert the device <b>10</b> deep within the body cavity to grasp orthopedic trials, prostheses, and hardware. Once the tissue or orthopedic part is secured between the first and the second gripping members <b>26</b>, <b>30</b>, the surgeon may exert a force away from the cavity to remove the orthopedic part. If the surgeon requires additional force to remove the orthopedic part, the surgeon may apply extra force (i.e., with a surgical mallet or the like) to the force surface <b>90</b> of the strike plate <b>82</b> in order to remove the orthopedic part. Therefore, the strike plate <b>82</b> may be spaced apart from the first handle <b>18</b> by any suitable distance (i.e., a length <b>194</b> of the rod <b>86</b>) that accommodates another surgical tool to provide a striking force against the force surface <b>90</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Similarly, when the first handle <b>18</b> is pivoted away from the second handle <b>22</b>, the first gripping member <b>26</b> and the second gripping member <b>30</b> move from the clamped position to the unclamped position. In doing so, the first end <b>114</b> of the first gripping member <b>26</b> and the first end <b>118</b> of the second gripping member <b>30</b> move toward one another and the second end <b>122</b> of the first gripping member <b>26</b> and the second end <b>126</b> of the second gripping member <b>114</b> move away from one another from the clamped position to the unclamped position. In other words, the gripping surfaces <b>138</b>, <b>142</b> of the first gripping member <b>26</b> and the second gripping member <b>30</b>, respectively, move away from one another.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a surgical extraction device <b>210</b> according to another embodiment of the invention. The surgical extraction device <b>210</b> of <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is similar to the surgical extraction device of <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>; therefore, like structure will be identified by like reference numbers plus â200â and only the differences will be discussed hereafter.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The surgical extraction device <b>210</b> includes a first handle <b>218</b> and a second handle <b>222</b> that are pivotably coupled to one another by a fastener <b>250</b>. A first gripping member <b>226</b> and a second gripping member <b>230</b> are pivotably coupled to one another by the fastener <b>250</b>, as well. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the first handle <b>218</b> is formed as one piece with the gripping member <b>230</b> and the second handle <b>222</b> is formed as one piece with the gripping member <b>226</b>. In other additional or alternative embodiments, each of the first and the second handles <b>218</b>, <b>222</b> and the first and the second gripping members <b>226</b>, <b>230</b> may be unique components. In either case, the fastener <b>250</b> couples the first handle <b>218</b>, the second handle <b>222</b>, the first gripping member <b>226</b>, and the second gripping member <b>230</b> together. The first handle <b>218</b> and the second handle <b>222</b> are pivotable relative to one another about an axis <b>254</b> that is defined by the fastener <b>250</b>. Similarly, the first gripping member <b>226</b> and the second gripping member <b>230</b> are pivotable relative to one another about the axis <b>254</b> that is defined by the fastener <b>250</b>. A distance <b>386</b> between the axis <b>254</b> second ends <b>322</b>, <b>326</b> of the first and the second gripping members <b>226</b>, <b>230</b> creates an elongated gripping member. The elongated configuration is to accommodate the size of trials or hardware the tool is being used to remove. Further, the gripping members have to open wide enough to accommodate the width of the trials or hardware being extracted and then allow for adequate clamping force for their removal.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Similar to the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the first handle <b>218</b> and the second handle <b>222</b> are configured to pivot the first gripping member <b>226</b> and the second gripping member <b>230</b> relative to one another for gripping trials or other hardware therebetween. Moving or pivoting the first handle <b>218</b> and the second handle <b>222</b> relative to one another between a first position and second position causes the first gripping member <b>226</b> and the second gripping member <b>230</b> to pivot relative to one another between an unclamped position and a clamped position about axis <b>254</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Thus, the invention provides, among other things, a surgical extraction device that includes a strike plate, a pistol type grip, and elongated gripping surfaces that have a channel and a tooth.
