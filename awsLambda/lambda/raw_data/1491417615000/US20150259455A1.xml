      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">Polyolefins such as high density polyethylene (HDPE) homopolymer and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) copolymer can be produced using various combinations of catalyst systems and polymerization processes. Chromium-based catalyst systems can, for example, produce olefin polymers having good extrusion processibility and polymer melt strength, typically due to their broad molecular weight distribution (MWD).</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In some end-use applications, it can be beneficial to have the processibility and melt strength similar to that of an olefin polymer produced from a chromium-based catalyst system, as well as improvements in toughness, impact strength, and environmental stress crack resistance (ESCR) at equivalent or higher polymer densities. Accordingly, it is to these ends that the present invention is directed.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify required or essential features of the claimed subject matter. Nor is this summary intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The present invention generally relates to new catalyst compositions, methods for preparing catalyst compositions, methods for using the catalyst compositions to polymerize olefins, the polymer resins produced using such catalyst compositions, and articles produced using these polymer resins. In particular, aspects of the present invention are directed to catalyst compositions employing two metallocene catalyst components. The first catalyst component can comprise an unbridged metallocene compound, for instance, an unbridged zirconium or hafnium based metallocene compound containing two cyclopentadienyl groups, two indenyl groups, or a cyclopentadienyl and an indenyl group. The second catalyst component can comprise a bridged metallocene compound, for instance, a bridged zirconium or hafnium based metallocene compound with a cyclopentadienyl group and a fluorenyl group, and with an alkenyl substituent on the bridging group and/or on the cyclopentadienyl group. Such catalyst compositions can be used to produce, for example, ethylene-based copolymers for variety of end-use applications, such as the blow molding of large parts.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The present invention also contemplates and encompasses olefin polymerization processes. Such processes can comprise contacting a catalyst composition with an olefin monomer and optionally an olefin comonomer under polymerization conditions to produce an olefin polymer. Generally, the catalyst composition employed can comprise any of the catalyst component I (unbridged) metallocene compounds, any of the catalyst component II (bridged) metallocene compounds, and any of the activators and optional co-catalysts disclosed herein. For example, organoaluminum compounds can be utilized in the catalyst compositions and/or polymerization processes.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Polymers produced from the polymerization of olefins, resulting in homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers, etc., can be used to produce various articles of manufacture. A representative and non-limiting example of an olefin polymer (e.g., an ethylene copolymer) consistent with aspects of this invention can be characterized as having the following properties: a density of greater than or equal to about 0.945 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, a high load melt index (HLMI) in a range from about 1 to about 25 g/10 min, a peak molecular weight (Mp) in a range from about 52,000 to about 132,000 g/mol, and an environmental stress crack resistance (ESCR) of at least 250 hours. Another representative and non-limiting ethylene-based polymer described herein can have a density of greater than or equal to about 0.945 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, a high load melt index (HLMI) in a range from about 1 to about 25 g/10 min, a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) in a range from about 275,000 to about 800,000 g/mol, a number-average molecular weight (Mn) in a range from about 20,000 to about 60,000 g/mol, and a ratio of Mw/Mn in a range from about 5 to about 22. These polymers, in further aspects, can be characterized by low levels of long chain branches (LCB), and/or a reverse comonomer distribution, and/or a bimodal molecular weight distribution, and/or high impact resistance, and/or excellent blow molding performance and processability.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Both the foregoing summary and the following detailed description provide examples and are explanatory only. Accordingly, the foregoing summary and the following detailed description should not be considered to be restrictive. Further, features or variations may be provided in addition to those set forth herein. For example, certain aspects and embodiments may be directed to various feature combinations and sub-combinations described in the detailed description.</p>

      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">To define more clearly the terms used herein, the following definitions are provided. Unless otherwise indicated, the following definitions are applicable to this disclosure. If a term is used in this disclosure but is not specifically defined herein, the definition from the IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd Ed (1997), can be applied, as long as that definition does not conflict with any other disclosure or definition applied herein, or render indefinite or non-enabled any claim to which that definition is applied. To the extent that any definition or usage provided by any document incorporated herein by reference conflicts with the definition or usage provided herein, the definition or usage provided herein controls.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">While compositions and methods are described herein in terms of âcomprisingâ various components or steps, the compositions and methods can also âconsist essentially ofâ or âconsist ofâ the various components or steps, unless stated otherwise. For example, a catalyst composition consistent with aspects of the present invention can comprise; alternatively, can consist essentially of; or alternatively, can consist of; (i) catalyst component I, (ii) catalyst component II, (iii) an activator, and (iv) optionally, a co-catalyst.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The terms âa,â âan,â âthe,â etc., are intended to include plural alternatives, e.g., at least one, unless otherwise specified. For instance, the disclosure of âan activator-supportâ or âa metallocene compoundâ is meant to encompass one, or mixtures or combinations of more than one, activator-support or metallocene compound, respectively, unless otherwise specified.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Generally, groups of elements are indicated using the numbering scheme indicated in the version of the periodic table of elements published in <i>Chemical and Engineering News, </i>63(5), 27, 1985. In some instances, a group of elements can be indicated using a common name assigned to the group; for example, alkali metals for Group 1 elements, alkaline earth metals for Group 2 elements, transition metals for Group 3-12 elements, and halogens or halides for Group 17 elements.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">For any particular compound disclosed herein, the general structure or name presented is also intended to encompass all structural isomers, conformational isomers, and stereoisomers that can arise from a particular set of substituents, unless indicated otherwise.

      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The term âsubstitutedâ when used to describe a group, for example, when referring to a substituted analog of a particular group, is intended to describe any non-hydrogen moiety that formally replaces a hydrogen in that group, and is intended to be non-limiting. A group or groups can also be referred to herein as âunsubstitutedâ or by equivalent terms such as ânon-substituted,â which refers to the original group in which a non-hydrogen moiety does not replace a hydrogen within that group. Unless otherwise specified, âsubstitutedâ is intended to be non-limiting and include inorganic substituents or organic substituents as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The term âhydrocarbonâ whenever used in this specification and claims refers to a compound containing only carbon and hydrogen. Other identifiers can be utilized to indicate the presence of particular groups in the hydrocarbon (e.g., halogenated hydrocarbon indicates the presence of one or more halogen atoms replacing an equivalent number of hydrogen atoms in the hydrocarbon). The term âhydrocarbyl groupâ is used herein in accordance with the definition specified by IUPAC: a univalent group formed by removing a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon (that is, a group containing only carbon and hydrogen). Non-limiting examples of hydrocarbyl groups include alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, and aralkyl groups, amongst other groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The term âpolymerâ is used herein generically to include olefin homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers, and so forth. A copolymer is derived from an olefin monomer and one olefin comonomer, while a terpolymer is derived from an olefin monomer and two olefin comonomers. Accordingly, âpolymerâ encompasses copolymers, terpolymers, etc., derived from any olefin monomer and comonomer(s) disclosed herein. Similarly, an ethylene polymer would include ethylene homopolymers, ethylene copolymers, ethylene terpolymers, and the like. As an example, an olefin copolymer, such as an ethylene copolymer, can be derived from ethylene and a comonomer, such as 1-butene, 1-hexene, or 1-octene. If the monomer and comonomer were ethylene and 1-hexene, respectively, the resulting polymer can be categorized an as ethylene/1-hexene copolymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In like manner, the scope of the term âpolymerizationâ includes homopolymerization, copolymerization, terpolymerization, etc. Therefore, a copolymerization process can involve contacting one olefin monomer (e.g., ethylene) and one olefin comonomer (e.g., 1-hexene) to produce a copolymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The term âco-catalystâ is used generally herein to refer to compounds such as aluminoxane compounds, organoboron or organoborate compounds, ionizing ionic compounds, organoaluminum compounds, organozinc compounds, organomagnesium compounds, organolithium compounds, and the like, that can constitute one component of a catalyst composition, when used, for example, in addition to an activator-support. The term âco-catalystâ is used regardless of the actual function of the compound or any chemical mechanism by which the compound may operate.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The terms âchemically-treated solid oxide,â âtreated solid oxide compound,â and the like, are used herein to indicate a solid, inorganic oxide of relatively high porosity, which can exhibit Lewis acidic or BrÃ¸nsted acidic behavior, and which has been treated with an electron-withdrawing component, typically an anion, and which is calcined. The electron-withdrawing component is typically an electron-withdrawing anion source compound. Thus, the chemically-treated solid oxide can comprise a calcined contact product of at least one solid oxide with at least one electron-withdrawing anion source compound. Typically, the chemically-treated solid oxide comprises at least one acidic solid oxide compound. The âactivator-supportâ of the present invention can be a chemically-treated solid oxide. The terms âsupportâ and âactivator-supportâ are not used to imply these components are inert, and such components should not be construed as an inert component of the catalyst composition. The term âactivator,â as used herein, refers generally to a substance that is capable of converting a metallocene component into a catalyst that can polymerize olefins, or converting a contact product of a metallocene component and a component that provides an activatable ligand (e.g., an alkyl, a hydride) to the metallocene, when the metallocene compound does not already comprise such a ligand, into a catalyst that can polymerize olefins. This term is used regardless of the actual activating mechanism. Illustrative activators include activator-supports, aluminoxanes, organoboron or organoborate compounds, ionizing ionic compounds, and the like. Aluminoxanes, organoboron or organoborate compounds, and ionizing ionic compounds generally are referred to as activators if used in a catalyst composition in which an activator-support is not present. If the catalyst composition contains an activator-support, then the aluminoxane, organoboron or organoborate, and ionizing ionic materials are typically referred to as co-catalysts.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The term âmetalloceneâ as used herein describes compounds comprising at least one Î·<sup>3 </sup>to Î·<sup>5</sup>-cycloalkadienyl-type moiety, wherein Î·<sup>3 </sup>to Î·<sup>5</sup>-cycloalkadienyl moieties include cyclopentadienyl ligands, indenyl ligands, fluorenyl ligands, and the like, including partially saturated or substituted derivatives or analogs of any of these. Possible substituents on these ligands may include H, therefore this invention comprises ligands such as tetrahydroindenyl, tetrahydrofluorenyl, octahydrofluorenyl, partially saturated indenyl, partially saturated fluorenyl, substituted partially saturated indenyl, substituted partially saturated fluorenyl, and the like. In some contexts, the metallocene is referred to simply as the âcatalyst,â in much the same way the term âco-catalystâ is used herein to refer to, for example, an organoaluminum compound.</p>

For example, the components can be contacted by blending or mixing. Further, contacting of any component can occur in the presence or absence of any other component of the compositions described herein. Combining additional materials or components can be done by any suitable method. Further, the term âcontact productâ includes mixtures, blends, solutions, slurries, reaction products, and the like, or combinations thereof. Although âcontact productâ can include reaction products, it is not required for the respective components to react with one another. Similarly, the term âcontactingâ is used herein to refer to materials which can be blended, mixed, slurried, dissolved, reacted, treated, or otherwise contacted in some other manner.</p>

Generally, continuous processes can comprise the continuous introduction of monomer/comonomer, a catalyst, and a diluent into a polymerization reactor and the continuous removal from this reactor of a suspension comprising polymer particles and the diluent. Reactor effluent can be flashed to remove the solid polymer from the liquids that comprise the diluent, monomer and/or comonomer. Various technologies can be used for this separation step including, but not limited to, flashing that can include any combination of heat addition and pressure reduction, separation by cyclonic action in either a cyclone or hydrocyclone, or separation by centrifugation.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0120">A typical slurry polymerization process (also known as the particle form process) is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,248,179, 4,501,885, 5,565,175, 5,575,979, 6,239,235, 6,262,191, and 6,833,415, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>

Examples of suitable diluents include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbons such as propane, cyclohexane, isobutane, n-butane, n-pentane, isopentane, neopentane, and n-hexane. Some loop polymerization reactions can occur under bulk conditions where no diluent is used. An example is polymerization of propylene monomer as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,314, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0122">According to yet another aspect of this invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise at least one gas phase reactor. Such systems can employ a continuous recycle stream containing one or more monomers continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of the catalyst under polymerization conditions. A recycle stream can be withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product can be withdrawn from the reactor and new or fresh monomer can be added to replace the polymerized monomer. Such gas phase reactors can comprise a process for multi-step gas-phase polymerization of olefins, in which olefins are polymerized in the gaseous phase in at least two independent gas-phase polymerization zones while feeding a catalyst-containing polymer formed in a first polymerization zone to a second polymerization zone. One type of gas phase reactor is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,352,749, 4,588,790, and 5,436,304, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0123">According to still another aspect of the invention, a high pressure polymerization reactor can comprise a tubular reactor or an autoclave reactor. Tubular reactors can have several zones where fresh monomer, initiators, or catalysts are added. Monomer can be entrained in an inert gaseous stream and introduced at one zone of the reactor. Initiators, catalysts, and/or catalyst components can be entrained in a gaseous stream and introduced at another zone of the reactor. The gas streams can be intermixed for polymerization. Heat and pressure can be employed appropriately to obtain optimal polymerization reaction conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0124">According to yet another aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise a solution polymerization reactor wherein the monomer (and comonomer, if used) are contacted with the catalyst composition by suitable stirring or other means. A carrier comprising an inert organic diluent or excess monomer can be employed. If desired, the monomer/comonomer can be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalytic reaction product, in the presence or absence of liquid material. The polymerization zone is maintained at temperatures and pressures that will result in the formation of a solution of the polymer in a reaction medium. Agitation can be employed to obtain better temperature control and to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures throughout the polymerization zone. Adequate means are utilized for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0125">Polymerization reactor systems suitable for the present invention can further comprise any combination of at least one raw material feed system, at least one feed system for catalyst or catalyst components, and/or at least one polymer recovery system. Suitable reactor systems for the present invention can further comprise systems for feedstock purification, catalyst storage and preparation, extrusion, reactor cooling, polymer recovery, fractionation, recycle, storage, loadout, laboratory analysis, and process control.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0126">Polymerization conditions that are controlled for efficiency and to provide desired polymer properties can include temperature, pressure, and the concentrations of various reactants. Polymerization temperature can affect catalyst productivity, polymer molecular weight, and molecular weight distribution. A suitable polymerization temperature can be any temperature below the de-polymerization temperature according to the Gibbs Free energy equation. Typically, this includes from about 60Â° C. to about 280Â° C., for example, or from about 60Â° C. to about 120Â° C., depending upon the type of polymerization reactor(s). In some reactor systems, the polymerization temperature generally can fall within a range from about 70Â° C. to about 100Â° C., or from about 75Â° C. to about 95Â° C. Various polymerization conditions can be held substantially constant, for example, for the production of a particular grade of olefin polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0127">Suitable pressures will also vary according to the reactor and polymerization type. The pressure for liquid phase polymerizations in a loop reactor is typically less than 1000 psig (6.9 MPa). Pressure for gas phase polymerization is usually at about 200 to 500 psig (1.4 MPa to 3.4 MPa). High pressure polymerization in tubular or autoclave reactors is generally run at about 20,000 to 75,000 psig (138 to 517 MPa). Polymerization reactors can also be operated in a supercritical region occurring at generally higher temperatures and pressures. Operation above the critical point of a pressure/temperature diagram (supercritical phase) may offer advantages.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0128">Aspects of this invention are directed to olefin polymerization processes comprising contacting a catalyst composition with an olefin monomer and an optional olefin comonomer under polymerization conditions to produce an olefin polymer. The olefin polymer (e.g., ethylene copolymer) produced by the process can have any of the polymer properties disclosed herein, for example, a density of greater than or equal to about 0.945 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and/or a high load melt index (HLMI) in a range from about 1 to about 25 g/10 min, and/or a peak molecular weight (Mp) in a range from about 52,000 to about 132,000 g/mol, and/or an environmental stress crack resistance (ESCR) of at least 250 hours, and/or a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) in a range from about 275,000 to about 800,000 g/mol, and/or a number-average molecular weight (Mn) in a range from about 20,000 to about 60,000 g/mol, and/or a ratio of Mw/Mn in a range from about 5 to about 22, and/or low levels of long chain branches (LCB), and/or a reverse comonomer distribution, and/or a bimodal molecular weight distribution.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0129">Aspects of this invention also are directed to olefin polymerization processes conducted in the absence of added hydrogen. An olefin polymerization process of this invention can comprise contacting a catalyst composition with an olefin monomer and optionally an olefin comonomer in a polymerization reactor system under polymerization conditions to produce an olefin polymer, wherein the catalyst composition can comprise catalyst component I, catalyst component II, an activator, and an optional co-catalyst, and wherein the polymerization process is conducted in the absence of added hydrogen (no hydrogen is added to the polymerization reactor system). As one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize, hydrogen can be generated in-situ by metallocene catalyst compositions in various olefin polymerization processes, and the amount generated can vary depending upon the specific catalyst composition and metallocene compound(s) employed, the type of polymerization process used, the polymerization reaction conditions utilized, and so forth.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0130">In other aspects, it may be desirable to conduct the polymerization process in the presence of a certain amount of added hydrogen. Accordingly, an olefin polymerization process of this invention can comprise contacting a catalyst composition with an olefin monomer and optionally an olefin comonomer in a polymerization reactor system under polymerization conditions to produce an olefin polymer, wherein the catalyst composition comprises catalyst component I, catalyst component II, an activator, and an optional co-catalyst, and wherein the polymerization process is conducted in the presence of added hydrogen (hydrogen is added to the polymerization reactor system). For example, the ratio of hydrogen to the olefin monomer in the polymerization process can be controlled, often by the feed ratio of hydrogen to the olefin monomer entering the reactor. The added hydrogen to olefin monomer ratio in the process can be controlled at a weight ratio which falls within a range from about 25 ppm to about 1500 ppm, from about 50 to about 1000 ppm, or from about 100 ppm to about 750 ppm.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0131">In some aspects of this invention, the feed or reactant ratio of hydrogen to olefin monomer can be maintained substantially constant during the polymerization run for a particular polymer grade. That is, the hydrogen:olefin monomer ratio can be selected at a particular ratio within a range from about 5 ppm up to about 1000 ppm or so, and maintained at the ratio to within about +/â25% during the polymerization run. For instance, if the target ratio is 100 ppm, then maintaining the hydrogen:olefin monomer ratio substantially constant would entail maintaining the feed ratio between about 75 ppm and about 125 ppm. Further, the addition of comonomer (or comonomers) can be, and generally is, substantially constant throughout the polymerization run for a particular polymer grade.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0132">However, in other aspects, it is contemplated that monomer, comonomer (or comonomers), and/or hydrogen can be periodically pulsed to the reactor, for instance, in a manner similar to that employed in U.S. Pat.

      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0160">Melt index (MI, g/10 min) was determined in accordance with ASTM D1238 at 190Â° C. with a 2,160 gram weight, and high load melt index (HLMI, g/10 min) was determined in accordance with ASTM D1238 at 190Â° C. with a 21,600 gram weight. Polymer density was determined in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm<sup>3</sup>) on a compression molded sample, cooled at about 15Â° C. per hour, and conditioned for about 40 hours at room temperature in accordance with ASTM D1505 and ASTM D4703. ESCR was determined in accordance with ASTM D1693, condition B, with 10% igepal. Tensile Impact was determined in accordance with ASTM D1822, and Charpy Impact was determined in accordance with ISO 179-1.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0161">Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions were obtained using a PL-GPC 220 (Polymer Labs, an Agilent Company) system equipped with a IR4 detector (Polymer Char, Spain) and three Styragel HMW-6E GPC columns (Waters, MA) running at 145Â° C. The flow rate of the mobile phase 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) containing 0.5 g/L 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) was set at 1 mL/min, and polymer solution concentrations were in the range of 1.0-1.5 mg/mL, depending on the molecular weight. Sample preparation was conducted at 150Â° C. for nominally 4 hr with occasional and gentle agitation, before the solutions were transferred to sample vials for injection. An injection volume of about 200 Î¼L was used. The integral calibration method was used to deduce molecular weights and molecular weight distributions using a Chevron Phillips Chemical Company's HDPE polyethylene resin, MARLEXÂ® BHB5003, as the broad standard. The integral table of the broad standard was pre-determined in a separate experiment with SEC-MALS. Mn is the number-average molecular weight, Mw is the weight-average molecular weight, Mz is the z-average molecular weight, My is the viscosity-average molecular weight, and Mp is the peak molecular weight (location, in molecular weight, of the highest point of the molecular weight distribution curve).</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0162">Melt rheological characterizations were performed as follows. Small-strain (10%) oscillatory shear measurements were performed on a Rheometrics Scientific, Inc. ARES rheometer using parallel-plate geometry. All rheological tests were performed at 190Â° C. The complex viscosity |Î·*| versus frequency (Ï) data were then curve fitted using the modified three parameter Carreau-Yasuda (CY) empirical model to obtain the zero shear viscosityâÎ·<sub>0</sub>, characteristic viscous relaxation timeâÏ<sub>Î·</sub>, and the breadth parameterâa. The simplified Carreau-Yasuda (CY) empirical model is as follows.</p>

      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0170">A creep adjustment was used to extend the low frequency range of rheological characterization to 10<sup>â4 </sup>sec<sup>â1</sup>. In the creep test, a constant shear stress Ï<sub>0 </sub>was applied to the specimen and the shear strain Î³ was recorded as a function of creep time t. Although the time-dependent data generated by the creep and creep recovery tests look different from the frequency-dependent data measured in the dynamic frequency sweep test, as long as the measurements are performed in the linear viscoelastic regime, these two experimental data sets contain the same rheological information, so that the time-dependent creep compliance data can be transformed into the frequency-dependent dynamic data, and thus the long time creep measurement can supplement the low frequency data of the dynamic frequency sweep measurement.</p>

      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0175">For reliable conversion of the time-dependent creep data into the frequency-dependent dynamic data, the frequency range needs to be limited by the testing time of the creep measurement. If it is possible to obtain precise experimental data over the entire range of creep time until the creep compliance reaches the steady state, the exact function of retardation spectra over the entire range of time scale also can be calculated. However, it is often not practical to obtain such data for high molecular weight polymers, which have very long relaxation times. The creep data only contain information within a limited range of time, so that the frequency range is limited by the duration time t<sub>N </sub>of the creep test, i.e., valid information for frequencies is in the range of Ï&gt;t<sub>N</sub><sup>â1</sup>, and the extrapolated data outside this frequency range can be influenced by artifacts of the fittings.</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0176">For the rheological measurements involving a creep adjustment, the polymer samples were compression molded at 182Â° C. for a total of 3 min. The samples were allowed to melt at a relatively low pressure for 1 min and then subjected to a high molding pressure for an additional 2 min. The molded samples were then quenched in a room temperature press, and then 25.4 mm diameter disks were stamped out of the molded slabs for the measurement in the rotational rheometer. The measurements were performed in parallel plates of 25 mm diameter at 190Â° C. using a controlled-stress rheometer equipped with an air bearing system (Physica MCR-500, Anton Paar). The test chamber of the rheometer was purged with nitrogen to minimize oxidative degradation. After thermal equilibration, the specimens were squeezed between the plates to a 1.6 mm thickness, and the excess was trimmed A total of 8 min elapsed between the time the sample was inserted and the time the test was started. For the dynamic frequency sweep measurement, small-strain (1Ë10%) oscillatory shear in the linear viscoelastic regime was applied at angular frequencies from 0.0316 to 316 sec<sup>â1</sup>. The creep test was performed for 10,200 sec (170 min) to limit the overall testing time within 4 hr, since sample throughput and thermal stability were concerns. By converting the time dependent creep data to frequency dependent dynamic data, the low frequency range was extended down to 10<sup>â4 </sup>rad/sec, two orders of magnitude lower than the frequency range of the dynamic test. The complex viscosity (|Î·*|) versus frequency (Ï) data were curve fitted using the Carreau-Yasuda model.</p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0177">One of the major concerns in performing the creep test, and indeed any long time scale measurement, was that the sample does not appreciably change during the measurement, which may take several hours to perform. If a polymer sample is heated for long time period without proper thermal stabilization (e.g., antioxidants), changes in the polymer can occur that can have a significant effect on the rheological behavior of the polymer and its characterization. Polymers which are being tested should have thermal stability for at least 4-5 hr at 190Â° C. under nitrogen; for example, ethylene polymers containing at least 0.4 wt. % of antioxidants were found to be stable enough to obtain valid creep adjustment data.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0178">For the rheological measurement in the parallel plates, the specimen was squeezed between the plates to a 1.6 mm thickness, and then the excess was trimmed. When the sample was trimmed with large forces on one direction, some residual stress was generated to cause the strain to drift. Therefore, performing the creep test right after sample trimming should be avoided, because the residual stress can affect the subsequent creep measurement, particularly for the highly viscoelastic resins having long relaxation times. If the applied stress of the creep test is not large enough, the resulting strain can be so small that the creep results can be influenced by the artifact of the strain drifting. In order to minimize this effect, samples were trimmed as gently as possible, and the creep test was conducted after 2000 sec of waiting time, in order to allow relaxation of any residual stress.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0179">The appropriate magnitude of applied stress Ï<sub>0 </sub>is important for reliable creep data. The stress Ï<sub>0 </sub>must be sufficiently small such that the strain will stay within the linear viscoelastic regime, and it must be sufficiently large such that the strain signal is strong enough to provide satisfactory resolution of data for good precision. Although not limited thereto, a suitable applied stress was equal to the complex modulus |G*| at a frequency of 0.01 rad/sec multiplied by 0.04.</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0180">SEC-MALS combines the methods of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with multi-angle light scattering (MALS) detection. A DAWN EOS 18-angle light scattering photometer (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, Calif.) was attached to a PL-210 SEC system (Polymer Labs, now Agilent) or a Waters 150 CV Plus system (Milford, Mass.) through a hot transfer line, thermally controlled at the same temperature as the SEC columns and its differential refractive index (DRI) detector (145Â° C.). At a flow rate setting of 0.7 mL/min, the mobile phase, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB), was eluted through three, 7.5 mmÃ300 mm, 20 Î¼m Mixed A-LS columns (Polymer Labs, now Agilent). Polyethylene (PE) solutions with concentrations of Ë1.2 mg/mL, depending on samples, were prepared at 150Â° C. for 4 hr before being transferred to the SEC injection vials sitting in a carousel heated at 145Â° C. For polymers of higher molecular weight, longer heating times were necessary in order to obtain true homogeneous solutions. In addition to acquiring a concentration chromatogram, seventeen light-scattering chromatograms at different angles were also acquired for each injection using Wyatt's AstraÂ® software. At each chromatographic slice, both the absolute molecular weight (M) and root mean square (RMS) radius, also known as radius of gyration (Rg) were obtained from a Debye plot's intercept and slope, respectively. Methods for this process are detailed in Wyatt, P. J., <i>Anal. Chim. Acta, </i>272, 1 (1993), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0181">The Zimm-Stockmayer approach was used to determine the amount of LCB. Since SEC-MALS measures M and Rg at each slice of a chromatogram simultaneously, the branching indices, g<sub>M</sub>, as a function of M could be determined at each slice directly by determining the ratio of the mean square Rg of branched molecules to that of linear ones, at the same M, as shown in following equation (subscripts br and lin represent branched and linear polymers, respectively).</p>

      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0185">Short chain branch (SCB) content and short chain branching distribution (SCBD) across the molecular weight distribution can be determined via an IR5-detected GPC system (IR5-GPC), wherein the GPC system is a PL220 GPC/SEC system (Polymer Labs, an Agilent company) equipped with three Styragel HMW-6E columns (Waters, MA) for polymer separation. A thermoelectric-cooled IR5 MCT detector (IR5) (Polymer Char, Spain) is connected to the GPC columns via a hot-transfer line. Chromatographic data are obtained from two output ports of the IR5 detector. First, the analog signal goes from the analog output port to a digitizer before connecting to Computer âAâ for molecular weight determinations via the Cirrus software (Polymer Labs, now an Agilent Company) and the integral calibration method using a broad MWD HDPE Marlexâ¢ BHB5003 resin (Chevron Phillips Chemical) as the broad molecular weight standard. The digital signals, on the other hand, go via a USB cable directly to Computer âBâ where they are collected by a LabView data collection software provided by Polymer Char. Chromatographic conditions are set as follows: column oven temperature of 145Â° C.; flowrate of 1 mL/min; injection volume of 0.4 mL; and polymer concentration of about 2 mg/mL, depending on sample molecular weight. The temperatures for both the hot-transfer line and IR5 detector sample cell are set at 150Â° C., while the temperature of the electronics of the IR5 detector is set at 60Â° C. Short chain branching content is determined via an in-house method using the intensity ratio of CH<sub>3 </sub>(I<sub>CH3</sub>) to CH<sub>2 </sub>(I<sub>CH2</sub>) coupled with a calibration curve. The calibration curve is a plot of SCB content (x<sub>SCB</sub>) as a function of the intensity ratio of I<sub>CH3</sub>/I<sub>CH2</sub>. To obtain a calibration curve, a group of polyethylene resins (no less than 5) of SCB level ranging from zero to ca. 32 SCB/1,000 total carbons (SCB Standards) is used. All these SCB Standards have known SCB levels and flat SCBD profiles pre-determined separately by NMR and the solvent-gradient fractionation coupled with NMR (SGF-NMR) methods. Using SCB calibration curves thus established, profiles of short chain branching distribution across the molecular weight distribution are obtained for resins fractionated by the IR5-GPC system under exactly the same chromatographic conditions as for these SCB standards. A relationship between the intensity ratio and the elution volume is converted into SCB distribution as a function of MWD using a predetermined SCB calibration curve (i.e., intensity ratio of I<sub>CH3</sub>/I<sub>CH2 </sub>vs. SCB content) and MW calibration curve (i.e., molecular weight vs. elution time) to convert the intensity ratio of I<sub>CH3</sub>/I<sub>CH2 </sub>and the elution time into SCB content and the molecular weight, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0186">Blow molding evaluations of Examples 1-9 were performed on a Kautex KB-25 blow molding machine with the following specifications. These particular equipment and processing conditions were chosen because the blow molding performance and properties so obtained are typically representative of those obtained from larger, commercial scale blow molding operations. The extruder screw diameter was 80 mm, the L/D Ratio was 20:1, the drive motor was a 60 HP DC drive, and the maximum plasticizing capacity was about 330 lb polyethylene per hr. The extruder was equipped with a dynicso pressure indicator, three heating zones with air cooling, and a liquid cooled, grooved liner in the feed zone for processing high molecular weight polyethylene pellet and powder resins.</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0187">The accumulator head (FIFO Design) had a maximum shot capacity of 8.5 lb, a die bushing diameter maximum and minimum of 8â³ and 2â³ (respectively), where 2â³ thru 3Â½â³ is converging, and 4â³ thru 8â³ is diverging. The blow molding machine was also equipped with a 100 point Hunkar programmer.</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0188">For Examples 1-9, all extruder and head zones were set at 405Â° F. The mold was a 9-gallon bottle (Fremont Plastics Mold), and 4.5â³ diverging die head with a 30 degree land angle was used. A constant extrusion pressure was used. The mold temperature was 50-60Â° F. The timer settings were a 0.5 sec blow delay, a 0 sec preblow, and a 0 sec mold close delay. Air pressure was 90 psig. The minimum wall thickness of the parts was in the 45-50 mil range, and the die gap was 0.196â³. Parts were produced at an extruder speed of 30 RPM and a blow time of 90 sec.</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0189">The weight of the bottle produced (part weight) was recorded, and the width of the flashing at the bottom of the bottle (layflat bottom) was measured. Die swell (parison size versus die size) and weight swell (change in part weight at constant die gap and parison speed) were determined. The melt strengths of the polymers were compared via a hang time test using a 0.089â³ die gap and 20 RPM extruder speed. A parison was extruded and allowed to hang; the extruder speed was turned to zero while the parison was hanging. The time from the end of the shot to the time the parison tore away from the bushing was recorded as the hang time.</p>
      <p id="p-00203-en" num="0190">Fluorided silica-coated alumina activator-supports used in Examples 2-8 were prepared as follows. Bohemite was obtained from W.R. Grace &amp; Company under the designation âAlumina Aâ and having a surface area of about 300 m<sup>2</sup>/g, a pore volume of about 1.3 mL/g, and an average particle size of about 100 microns. The alumina was first calcined in dry air at about 600Â° C. for approximately 6 hours, cooled to ambient temperature, and then contacted with tetraethylorthosilicate in isopropanol to equal 25 wt. % SiO<sub>2</sub>. After drying, the silica-coated alumina was calcined at 600Â° C. for 3 hours. Fluorided silica-coated alumina (7 wt. % F) was prepared by impregnating the calcined silica-coated alumina with an ammonium bifluoride solution in methanol, drying, and then calcining for 3 hours at 600Â° C. in dry air. Afterward, the fluorided silica-coated alumina was collected and stored under dry nitrogen, and was used without exposure to the atmosphere.</p>
      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0191">Pilot plant polymerizations were conducted in a 23-gallon slurry loop reactor at a production rate of approximately 33 pounds of polymer per hour. Polymerization runs were carried out under continuous particle form process conditions in a loop reactor (also referred to as a slurry process) by contacting a dual metallocene solution in isobutane, an organoaluminum solution (triisobutylaluminum, TIBA), and an activator-support (fluorided silica-coated alumina) in a 2 L stirred autoclave with continuous output to the loop reactor. The TIBA and dual metallocene solutions were fed as separate streams into a tee upstream of the autoclave where they contacted each other. The activator-support was flushed with isobutane into a tee between the aforementioned tee and the autoclave, contacting the organoaluminum/metallocene mixture just before entering the autoclave. The isobutane flush used to transport the activator-support into the autoclave was set at a rate that would result in a residence time of approximately 25 minutes in the autoclave. The total flow from the autoclave then entered the loop reactor.</p>
      <p id="p-00205-en" num="0192">Ethylene used was polymerization grade ethylene which was purified through a column of alumina (activated at 250Â° C. in nitrogen). 1-Hexene was polymerization grade 1-hexene (obtained from Chevron Phillips Chemical Company) which was purified by nitrogen purging and storage over 13-X molecular sieve activated at 250Â° C. (482Â° F.) in nitrogen. The loop reactor was a liquid full, 15.2 cm diameter, loop reactor, having a volume of 23 gallons (87 liters). Liquid isobutane was used as the diluent. Hydrogen was added at about 1-2 mlb/hr to regulate the molecular weight and/or HLMI of the polymer product. The isobutane was polymerization grade isobutane (obtained from Chevron Phillips Chemical Company) that was further purified by distillation and subsequently passed through a column of alumina (activated at 250Â° C. in nitrogen).</p>
      <p id="p-00206-en" num="0193">Reactor conditions included a reactor pressure around 590 psig, a mol % ethylene of 11-13% (based on isobutane diluent), and a polymerization temperature of 90-91Â° C. Also, the reactor was operated to have a residence time of about 1.25 hr. Metallocene concentrations in the reactor were within a range of about 1.4 to 2 parts per million (ppm) by weight of the diluent in the polymerization reactor. The activator-support (fluorided silica-coated alumina) was fed to the reactor at the rate of approximately 0.2-0.3 lb per hour. Polymer was removed from the reactor at the rate of about 33 lb/hr and recovered in a flash chamber. A Vulcan dryer was used to dry the polymer under nitrogen at about 60-80Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0194">Co-catalyst TIBA was obtained as a one molar solution in heptane, but was further diluted to 1 weight percent.

Unexpectedly, however, the ESCR and impact (Charpy and Tensile) properties of Examples 2-8 were far superior to those of Examples 1 and 9; for instance, the ESCR performance was at least 10 times better. Hence, the polymers described herein can provide improved toughness, impact strength, and ESCR at an equivalent (or higher) density and/or HLMI, as compared to chromium-based resins.</p>
      <p id="p-00215-en" num="0201">The test results in Table V indicate that the polymers of Examples 2-8, unexpectedly, processed similarly to those of the chromium-based polymers of Examples 1 and 9, for example, with similar hang time, part weight, and layflat bottom results in representative blow molding experiments. Using Example 1 as a benchmark, the polymers of Examples 2-8 also had surprisingly similar die swell and weight swell. These results confirm the chromium-like processability of the polymers of Examples 2-8 under commercial blow molding conditions.</p>
