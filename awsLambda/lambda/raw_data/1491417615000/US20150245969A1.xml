      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0193">A patient support apparatus <b>10</b> for supporting a patient during surgery is shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The patient support apparatus <b>10</b> illustratively includes a foundation frame <b>12</b> and a patient support top <b>14</b>. The foundation frame <b>12</b> rests on a floor <b>16</b> and is configured to suspend the support top <b>14</b> in a number of different positions above the floor <b>16</b>. Thus, a patient undergoing surgery can be moved with the support top <b>14</b> to a number of different positions and orientations depending on the particular surgical operation to be performed on the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0194">The foundation frame <b>12</b> includes a first column <b>24</b>, a second column <b>26</b>, an extension <b>28</b>, and a control system <b>30</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. In the illustrative embodiment, the first column <b>24</b> is a head-end column and the second column <b>26</b> is a foot-end column. The support top <b>14</b> is coupled to the foundation frame <b>12</b> between the columns <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> via yoke brackets <b>20</b>. The support top <b>14</b> and the yoke brackets <b>20</b> are configured to rotate relative to the foundation frame <b>12</b> about a pivot axis <b>22</b> as suggested by arrow <b>23</b> in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The pivot axis <b>22</b> extends parallel to, and is spaced apart from, the length of the support top <b>14</b>. Thus, a patient can be rotated prior to or during a surgical operation.</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0195">Each column <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> includes a base <b>31</b> and an upright <b>32</b> extending up from the base <b>31</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. Each base <b>31</b> includes a horizontal top plate <b>51</b>, a vertical lower plate <b>53</b> extending down from the horizontal plate <b>51</b>, and a cover <b>55</b> coupled the top plate <b>51</b> to house the lower plate <b>53</b>. Each upright <b>32</b> includes a lower section <b>34</b> and an upper section <b>36</b> that is movable vertically up and down along the lower section <b>34</b> as suggested by arrow <b>38</b> to raise and lower each end of the support top <b>14</b>. Thus, a patient can be raised, lowered, or inclined prior to or during a surgical operation at the discretion of a surgeon.</p>
