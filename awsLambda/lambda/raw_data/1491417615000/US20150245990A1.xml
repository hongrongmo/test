      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0025">In this detailed description, the cell regenerative juice developed to be used in place of aqua and distilled water in the cosmetics field and the method of obtaining this juice is disclosed for illustration purposes without forming any limiting effect.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0026">The invention relates to cell regenerative juice obtained from olive seed ash to be used in place of aqua and distilled water in the cosmetics sector and to the method of obtaining this juice. Below, certain characteristics and benefits of olive seed are briefly given.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">Olive Seed</heading>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0027">Olive trees are the most durable trees in the world. Their long life is mostly related to the production of a substance called “oleuropein”, which gives them resistance against sickness and pests.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0028">Oleuropein found in all parts of the olive tree and having a hot-bitter taste is removed during processing of olive. “Elenolic acid” found in oleuropein and “calcium elenolate”, which is a derivative of oleuropein has the characteristic of avoiding various groups of microorganisms.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0029">Just like grape seed, olive seed also comprises antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, and anti-inflammatory agents. Substances that render olive oil different from other oils are found in olive seed in the densest state. If both ends of an olive seed are lightly rasped, it can be seen that the inner part of the seed is hollow and it comprises quite dense oil. Concentration of these substances in the seed reaches up to 80%. Olive seeds can also be consumed after milling.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0030">Olive seed is the easiest food to digest. Digestive juice decomposes olive seed in a very short time and obtains pure, healing olive oil and the remaining pulp repairs and eases the bowels. Researches about the subject have been carried on since 1985.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0031">People with acid indigestion say that they feel relieved after eating olive seed. It is also known that olive seed reduces the risk of formation of carcinogenic cell in internal organs. People eating olive seed do not have hemorrhoid problem. It prevents constipation and hemorrhoid bleeding. It is also good for ulcer, gastritis, indigestion etc. stomach problems. It regulates bowels and gastrointestinal tract and heals bowel inflammation. It prevents prostate formation. It prevents hypertension. It eliminates liver inflammation. It prevents arteriosclerosis and infarction. It balances cholesterol. It is good for patients having diabetes.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0032">Olive is used and known for centuries and has benefit in every sense. However, up until today, obtaining juice from olive seed ash and using this juice in the cosmetics field hasn't been considered. Juice with ash has been used as cleaner since ancient times. However, especially incineration of olive seed and method of obtaining water/juice from this ash hasn't been applied.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0033">The method of obtaining cell regenerative juice according to the invention comprises the operation steps of: <ul id="ul-00003-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00004-en" list-style="none"><li>Converting olive seed into ash,</li><li>boiling the ash by mixing with water, and</li><li>Incubation following the boiling operation, and</li><li>Separation of the water and the ash.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0038">Olive seed is first incinerated in a closed or open medium like oven. Seeds are completely brought into ash form as a result of incineration. The ash obtained from olive seed is taken into a container and water is added.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0039">5 liters of normal drinking water is added to about 500-1000 g of ash, although the ratio may change according to the cosmetic formulation used. Since these ratios are not fixed, it is also possible to obtain the juice of the invention with desired density.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0040">Heating operation is made following addition of water onto ash. Heating operation is ended when boiling starts in the water with ash, and then it is left for conditioning. In this way, after conditioning, the ash part is settled at the bottom of the container and the liquid part can easily be taken to another container from the top part.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0041">The most significant characteristic of the juice obtained from olive seed is having all the same benefits with olive seed. Among these benefits, the most important one is having cell regenerative characteristic.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0042">The juice of the invention is used in place of distilled water in all cosmetic and cosmeceutical fields. Since this juice has cell regenerative characteristic, it gives the highest performance in all kinds of formulations it enters.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0043">With the method of the invention, juice is obtained, which can be used in all kinds of cosmetic formulations as a base in place of distilled water, has high bioavailability, and has cell regenerative characteristics. The most significant characteristic of the water obtained is bringing the product performance to the top level in all kinds of cosmetic formulations. Having the top performance in cosmetic and dermatological means, the juice of the invention is considered to be superior to normal distilled and mineral water.</p>
