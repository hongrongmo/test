      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">This application relates to human Toll-like receptor (TLR) inhibitors, and methods for use in individuals having an autoimmune disease or an inflammatory disorder. The TLR inhibitors of the present disclosure are polynucleotides comprising an inhibitory motif for one or more of TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are type-I transmembrane proteins that recognize a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from bacteria, viruses and fungi. In this way PAMPs serve as a first-line of defense against invading pathogens. Human TLRs can elicit overlapping yet distinct biological responses due to differences in cellular expression and activation of downstream signal transduction pathways (Akira et al., Adv Immunol, 78: 1-56, 2001). TLRs are characterized by an ectodomain composed of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and a cytoplasmic domain, known as a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. The LRR-containing ectodomain is responsible for recognition of PAMPs, while the cytoplasmic domain is required for downstream signaling. Studies have shown that LRR8 is involved in DNA and RNA recognition, whereas LRR17 is involved in nucleic acid binding (Smits et al., Oncologist, 13: 859-875, 2008).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The TLRs located in the plasma membrane recognize bacterial membrane components, whereas the TLRs that detect nucleic acid-based ligands are predominately located within endosomal compartments. The nucleic acid-sensing TLRs include TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9. TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA, TLR7 and TLR8 recognize single-stranded RNA, and TLR9 recognizes bacterial and viral DNA as well as synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated CG dinucleotides (Akira and Hemmi, Immunol Lett, 85:85-95, 2003).</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">TLR8 belongs to the same subfamily as TLR7 and TLR9 and is highly homologous to TLR7 (Liu et al., Mol Immunol, 47:1083-90, 2010). Even so, the specificity of TLR8 for RNA and synthetic small molecules with a structure related to nucleic acids is not identical to that of TLR7 (Medzhitov et al., Immunol Rev, 173:-89-97, 2000). For instance, some ssRNA synthetic sequences containing repetitive A/U motifs are able to specifically activate TLR8 but not TLR7 (Gorden et al., J Immunol, 174:1259-68, 2005). Further, in humans, TLR8 is highly expressed in monocytes, macrophages, myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) and neutrophils, whereas TLR7 in blood cells is principally expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), B-cells, and neutrophils. Because of this difference in cellular expression, triggering by RNA through TLR7 in blood leads to a response dominated by Type I interferon (IFN) production, whereas activation through TLR8 induces multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-12, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1 (Barrat et al., J Exp Med, 202:1131-9, 2005; and Gorden et al., J Immunol, 174:1259-68, 2005).</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">TLRs have been implicated in various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, with the clearest example being the role played by TLR9 and TLR7 in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (Barrat and Coffman, Immunol Rev, 223:271-283, 2008). Additionally, a TLR8 polymorphism has been associated with rheumatoid arthritis (Enevold et al., J Rheumatol, 37:905-10, 2010). Although various TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 inhibitors have been described, additional TLR inhibitors are desirable. In particular, polynucleotides having inhibitory motifs for one or more of TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are needed to precisely inhibit an immune response in a subject (e.g., patient having an autoimmune disease or an inflammatory disorder).</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Additionally, several polynucleotides have been identified, which inhibit R848-induced cytokine secretion by mouse splenocytes. Mouse TLR8, however, lacks the ability to respond to ssRNA ligands, RNA viruses or small molecules, all of which have been shown to activate human TLR8 (Heil et al., Science, 303:1526-9, 2004; Jurk et al. Nat Immunol, 3:499, 2002; Hemmi et al., Nat. Immunol, 3:196-200, 2002; and Lund et al., PNAS, 101:5598-603, 2004). Further, by comparing amino acid sequences, TLR8 of mice and rats was found to lack a five amino-acid sequence required for ligand recognition in man (Liu et al., Mol Immunol, 47:1083-90, 2010). Thus polynucleotides having inhibitory motifs for human TLR8 are desirable for use in human subjects.</p>

      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Provided herein are human Toll-like receptor (TLR)-inhibitors and methods for use in inhibiting a TLR7-, a TLR8-, and/or a TLR9-dependent immune response in an individual. In some embodiments the individual has an autoimmune disease or an inflammatory disorder. The TLR inhibitors of the present disclosure are polynucleotides comprising an inhibitory motif for one or more of TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9. The following aspects of the present disclosure are described in more detail herein: general techniques; definitions, compositions, methods, and kits.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">I. General Techniques</heading>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The practice of the present disclosure employs, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of molecular biology (including recombinant techniques), microbiology, cell biology, chemistry, biochemistry and immunology, which are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature, such as, <i>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, </i>second edition (Sambrook et al., 1989); <i>Oligonucleotide Synthesis </i>(Gait, ed., 1984); <i>Animal Cell Culture </i>(Freshney, ed., 1987); <i>Handbook of Experimental Immunology </i>(Weir &amp; Blackwell, eds.); <i>Gene Transfer Vectors for Mammalian Cells </i>(Miller &amp; Calos, eds., 1987); <i>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology </i>(Ausubel et al., eds., 1987); <i>PCR: The Polymerase Chain Reaction </i>(Mullis et al., eds., 1994); <i>Current Protocols in Immunology </i>(Coligan et al., eds., 1991); <i>The Immunoassay Handbook </i>(Wild, ed., Stockton Press NY, 1994); <i>Bioconjugate Techniques </i>(Hermanson, ed., Academic Press, 1996); and <i>Methods of Immunological Analysis </i>(Masseyeff, Albert, and Staines, eds., Weinheim: VCH Verlags gesellschaft mbH, 1993).</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="2">II. Definitions</heading>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The terms ânucleic acid,â âpolynucleotide,â and âoligonucleotideâ are used interchangeably and include single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), modified polynucleotides and polynucleosides or combinations thereof. The polynucleotide can be linear, branched, or circularly configured, or the polynucleotide can contain one or more linear, branched, and/or circular segments. Polynucleotides are polymers of nucleosides joined, generally, through phosphodiester linkages, although alternate linkages, such as phosphorothioate esters may also be used. A nucleoside consists of a purine (adenine (A) or guanine (G) or derivative thereof) or pyrimidine (thymine (T), cytosine (C) or uracil (U), or derivative thereof) base bonded to a sugar. The four nucleoside units (or bases) in DNA are called deoxyadenosine, deoxyguanosine, thymidine, and deoxycytidine. The four nucleoside units (or bases) in RNA are called adenosine, guanosine, uridine and cytidine. A nucleotide is a phosphate ester of a nucleoside.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The term âagonistâ is used in the broadest sense and includes any molecule that activates signaling through a receptor. For instance, a TLR8 agonist binds a TLR8 receptor and activates a TLR8-signaling pathway.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The term âantagonistâ is used in the broadest sense, and includes any molecule that blocks a biological activity of an agonist. For instance, a TLR8 antagonist suppresses a TLR8-signaling pathway.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The terms âimmunoinhibitory sequenceâ and âIISâ, as used herein, refer to a nucleic acid sequence that inhibits a measurable immune response (e.g., measured in vitro, in vivo, and/or ex vivo).</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The terms âimmunostimulatory sequenceâ and âISSâ, as used herein, refer to a nucleic acid sequence that stimulates a measurable immune response (e.g., measured in vitro, in vivo, and/or ex vivo). For the purpose of the present disclosure, the term ISS refers to a nucleic acid sequence comprising an unmethylated CG dinucleotide.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">The effect of a polynucleotide on a TLR-dependent immune response can be determined in vitro by measuring a response of an immune cell (e.g., leukocytes such as lymphocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells) contacted with a TLR agonist in the presence and absence of the polynucleotide. Exemplary methods are described in Example 3. As referred to herein, a TLR inhibitor is a polynucleotide that inhibits a TLR-dependent immune response at an IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of less than 500 nM. Polynucleotides with an IC50 of less than 200 nM are considered to be highly active TLR inhibitors. Polynucleotides with an IC50 of from 201-500 nM are considered to be moderately active TLR inhibitors. Polynucleotides with an IC50 of greater than 500 nM are considered to be essentially inactive (e.g., not a TLR inhibitor).</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Examples of measurable immune responses include, but are not limited to, antigen-specific antibody production, cytokine secretion, lymphocyte activation and lymphocyte proliferation.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The terms âantisenseâ and âantisense sequenceâ as used herein refer to a non-coding strand of a polynucleotide having a sequence complementary to the coding strand of mRNA. In preferred embodiments, the polynucleotides of the present disclosure are not antisense sequences, or RNAi molecules (miRNA and siRNA). That is in preferred embodiments, the TLR inhibitors of the present disclosure do not have significant homology (or complementarity) to transcripts (or genes) of the mammalian subjects in which they will be used. For instance, a polynucleotide of the present disclosure for inhibiting a TLR-dependent immune response in a human subject is less than 80% identical over its length to nucleic acid sequences of the human genome (e.g., a 20 base human TLR8 inhibitor would share no more than 16 of the 20 bases with a human transcript including but not limited to a tlr8 mRNA). Specifically, TLR inhibitors are less than 80%, 75%, 70%, 65%, 60%, 55%, 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25% or 20%, identical to nucleic acid sequences of mammalian subjects (e.g., such as humans, nonhuman primates, farm animals, dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, mice, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The terms âmicroRNAâ and âmiRNAâ refer to a class of post-transcriptional regulators, in the form of short (Ë22 nucleotide) RNA sequences that bind to complementary sequences of target mRNAs, typically resulting in their silencing. The terms âsmall interfering RNA,â âshort interfering RNA,â and âsiRNAâ refer to a class of double-stranded RNA molecules, 20-25 base pairs in length, that interfere with expression of genes with complementary nucleotide sequences.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">âStimulationâ of a response or parameter includes eliciting and/or enhancing that response or parameter when compared to otherwise same conditions except for a parameter of interest, or alternatively, as compared to another condition (e.g., increase in TLR-signaling in the presence of a TLR agonist as compared to the absence of the TLR agonist). For example, âstimulationâ of an immune response means an increase in the response, which can arise from eliciting and/or enhancement of a response. Similarly, âstimulationâ of production of a cytokine (such as IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6, and/or TNF-Î±) or âstimulationâ of cell type (such as CTLs) means an increase in the amount or level of cytokine or cell type.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">âSuppressionâ or âinhibitionâ of a response or parameter includes decreasing that response or parameter when compared to otherwise same conditions except for a parameter of interest, or alternatively, as compared to another condition (e.g., increase in TLR-signaling in the presence of a TLR agonist and a TLR antagonist as compared to the presence of the TLR agonist in the absence of the TLR antagonist).</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The term âcells,â as used herein, is understood to refer not only to the particular subject cell, but to the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term as used herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The term âindividualâ refers to a mammal, including humans. An individual includes, but is not limited to, human, bovine, equine, feline, canine, rodent, or primate subjects.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">A âtransgenic animalâ is an animal containing one or more cells bearing genetic information received, directly or indirectly, by deliberate genetic manipulation at a subcellular level, such as by microinjection or infection with recombinant virus. This introduced DNA molecule may be integrated within a chromosome, or it may be extra-chromosomally replicating DNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">Administration âin combination withâ one or more further therapeutic agents includes simultaneous (concurrent) and consecutive administration in any order.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">âChronicâ administration refers to administration of the agent(s) in a continuous mode as opposed to an acute mode, so as to maintain the initial therapeutic effect (activity) for an extended period of time. âIntermittentâ administration refers to treatment that is not consecutively and/or continuously done without interruption, but rather is cyclic in nature.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">An âeffective amountâ of an agent disclosed herein is an amount sufficient to carry out a specifically stated purpose. An âeffective amountâ may be determined empirically and in a routine manner, in relation to the stated purpose.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The term âtherapeutically effective amountâ refers to an amount of an agent (e.g., TLR inhibitor) effective to âtreatâ a disease or disorder in a subject (e.g., a mammal such as a human). In the case of autoimmune disease, the therapeutically effective amount of the agent reduces a sign or symptom of the autoimmune disease. For instance in connection with treatment of a rheumatoid arthritis, a therapeutically effect amount of an agent (e.g., TLR inhibitor) reduces a sign or symptom of rheumatoid arthritis in a patient, which may also reduce the rate of damage to bone and cartilage.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The terms âtreatingâ or âtreatmentâ of a disease refer to executing a protocol, which may include administering one or more drugs to an individual (human or otherwise), in an effort to alleviate signs or symptoms of the disease. Thus, âtreatingâ or âtreatmentâ does not require complete alleviation of signs or symptoms, does not require a cure, and specifically includes protocols that have only a marginal effect on the individual.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">As used herein, and as well-understood in the art, âtreatmentâ is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results, including clinical results.

The modification of at least one nucleotide may be a modified base, a modified sugar, and/or a modified phosphate. In some embodiments, the modification of at least one nucleotide may be a naturally-occurring modification. In some embodiments, the modification of at least one nucleotide may be a synthetic modification. In some embodiments, the modifications may be imparted before or after assembly of the polynucleotide. In some embodiments, the modified nucleotide comprises one or more modified nucleosides. âModified nucleotideâ or âmodified nucleosideâ as used herein encompass nucleoside or nucleotide âanalogs.â The term ânucleotide analogâ refers to a compound that essentially retains the identity of the nucleotide from which it was derived. For instance, 7-dG is a G analog and N4-ethyl-dC is a C analog. As used herein, âmodified nucleotideâ or âmodified nucleosideâ also encompasses compounds that may not retain the identity of the nucleotide or base. That is the term modification encompasses a substitution of a nucleotide or base with a different naturally or non-naturally occurring nucleotide or base. For instance, the term modification encompasses substitution of an A for a G.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0120">In some embodiments, one or more nucleotides of the polynucleotide comprises at least one modification (e.g., nucleotide comprises a modification). In some embodiments, one or more nucleotides of the polynucleotide comprise a modification (e.g., sequence Nx comprises a modification). In some embodiments, the at least one modification is the same modification for each nucleotide that is modified. In some embodiments, every nucleotide of the polynucleotide is modified and the modification is a 2â²-O-methyl sugar modification (i.e., nucleotide N consists of a modification and the modification is a 2â²-O-methyl sugar modification). In some embodiments, the at least one modification comprises more than one different type of modifications of nucleotides.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0121">In some embodiments, the modification of at least one nucleotide comprises a modified base. Examples of base modifications include, but are not limited to, addition of an electron-withdrawing moiety to C-5 and/or C-6 of a cytosine of a polynucleotide. Preferably, the electron-withdrawing moiety is a halogen, e.g., 5-bromocytosine, 5-chlorocytosine, 5-fluorocytosine, 5-iodocytosine. In some embodiments, the base modifications include, but are not limited to, addition of an electron-withdrawing moiety to C-5 and/or C-6 of a uracil of the immunoinhibitory polynucleotide. Preferably, the electron-withdrawing moiety is a halogen. Such modified uracils can include, but are not limited to, 5-bromouracil, 5-chlorouracil, 5-fluorouracil, 5-iodouracil. In some embodiments, the base modifications include the addition of one or more thiol groups to the base including, but not limited to, 6-thio-guanine, 4-thio-thymine, and 4-thio-uracil. In some embodiments, the base modifications include, but are not limited to, N4-ethylcytosine, 7-deazaguanine, and 5-hydroxycytosine. See, for example, Kandimalla et al. (2001) <i>Bioorg. Med.

In some embodiments, the methylation modification comprises a 5â²-methyl-cytosine modification. In some embodiments, a TLR inhibitor comprises multiple base modifications. In some embodiments, the base modifications are the same. In some embodiments, the base modifications are different. In some embodiments, a TLR inhibitor comprises any of about 1, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5 different base modifications. Base modifications may also be made and combined with any phosphate modification and/or sugar modification in the preparation of a modified TLR inhibitor.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0122">In some embodiments, the modification of at least one nucleotide comprises a modified phosphate. In some embodiments, the modified phosphate is a phosphodiester linkage modification. For example, phosphate modifications may include, but are not limited to, methyl phosphonate, phosphorothioate, phosphoamidates, phosphoramidate (bridging or non-bridging), phosphotriester and phosphorodithioate and may be used in any combination. In some embodiments, the modified phosphate is a 3â²-terminal internucleotide phosphodiester linkage modification. For example, the 3â²-terminal internucleotide phosphodiester linkage modifications include, but are not limited to, an alkyl or aryl phosphotriester, an alkyl or aryl phosphonate, a hydrogen phosphonate, a phosphoramidate, and/or a phosphoroselenate linkage modification. In some embodiments, the 3â²-terminal internucleotide phophodiester linkage modification is a phosphoramidate modification. In some embodiments, the modified phosphate includes, but is not limited to, embodiments wherein the phosphate is replaced by P(O)S (âthioateâ), P(S)S (âdithioateâ), (O)NR2 (âamidateâ), P(O)R, P(R)ORâ², CO or CH2 (âformacetalâ), in which each R or Râ² is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C), optionally containing an ether (âOâ) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloaklyl, cycloalkenyl, or araldyl.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0123">In some embodiments, a TLR inhibitor may comprise at least one nucleotide comprising at least one phosphorothioate backbone linkage. In some embodiments, polynucleotides of the TLR inhibitor comprise only phosphorothioate backbones. In some embodiments, polynucleotides of the TLR inhibitor comprise one or more phosphorothioate backbones. In some embodiments, polynucleotides of the TLR inhibitor comprise only phosphodiester backbones. In some embodiments, an TLR inhibitor may comprise a combination of phosphate linkages in the phosphate backbone including, but not limited to, a combination of phosphodiester and phosphorothioate linkages.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0124">The TLR inhibitor can contain phosphate-modified polynucleotides, some of which may stabilize the polynucleotide. Accordingly, some embodiments include a stabilized immunoinhibitory polynucleotides. In some embodiments, a TLR inhibitor comprises multiple phosphate modifications. In some embodiments, the phosphate modifications are the same. In some embodiments, the phosphate modifications are different. In some embodiments, the TLR inhibitor comprises any of about 1, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5 different phosphate modifications. Phosphate modifications may also be made and combined with any base modification and/or sugar modification in the preparation of a modified TLR inhibitor.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0125">In some embodiments, the modification of at least one nucleotide comprises a modified sugar. TLR inhibitors used in the present disclosure may comprise one or more modified sugars or sugar analogs. Thus, in addition to ribose and deoxyribose, the sugar moiety can be pentose, deoxypentose, hexose, deoxyhexose, glucose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, and a sugar âanalogâ cyclopentyl group. The sugar can be in pyranosyl or in a furanosyl form. In the TLR inhibitor, the sugar moiety is preferably the furanoside of ribose, deoxyribose, arabinose or 2â²-O-alkylribose. In some embodiments, the sugar can be attached to the respective heterocyclic bases either in Î± or Î² anomeric configuration. In some embodiments, the sugar is modified by replacing a hydroxyl group ordinarily present. The hydroxyl group ordinarily present in the sugar may be replaced by, for example, but not limited to, phosphonate groups or phosphate groups. The 5â² and 3â² terminal hydroxyl group can additionally be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the modified sugars are 2â²-sugar modifications including, but are not limited to, 2â²-alkoxy-RNA analogs, 2â²-amino-RNA analogs, 2â²-fluoro-DNA, and 2â²-alkoxy- or amino-RNA/DNA chimeras.

      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0148">Exemplary non-nucleic acid spacers comprise oligo-ethylene glycol (e.g., triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, hexaethylene glycol spacers, and other polymers comprising up to about 10, about 20, about 40, about 50, about 100 or about 200 ethylene glycol units), alkyl spacers (e.g., propyl, butyl, hexyl, and other C2-C12 alkyl spacers, e.g., usually C2-C10 alkyl, most often C2-C6 alkyl), abasic nucleotide spacers, symmetric or asymmetric spacers derived from glycerol, pentaerythritol or 1,3,5-trihydroxycyclohexane (e.g., symmetrical doubler and trebler spacer moieties described herein). Spacers can also comprise heteromeric or homomeric oligomers and polymers of the aforementioned compounds (e.g., linked by an amide, ester, ether, thioether, disulfide, phosphodiester, phosphorothioate, phosphoramidate, phosphotriester, phosphorodithioate, methyl phosphonate or other linkage).</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0149">Suitable spacer moieties can contribute charge and/or hydrophobicity to the TLR inhibitors, contribute favorable pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., improved stability, longer residence time in blood) to the TLR inhibitor, and/or result in targeting of the TLR inhibitor to particular cells or organs. Spacer moieties can be selected or modified to tailor the TLR inhibitor for desired pharmacokinetic properties or suitability for desired modes of administration (e.g., oral administration). It will be appreciated by the reader that, for convenience, a spacer (or spacer component) is sometimes referred to by the chemical name of the compound from which the spacer component is derived (e.g., hexaethylene glycol), with the understanding that the TLR inhibitor actually comprises the conjugate of the compound and adjacent nucleic acid moieties or other spacer moiety components.</p>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0150">In a TLR inhibitor comprising more than one spacer moiety, the spacers may be the same or different. Thus, in one variation all of the non-nucleic acid spacer moieties in a TLR inhibitor have the same structure. In one variation, a TLR inhibitor comprises non-nucleic acid spacer moieties with at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, or at least 6 or more different structures.</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0151">In some contemplated embodiments, the spacer moiety of a TLR inhibitor is defined to exclude certain structures. Thus, in some embodiments, a spacer is other than an abasic nucleotide or polymer of abasic nucleotides. In some embodiments, a spacer is other than a oligo(ethyleneglycol) (e.g., HEG, TEG and the like) or poly(ethyleneglycol). In some embodiments a spacer is other than a C3 alkyl spacer. In some embodiments, a spacer is other than a polypeptide. Thus, in some embodiments, an immunogenic molecule, e.g., a protein or polypeptide, is not suitable as a component of spacer moieties. However, as discussed infra, it is contemplated that in certain embodiments, a TLR inhibitor is a âproteinaceous TLR inhibitorâ (i.e., comprising a spacer moiety comprising a polypeptide). However, in some embodiments, the spacer moiety is not proteinaceous and/or is not an antigen (i.e., the spacer moiety, if isolated from the TLR inhibitor, is not an antigen).</p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0152">Generally, suitable spacer moieties do not render the TLR inhibitor of which they are a component insoluble in an aqueous solution (e.g., PBS, pH 7.0). Thus, the definition of spacers excludes microcarriers or nanocarriers. In addition, a spacer moiety that has low solubility, such as a dodecyl spacer (solubility &lt;5 mg/ml when measured as dialcohol precursor 1,12-dihydroxydodecane) is not preferred because it can reduce the hydrophilicity and activity of the IRC. Preferably, spacer moieties have solubility much greater than 5 mg/ml (e.g., â§20 mg/ml, â§50 mg/ml or â§100 mg/ml) when measured as dialcohol precursors.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0153">The charge of a TLR inhibitor may be contributed by phosphate, thiophosphate, or other groups in the nucleic acid moieties as well as groups in non-nucleic acid spacer moieties. In some embodiments, a non-nucleic acid spacer moiety carries a net charge (e.g., a net positive charge or net negative charge when measured at pH 7). In one useful variation, the TLR inhibitor has a net negative charge. In some embodiments, the negative charge of a spacer moiety in a TLR inhibitor is increased by derivatizing a spacer subunit described herein to increase its charge. For example, glycerol can be covalently bound to two nucleic acid moieties and the remaining alcohol can be reacted with an activated phosphoramidite, followed by oxidation or sulfurization to form a phosphate or thiophosphate, respectively. In certain embodiments the negative charge contributed by the non-nucleic acid spacer moieties in a TLR inhibitor (i.e., the sum of the charges when there is more than one spacer) is greater than the negative charge contributed by the nucleic acid moieties of the TLR inhibitor. Charge can be calculated based on molecular formula, or determined experimentally, e.g., by capillary electrophoresis (Li, ed., 1992, <i>Capillary electrophoresis, Principles, Practice and Application </i>Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, pp202-206).</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0154">As is noted supra, suitable spacers can be polymers of smaller non-nucleic acid (e.g., non-nucleotide) compounds, such as those described herein, that are themselves useful as spacers, including compounds commonly referred to as non-nucleotide âlinkers.â Such polymers (i.e., âmultiunit spacersâ) may be heteromeric or homomeric, and often comprise monomeric units (e.g., HEG, TEG, glycerol, 1â²2â²-dideoxyribose, and the like) linked by an ester linkage (e.g., phosphodiester or phosphorothioate ester). Thus, in one variation the spacer comprises a polymeric (e.g., heteropolymeric) structure of non-nucleotide units (e.g., from 2 to about 100 units, alternatively 2 to about 50, e.g., 2 to about 5, alternatively e.g., about 5 to about 50, e.g., about 5 to about 20).</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0155">In certain embodiments, a spacer moiety is a multivalent non-nucleic acid spacer moiety (i.e., a âmultivalent spacerâ). As used in this context, a TLR inhibitor containing a multivalent spacer contains a spacer covalently bound to three (3) or more nucleic acid moieties. Multivalent spacers are sometimes referred to in the art as âplatform molecules.â Multivalent spacers can be polymeric or nonpolymeric. Examples of suitable molecules include glycerol or substituted glycerol (e.g., 2-hydroxymethyl glycerol, levulinyl-glycerol); tetraaminobenzene, heptaaminobetacyclodextrin, 1,3,5-trihydroxycyclohexane, pentaerythritol and derivatives of pentaerythritol, tetraaminopentaerythritol, 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclo tetradecane (Cyclam), 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (Cyclen), polyethyleneimine, 1,3-diamino-2-propanol and substituted derivatives, propyloxymethyl]ethyl compounds (e.g., âtreblerâ), polyethylene glycol derivatives such as so-called âStar PEGsâ and âbPEGâ (see, e.g., Gnanou et al. (1988) <i>Makromol. Chem. </i>189:2885; Rein et al. (1993) <i>Acta Polymer </i>44:225; U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,264), and dendrimers.</p>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0156">Dendrimers are known in the art and are chemically defined globular molecules, generally prepared by stepwise or reiterative reaction of multifunctional monomers to obtain a branched structure (see, e.g., Tomalia et al. (1990) <i>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. </i>29:138-75). A variety of dendrimers are known, e.g., amine-terminated polyamidoamine, polyethyleneimine and polypropyleneimine dendrimers. Exemplary dendrimers useful include âdense starâ polymers or âstarburstâ polymers such as those described in U. S. Pat. Nos. 4,587,329; 5,338,532; and 6,177,414, including so-called âpoly(amidoamine) (âPAMAMâ) dendrimers.â Still other multimeric spacer molecules suitable for use include chemically-defined, non-polymeric valency platform molecules such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,552,391; and PCT application publications WO 00/75105, WO 96/40197, WO 97/46251, WO 95/07073, and WO 00/34231. Many other suitable multivalent spacers can be used and will be known to those of skill in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0157">Conjugation of a nucleic acid moiety to a platform molecule can be effected in any number of ways, typically involving one or more crosslinking agents and functional groups on the nucleic acid moiety and platform molecule. Linking groups are added to platforms using standard synthetic chemistry techniques. Linking groups can be added to nucleic acid moieties using standard synthetic techniques.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0158">Multivalent spacers with a variety of valencies are useful, and in various embodiments the multivalent spacer of a TLR inhibitor is bound to between about 3 and about 400 nucleic acid moieties, often from 3 to 100, sometimes from 3-50, frequently from 3-10, and sometimes more than 400 nucleic acid moieties. In various embodiments, the multivalent spacer is conjugated to more than 10, more than 25, more than 50, or more than 500 nucleic acid moieties (which may be the same or different). It will be appreciated that, in certain embodiments in which a TLR inhibitor comprises a multivalent spacer, provided herein is a population of TLR inhibitors with slightly different molecular structures. For example, when a TLR inhibitor is prepared using a dendrimer as a high valency the multivalent spacer, a somewhat heterogeneous mixture of molecules is produced, i.e., comprising different numbers (within or predominantly within a determinable range) of nucleic acid moieties joined to each dendrimer molecule.</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0159">Polysaccharides derivatized to allow linking to nucleic acid moieties can be used as spacers in TLR inhibitors. Suitable polysaccharides include naturally occurring polysaccharides (e.g., dextran) and synthetic polysaccharides (e.g., FICOLLÂ®). For instance, aminoethylcarboxymethyl-FICOLLÂ® (AECM-FICOLLÂ®) can be prepared by the method of Inman (1975) <i>J. Imm. </i>114:704-709. AECM- FICOLLÂ® can then be reacted with a heterobifunctional crosslinking reagent, such as 6-maleimido caproic acyl N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, and then conjugated to a thiol-derivatized nucleic acid moiety (see Lee et al. (1980) <i>Mol. Imm. </i>17:749-56). Other polysaccharides may be modified similarly.</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0160">It will be well within the ability of one of skill, guided by this specification and knowledge in the art, to prepare TLR inhibitors using routine methods. Techniques for making nucleic acid moieties (e.g., oligonucleotides and modified oligonucleotides) are known. Nucleic acid moieties can be synthesized using techniques including, but not limited to, enzymatic methods and chemical methods and combinations of enzymatic and chemical approaches. For example, DNA or RNA containing phosphodiester linkages can be chemically synthesized by sequentially coupling the appropriate nucleoside phosphoramidite to the 5â²-hydroxy group of the growing oligonucleotide attached to a solid support at the 3â²-end, followed by oxidation of the intermediate phosphite triester to a phosphate triester. Useful solid supports for DNA synthesis include Controlled Pore Glass (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.), polystyrene bead matrix (Primer Support, Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.) and TentGel (Rapp Polymere GmbH, Tubingen, Germany). Once the desired oligonucleotide sequence has been synthesized, the oligonucleotide is removed from the support, the phosphate triester groups are deprotected to phosphate diesters and the nucleoside bases are deprotected using aqueous ammonia or other bases.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0161">For instance, DNA or RNA or DNA/RNA hybrid polynucleotides (nucleic acid moieties) containing phosphodiester linkages are generally synthesized by repetitive iterations of the following steps: a) removal of the protecting group from the 5â²-hydroxyl group of the 3â²-solid support-bound nucleoside or nucleic acid, b) coupling of the activated nucleoside phosphoramidite to the 5â²-hydroxyl group, c) oxidation of the phosphite triester to the phosphate triester, and d) capping of unreacted 5â²-hydroxyl groups. DNA or RNA containing phosphorothioate linkages is prepared as described above, except that the oxidation step is replaced with a sulfurization step. Once the desired oligonucleotide sequence has been synthesized, the oligonucleotide is removed from the support, the phosphate triester groups are deprotected to phosphate diesters and the nucleoside bases are deprotected using aqueous ammonia or other bases.

Lett. 4:1519-1522; Radhakrishna et al. (1989) <i>J. Org. Chem. </i>55:4693-4699. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,066. Programmable machines that automatically synthesize nucleic acid moieties of specified sequences are widely available. Examples include the Expedite 8909 automated DNA synthesizer (Perseptive Biosystem, Framington Mass.); the ABI 394 (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, Calif.); and the OligoPilot II (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.).</p>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0162">Polynucleotides can be assembled in the 3â² to 5â² direction, e.g., using base-protected nucleosides (monomers) containing an acid-labile 5â²-protecting group and a 3â²-phosphoramidite. Examples of such monomers include 5â²-O-(4,4â²-dimethoxytrityl)-protected nucleoside-3â²-O-(N,N-diisopropylamino)2-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite, where examples of the protected nucleosides include, but are not limited to, N6-benzoyladenosine, N4-benzoylcytidine, N2-isobutryrylguanosine, thymidine, and uridine. In this case, the solid support used contains a 3â²-linked protected nucleoside. Alternatively, polynucleotides can be assembled in the 5â² to 3â² direction using base-protected nucleosides containing an acid-labile 3â²-protecting group and a 5â²-phosphoramidite. Examples of such monomers include 3â²-O-(4,4â²-dimethoxytrityl)-protected nucleoside-5â²-O-(N,N-diisopropylamino)2-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite, where examples of the protected nucleosides include, but are not limited to, N6-benzoyladenosine, N4-benzoylcytidine, N2-isobutryrylguanosine, thymidine, and uridine (Glen Research, Sterling, Va.). In this case, the solid support used contains a 5â²-linked protected nucleoside. Circular nucleic acid components can be isolated, synthesized through recombinant methods, or chemically synthesized. Chemical synthesis can be performed using any method described in the literature. See, for instance, Gao et al. (1995) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>23:2025-2029 and Wang et al. (1994) Nucleic Acids Res. 22:2326-2333.</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0163">Addition of non-nucleic acid spacer moieties can be accomplished using routine methods. Methods for addition of particular spacer moieties are known in the art and, for example, are described in the references cited supra. See, e.g., Durand et al. (1990) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>18:6353-6359. The covalent linkage between a spacer moiety and nucleic acid moiety can be any of a number of types, including phosphodiester, phosphorothioate, amide, ester, ether, thioether, disulfide, phosphoramidate, phosphotriester, phosphorodithioate, methyl phosphonate and other linkages. It will often be convenient to combine a spacer moiety(s) and a nucleic acid moiety(s) using the same phosphoramidite-type chemistry used for synthesis of the nucleic acid moiety. For example, IRCs described herein can be conveniently synthesized using an automated DNA synthesizer (e.g., Expedite 8909; Perseptive Biosystems, Framington, Mass.) using phosphoramidite chemistry (see, e.g., Beaucage, 1993, supra; <i>Current Protocols in Nucleic Acid Chemistry, </i>supra). However, one of skill will understand that the same (or equivalent) synthesis steps carried out by an automated DNA synthesizer can also be carried out manually, if desired. In such a synthesis, typically, one end of the spacer (or spacer subunit for multimeric spacers) is protected with a 4,4â²-dimethyoxytrityl group, while the other end contains a phosphoramidite group.</p>

      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0165">These and a large variety of other protected spacer moiety precursors (e.g., comprising DMT and phosphoramidite group protecting groups) can be purchased or can be synthesized using routine methods for use in preparing IRCs disclosed herein. The instrument is programmed according to the manufacturer's instructions to add nucleotide monomers and spacers in the desired order.</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0166">Although use of phosphoramidite chemistry is convenient for the preparation of certain TLR inhibitors, it will be appreciated that the TLR inhibitors described herein are not limited to compounds prepared by any particular method of synthesis or preparation.</p>
      <p id="p-00203-en" num="0167">In one variation, TLR inhibitors with multivalent spacers conjugated to more than one type of nucleic acid moiety are prepared. For instance, platforms containing two maleimide groups (which can react with thiol-containing polynucleotides), and two activated ester groups (which can react with amino-containing nucleic acids) have been described (see, e.g., PCT application publication WO 95/07073). These two activated groups can be reacted independently of each other. This would result in a TLR inhibitor containing a total of 4 nucleic acid moieties, two of each sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0168">TLR inhibitors with multivalent spacers containing two different nucleic acid sequences can also be prepared using the symmetrical branched spacer, described above, and conventional phosphoramidite chemistry (e.g., using manual or automated methods). The symmetrical branched spacer contains a phosphoramidite group and two protecting groups that are the same and are removed simultaneously. In one approach, for example, a first nucleic acid is synthesized and coupled to the symmetrical branched spacer, the protecting groups are removed from the spacer. Then two additional nucleic acids (of the same sequence) are synthesized on the spacer (using double the amount of reagents used for synthesis of a single nucleic acid moiety in each step).</p>
      <p id="p-00205-en" num="0169">A similar method can be used to connect three different nucleic acid moieties (referred to below as Nucleic acids I, II, and III) to a multivalent platform (e.g., asymmetrical branched spacer). This is most conveniently carried out using an automated DNA synthesizer. In one variation, the asymmetrical branched spacer contains a phosphoramidite group and two orthogonal protecting groups that can be removed independently. First, nucleic acid I is synthesized, then the asymmetrical branched spacer is coupled to nucleic acid I, then nucleic acid II is added after the selective removal of one of the protecting groups. Nucleic acid II is deprotected, and capped, and then the other protecting group on the spacer is removed. Finally, nucleic acid III is synthesized.</p>
      <p id="p-00206-en" num="0170">In some embodiments, a nucleic acid moiety(s) is synthesized, and a reactive linking group (e.g., amino, carboxylate, thiol, disulfide, and the like) is added using standard synthetic chemistry techniques. The reactive linking group (which is considered to form a portion of the resulting spacer moiety) is conjugated to additional non-nucleic acid compounds to form the spacer moiety. Linking groups are added to nucleic acids using standard methods for nucleic acid synthesis, employing a variety of reagents described in the literature or commercially available. Examples include reagents that contain a protected amino group, carboxylate group, thiol group, or disulfide group and a phosphoramidite group. Once these compounds are incorporated into the nucleic acids, via the activated phosphoramidite group, and are deprotected, they provide nucleic acids with amino, carboxylate, or thiol reactivity.</p>
      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0171">Hydrophilic linkers of variable lengths are useful, for example to link nucleic acids moieties and platform molecules. A variety of suitable linkers are known. Suitable linkers include, without limitation, linear oligomers or polymers of ethylene glycol. Such linkers include linkers with the formula R<sup>1</sup>S(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>R<sup>2 </sup>wherein n=0-200, m=1 or 2, R<sup>1</sup>âH or a protecting group such as trityl, R<sup>2</sup>âH or alkyl or aryl, e.g., 4-nitrophenyl ester. These linkers are useful in connecting a molecule containing a thiol reactive group such as haloaceyl, maleiamide, etc., via a thioether to a second molecule which contains an amino group via an amide bond. The order of attachment can vary, i.e., the thioether bond can be formed before or after the amide bond is formed. Other useful linkers include Sulfo-SMCC (sulfosuccinimidyl4-[N-maleimidomethyl]-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) Pierce Chemical Co. product 22322; Sulfo-EMCS (N-[epsilon-maleimidocaproyloxyl sulfosuccinimide ester) Pierce Chemical Co. product 22307; Sulfo-GMBS (N-[gamma-maleimidobutyryloxy]sulfosuccinimide ester) Pierce Chemical Co. product 22324 (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill.), and similar compounds of the general formula maleimido-RâC(O)NHS ester, where R=alkyl, cyclic alkyl, polymers of ethylene glycol, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00208-en" num="0172">Particularly useful methods for covalently joining nucleic acid moieties to multivalent spacers are described in the references cited supra.</p>
      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0173">In certain embodiments, a polypeptide is used as a multivalent spacer moiety to which a plurality of nucleic acid moieties are covalently conjugated, directly or via linkers, to form a âproteinaceous TLR inhibitor.â The polypeptide can be a carrier (e.g., albumin). Typically, a proteinaceous carrier comprises at least one, and usually several or many nucleic acid moieties that (a) are between 2 and 7, more often between 4 and 7 nucleotides in length, alternatively between 2 and 6, 2 and 5, 4 and 6, or 4 and 5 nucleotides in length and/or (b) have inferior isolated immunomodulatory activity as compared to a longer polynucleotide (e.g., at least 8 nucleotides in length) comprising a TLR inhibitory motif. Methods of making a proteinaceous TLR inhibitor will be apparent to one of skill upon review of the present disclosure. A nucleic acid, for example, can be covalently conjugated to a polypeptide spacer moiety by art known methods including linkages between a 3â² or 5â² end of a nucleic acid moiety (or at a suitably modified base at an internal position in the a nucleic acid moiety) and a polypeptide with a suitable reactive group (e.g., an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, which can be reacted directly with the N<sup>4 </sup>amino group of cytosine residues). As a further example, a polypeptide can be attached to a free 5â²-end of a nucleic acid moiety through an amine, thiol, or carboxyl group that has been incorporated into nucleic acid moiety. Alternatively, the polypeptide can be conjugated to a spacer moiety, as described herein. Further, a linking group comprising a protected amine, thiol, or carboxyl at one end, and a phosphoramidite can be covalently attached to a hydroxyl group of a polynucleotide, and, subsequent to deprotection, the functionality can be used to covalently attach the TLR inhibitor to a peptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0174">Isolation and Synthesis of Polynucleotides</p>
      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0175">Provided herein are also methods of making the polynucleotides comprising an inhibitory motif for one or more of TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 as described herein. In some embodiments, the polynucleotides comprise modified TLR inhibitory motif sequences. In some embodiments, the polynucleotides comprise unmodified TLR inhibitory motif sequences. The methods may be any of those described herein. For example, the method could be synthesizing the TLR inhibitors (for example, using solid state synthesis) and may further comprise any purification step(s). Methods of purification are known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0176">Also provided are methods for isolating and synthesizing immunoinhibitory polynucleotides comprising an inhibitory motif for one or more of TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 (TLR inhibitor). In some embodiments, the TLR inhibitor is a modified TLR inhibitor. In some embodiments, the TLR inhibitor is an unmodified TLR inhibitor.</p>
      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0177">The techniques for making polynucleotides and modified polynucleotides are known in the art. Naturally occurring DNA or RNA, containing phosphodiester linkages, is generally synthesized by sequentially coupling the appropriate nucleoside phosphoramidite to the 5â²-hydroxy group of the growing oligonucleotide attached to a solid support at the 3â²-end, followed by oxidation of the intermediate phosphite triester to a phosphate triester. Once the desired polynucleotide sequence has been synthesized, the polynucleotide is removed from the support, the phosphate triester groups are deprotected to phosphate diesters and the nucleoside bases are deprotected using aqueous ammonia or other bases. See, for example, Beaucage (1993) âOligodeoxyribonucleotide Synthesisâ in Protocols for Oligonucleotides and Analogs, Synthesis and Properties (Agrawal, ed.) Humana Press, Totowa, N.J.; Warner et al. (1984) <i>DNA </i>3:401 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,066.</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0178">Synthesis of polynucleotides containing modified phosphate linkages or non-phosphate linkages is also known in the art. For a review, see Matteucci (1997) âOligonucleotide Analogs: an Overviewâ in Oligonucleotides as Therapeutic Agents, (D. J. Chadwick and G. Cardew, ed.) John Wiley and Sons, New York, N.Y. The phosphorous derivative (or modified phosphate group) which can be attached to the sugar or sugar analog moiety in the polynucleotides can be a monophosphate, diphosphate, triphosphate, alkylphosphonate, phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoramidate or the like. The preparation of the above-noted phosphate analogs, and their incorporation into nucleotides, modified nucleotides and oligonucleotides, per se, is also known and need not be described here in detail. Peyrottes et al. (1996) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>24:1841-1848; Chaturvedi et al. (1996) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>24:2318-2323; and Schultz et al. (1996) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>24:2966-2973. For example, synthesis of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides is similar to that described above for naturally occurring oligonucleotides except that the oxidation step is replaced by a sulfurization step (Zon (1993) âOligonucleoside Phosphorothioatesâ in Protocols for Oligonucleotides and Analogs, Synthesis and Properties (Agrawal, ed.) Humana Press, pp. 165-190). Similarly the synthesis of other phosphate analogs, such as phosphotriester (Miller et al. (1971) <i>JACS </i>93:6657-6665), non-bridging phosphoramidates (Jager et al. (1988) <i>Biochem. </i>27:7247-7246), N3â² to P5â² phosphoramidiates (Nelson et al. (1997) <i>JOC </i>62:7278-7287) and phosphorodithioates (U.S. Pat. No. 5,453,496) has also been described. Other non-phosphorous based modified oligonucleotides can also be used (Stirchak et al. (1989) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>17:6129-6141).</p>
      <p id="p-00215-en" num="0179">Those skilled in the art will recognize that a large number of âsyntheticâ non-natural nucleosides comprising various heterocyclic bases and various sugar moieties (and sugar analogs) are available in the art, and that as long as other criteria of the present disclosure are satisfied, the TLR inhibitor can include one or several heterocyclic bases other than the principal five base components of naturally-occurring nucleic acids. Preferably, however, the heterocyclic base in the TLR inhibitor includes, but is not limited to, uracil-5-yl, cytosin-5-yl, adenin-7-yl, adenin-8-yl, guanin-7-yl, guanin-8-yl, 4-aminopyrrolo[2.3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl, 2-amino-4-oxopyrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl, 2-amino-4-oxopyrolo[2.3-d]pyrimidin-3-yl groups, where the purines are attached to the sugar moiety of the TLR inhibitor via the 9-position, the pyrimidines via the 1-position, the pyrrolopyrimidines via the 7-position and the pyrazolopyrimidines via the 1-position.</p>
      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0180">The preparation of base-modified nucleosides, and the synthesis of modified oligonucleotides using the base-modified nucleosides as precursors, has been described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,910,300, 4,948,882, and 5,093,232. These base-modified nucleosides have been designed so that they can be incorporated by chemical synthesis into either terminal or internal positions of an oligonucleotide. Such base-modified nucleosides, present at either terminal or internal positions of an oligonucleotide, can serve as sites for attachment of a peptide. Nucleosides modified in their sugar moiety have also been described (including, but not limited to, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,849,513, 5,015,733, 5,118,800, 5,118,802) and can be used similarly.</p>
      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0181">TLR inhibitor Complexes</p>
      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0182">TLR inhibitors can be directly administered to the individual or they can be administered in a composition or complex to enhance TLR inhibitor delivery to cells and/or uptake by cells. Compositions or complexes can also be used to enhance co-delivery of two of more different TLR inhibitors to a cell. In some embodiments, a mixture of TLR inhibitors may be complexed so as to deliver at least one TLR inhibitor.</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0183">Such delivery compositions or complexes include, but are not limited to, encapsulating complexes and colloidal dispersion systems as described herein and known in the art. Examples of such delivery compositions include oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, and liposomes. Delivery compositions or complexes also include TLR inhibitors linked to a linker molecules, a platform molecule, a nanoparticle or a microparticle, as described herein. Such linkages include both covalent and non-covalent linkages.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0184">In some embodiments, the TLR inhibitor is conjugated with a linker molecule in a variety of ways, including covalent and/or non-covalent interactions.</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0185">The link between the portions can be made at the 3â² or 5â² end of the TLR inhibitor, or at a suitably modified base at an internal position in the TLR inhibitor. If the linker is a peptide and contains a suitable reactive group (e.g., an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) it can be reacted directly with the N<sup>4 </sup>amino group of cytosine residues. Depending on the number and location of cytosine residues in the TLR inhibitor, specific coupling at one or more residues can be achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0186">Alternatively, modified oligonucleosides, such as are known in the art, can be incorporated at either terminus, or at internal positions in the TLR inhibitor. These can contain blocked functional groups which, when deblocked, are reactive with a variety of functional groups which can be present on, or attached to, the linker of interest.</p>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0187">Where the linker is a peptide, this portion of the conjugate can be attached to the 3â²-end of the TLR inhibitor through solid support chemistry. For example, the TLR inhibitor portion can be added to a peptide portion that has been pre-synthesized on a support. Haralambidis et al. (1990a) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>18:493-499; and Haralambidis et al. (1990b) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>18:501-505. Alternatively, the TLR inhibitor can be synthesized such that it is connected to a solid support through a cleavable linker extending from the 3â²-end. Upon chemical cleavage of the TLR inhibitor from the support, a terminal thiol group is left at the 3â²-end of the oligonucleotide (Zuckermann et al. (1987) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>15:5305-5321; and Corey et al. (1987) <i>Science </i>238:1401-1403) or a terminal amino group is left at the 3â²-end of the oligonucleotide (Nelson et al. (1989) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>17:1781-1794). Conjugation of the amino-modified TLR inhibitor to amino groups of the peptide can be performed as described in Benoit et al. (1987) <i>Neuromethods </i>6:43-72. Conjugation of the thiol-modified TLR inhibitor to carboxyl groups of the peptide can be performed as described in Sinah et al. (1991) <i>Oligonucleotide Analogues: A Practical Approach, </i>IRL Press. Coupling of an oligonucleotide carrying an appended maleimide to the thiol side chain of a cysteine residue of a peptide has also been described. Tung et al. (1991) <i>Bioconjug. Chem. </i>2:464-465.</p>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0188">The peptide linker portion of the conjugate can be attached to the 5â²-end of the TLR inhibitor through an amine, thiol, or carboxyl group that has been incorporated into the oligonucleotide during its synthesis. Preferably, while the oligonucleotide is fixed to the solid support, a linking group comprising a protected amine, thiol, or carboxyl at one end, and a phosphoramidite at the other, is covalently attached to the 5â²-hydroxyl. Agrawal et al. (1986) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>14:6227-6245; Connolly (1985) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>13:4485-4502; Kremsky et al. (1987) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>15:2891-2909; Connolly (1987) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>15:3131-3139; Bischoff et al. (1987) <i>Anal. Biochem. </i>164:336-344; Blanks et al. (1988) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>16:10283-10299; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,849,513, 5,015,733, 5,118,800, and 5,118,802. Subsequent to deprotection, the amine, thiol, and carboxyl functionalities can be used to covalently attach the oligonucleotide to a peptide. Benoit et al. (1987); and Sinah et al. (1991).</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0189">A TLR inhibitor conjugate can also be formed through non-covalent interactions, such as ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds and/or van der Waals attractions.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0190">Non-covalently linked conjugates can include a non-covalent interaction such as a biotin-streptavidin complex. A biotinyl group can be attached, for example, to a modified base of a TLR inhibitor. Roget et al. (1989) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>17:7643-7651. Incorporation of a streptavidin moiety into the peptide portion allows formation of a non-covalently bound complex of the streptavidin conjugated peptide and the biotinylated oligonucleotide.</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0191">Non-covalent associations can also occur through ionic interactions involving a TLR inhibitor through the use of a linker portion comprising charged residues that can interact with an oligonucleotide. For example, non-covalent conjugation can occur between a generally negatively-charged TLR inhibitor and positively-charged amino acid residues of a peptide linker, e.g., polylysine, polyarginine and polyhistidine residues.</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0192">The linkage of the TLR inhibitor to a lipid can be formed using standard methods. These methods include, but are not limited to the synthesis of oligonucleotide-phospholipid conjugates (Yanagawa et al. (1988) <i>Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. </i>19:189-192), oligonucleotide-fatty acid conjugates (Grabarek et al. (1990) <i>Anal. Biochem. </i>185:131-135; and Staros et al. (1986) <i>Anal. Biochem. </i>156:220-222), and oligonucleotide-sterol conjugates. Boujrad et al. (1993) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>90:5728-5731.</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0193">The linkage of the oligonucleotide to an oligosaccharide can be formed using standard known methods. These methods include, but are not limited to, the synthesis of oligonucleotide-oligosaccharide conjugates, wherein the oligosaccharide is a moiety of an immunoglobulin. O'Shannessy et al. (1985) <i>J. Applied Biochem. </i>7:347-355.</p>
      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0194">The linkage of a circular TLR inhibitor to a peptide linker can be formed in several ways. Where the circular TLR inhibitor is synthesized using recombinant or chemical methods, a modified nucleoside is suitable. Ruth (1991) in <i>Oligonucleotides and Analogues: A Practical Approach, </i>IRL Press. Standard linking technology can then be used to connect the circular TLR inhibitor to the peptide. Goodchild (1990) <i>Bioconjug. Chem. </i>1:165. Where the circular TLR inhibitor is isolated, or synthesized using recombinant or chemical methods, the linkage can be formed by chemically activating, or photoactivating, a reactive group (e.g. carbene, radical) that has been incorporated into the peptide.</p>

      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0196">A TLR inhibitor may be proximately associated in other ways. In some embodiments, a TLR inhibitor is proximately associated by encapsulation. In other embodiments, a TLR inhibitor is proximately associated by linkage to a platform molecule. A âplatform moleculeâ (also termed âplatformâ) is a molecule containing sites which allow for attachment of the TLR inhibitor. In other embodiments, a TLR inhibitor is proximately associated by adsorption onto a surface, preferably a carrier particle.</p>
      <p id="p-00233-en" num="0197">In some embodiments, the methods described herein employ an encapsulating agent in association with the TLR inhibitor. Preferably, the composition comprising TLR inhibitor and encapsulating agent is in the form of adjuvant oil-in-water emulsions, microparticles and/or liposomes. More preferably, adjuvant oil-in-water emulsions, microparticles and/or liposomes encapsulating an TLR inhibitor are in the form of particles from about 0.04 Î¼m to about 100 Î¼m in size, preferably any of the following ranges: from about 0.1 Î¼m to about 20 Î¼m; from about 0.15 Î¼m to about 10 Î¼m; from about 0.05 Î¼m to about 1.00 Î¼m; from about 0.05 Î¼m to about 0.5 Î¼m.</p>

      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0203">An optional colloidal dispersion system is a liposome. As used herein, a âliposomeâ or âlipid vesicleâ is a small vesicle bounded by at least one and possibly more than one bilayer lipid membrane. Liposomes are made artificially from phospholipids, glycolipids, lipids, steroids such as cholesterol, related molecules, or a combination thereof by any technique known in the art, including but not limited to sonication, extrusion, or removal of detergent from lipid-detergent complexes. A liposome can also optionally comprise additional components, such as a tissue targeting component. It is understood that a âlipid membraneâ or âlipid bilayerâ need not consist exclusively of lipids, but can additionally contain any suitable other components, including, but not limited to, cholesterol and other steroids, lipid-soluble chemicals, proteins of any length, and other amphipathic molecules, providing the general structure of the membrane is a sheet of two hydrophilic surfaces sandwiching a hydrophobic core. For a general discussion of membrane structure, see <i>The Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology </i>by J. Kendrew (1994). For suitable lipids see e.g., Lasic (1993) âLiposomes: from Physics to Applicationsâ Elsevier, Amsterdam.</p>
      <p id="p-00240-en" num="0204">Processes for preparing liposomes containing TLR inhibitor compositions are known in the art. The lipid vesicles can be prepared by any suitable technique known in the art. Methods include, but are not limited to, microencapsulation, microfluidization, LLC method, ethanol injection, freon injection, the âbubbleâ method, detergent dialysis, hydration, sonication, and reverse-phase evaporation. Reviewed in Watwe et al. (1995) <i>Curr. Sci. </i>68:715-724. Techniques may be combined in order to provide vesicles with the most desirable attributes.</p>
      <p id="p-00241-en" num="0205">Provided herein are uses of lipid bilayers such as liposomes containing tissue or cellular targeting components. Such targeting components enhance accumulation at certain tissue or cellular sites in preference to other tissue or cellular sites when administered to an intact animal, organ, or cell culture. A targeting component is generally accessible from outside the liposome, and is therefore preferably either bound to the outer surface or inserted into the outer lipid bilayer. A targeting component can be inter alia a peptide, a region of a larger peptide, an antibody specific for a cell surface molecule or marker, or antigen binding fragment thereof, a nucleic acid, a carbohydrate, a region of a complex carbohydrate, a special lipid, or a small molecule such as a drug, hormone, or hapten, attached to any of the aforementioned molecules. Antibodies with specificity toward cell type-specific cell surface markers are known in the art and are readily prepared by methods known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00242-en" num="0206">The liposomes can be targeted to any cell type toward which a therapeutic treatment is to be directed, e.g., a cell type which can regulate and/or participate in an immune response. Such target cells and organs include, but are not limited to, APCs, such as macrophages, dendritic cells and lymphocytes, lymphatic structures, such as lymph nodes and the spleen, and nonlymphatic structures, particularly those in which dendritic cells are found.</p>

Examples of proteinaceous platforms include, but are not limited to, albumin, gammaglobulin, immunoglobulin (IgG) and ovalbumin. Borel et al. (1990) <i>Immunol. Methods </i>126:159-168; Dumas et al. (1995) <i>Arch. Dematol. Res. </i>287:123-128; Borel et al. (1995) <i>Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. </i>107:264-267; Borel et al. (1996) <i>Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. </i>778:80-87. A platform is multi-valent (i.e., contains more than one binding, or linking, site) to accommodate binding to more than 1 TLR inhibitor. Accordingly, a platform may contain 2 or more, 3 or more, 4 or more, 5 or more, 6 or more, 7 or more, 8 or more, 9 or more, 10 or more binding or linking sites. Other examples of polymeric platforms are dextran, polyacrylamide, FICOLLÂ®, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, and poly D-glutamic acid/D-lysine.</p>
      <p id="p-00245-en" num="0209">In some embodiments, the platform is a polymer platform. In some embodiments, the polymer is dextran, polyacrylamide, FICOLLÂ®, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, or poly D-glutamic acid/D-lysine. In some embodiments, the polymeric platform is FICOLLÂ®. In some embodiments, the polymeric platform is FICOLLÂ® 400. In some embodiments, the polymeric platform is FICOLLÂ® 70. In some embodiments, the polymeric platform is FICOLLÂ® PM 70 (Poly(sucrose-co-epichlorhydrin)). In some embodiments, the polymeric platform is FICOLLÂ® PM 400. In some embodiments, any of between about 1 to about 200, about 1 to about 150, about 1 to about 125, about 1 to about 100, about 1 to about 75, about 1 to about 50, or about 1 to about 25 TLR inhibitors are linked to the polymeric platform.</p>
      <p id="p-00246-en" num="0210">The principles of using platform molecules are well understood in the art. Generally, a platform contains, or is derivatized to contain, appropriate binding sites for TLR inhibitors. In addition, or alternatively, TLR inhibitor is derivatized to provide appropriate linkage groups. For example, a simple platform is a bi-functional linker (i.e., has two binding sites), such as a peptide. Further examples are discussed below.</p>
      <p id="p-00247-en" num="0211">Platform molecules may be biologically stabilized, i.e., they exhibit an in vivo excretion half-life often of hours to days to months to confer therapeutic efficacy, and are preferably composed of a synthetic single chain of defined composition. They generally have a molecular weight in the range of about 200 to about 1,000,000, preferably any of the following ranges: from about 200 to about 500,000; from about 200 to about 200,000; from about 200 to about 50,000 (or less, such as 30,000). Examples of valency platform molecules are polymers (or are comprised of polymers) such as polyethylene glycol (PEG; preferably having a molecular weight of about 200 to about 8000), poly-D-lysine, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, D-glutamic acid and D-lysine (in a ratio of 3:2). Other molecules that may be used are albumin and IgG.</p>
      <p id="p-00248-en" num="0212">Other platform molecules suitable for use are the chemically-defined, non-polymeric valency platform molecules disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,552,391. Other homogeneous chemically-defined valency platform molecules suitable for use are derivatized 2,2â²-ethylenedioxydiethylamine (EDDA) and triethylene glycol (TEG).</p>
      <p id="p-00249-en" num="0213">Additional suitable valency platform molecules include, but are not limited to, tetraaminobenzene, heptaaminobetacyclodextrin, tetraaminopentaerythritol, 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane (Cyclam) and 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (Cyclen).</p>
      <p id="p-00250-en" num="0214">In general, these platforms are made by standard chemical synthesis techniques. PEG must be derivatized and made multivalent, which is accomplished using standard techniques. Some substances suitable for conjugate synthesis, such as PEG, albumin, and IgG are available commercially.</p>
      <p id="p-00251-en" num="0215">Conjugation of a TLR inhibitor to a platform molecule may be effected in any number of ways, typically involving one or more crosslinking agents and functional groups on the TLR inhibitor and platform molecule. Platforms and TLR inhibitor must have appropriate linking groups. Linking groups are added to platforms using standard synthetic chemistry techniques. Linking groups may be added to polypeptide platforms and TLR inhibitor using either standard solid phase synthetic techniques or recombinant techniques. Recombinant approaches may require post-translational modification in order to attach a linker, and such methods are known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00252-en" num="0216">As an example, polypeptides contain amino acid side chain moieties containing functional groups such as amino, carboxyl or sulfhydryl groups that serve as sites for coupling the polypeptide to the platform. Residues that have such functional groups may be added to the polypeptide if the polypeptide does not already contain these groups. Such residues may be incorporated by solid phase synthesis techniques or recombinant techniques, both of which are well known in the peptide synthesis arts. When the polypeptide has a carbohydrate side chain(s) (or if the platform is a carbohydrate), functional amino, sulfhydryl and/or aldehyde groups may be incorporated therein by conventional chemistry. For instance, primary amino groups may be incorporated by reaction of the oxidized sugar with ethylenediamine in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride, sulfhydryls may be introduced by reaction of cysteamine dihydrochloride followed by reduction with a standard disulfide reducing agent, while aldehyde groups may be generated following periodate oxidation. In a similar fashion, the platform molecule may also be derivatized to contain functional groups if it does not already possess appropriate functional groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00253-en" num="0217">Hydrophilic linkers of variable lengths are useful for connecting TLR inhibitors to platform molecules. Suitable linkers include linear oligomers or polymers of ethylene glycol. Such linkers include linkers with the formula R<sup>1</sup>S(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>R<sup>2 </sup>wherein n=0-200, m=1 or 2, R<sup>1</sup>âH or a protecting group such as trityl, R<sup>2</sup>âH or alkyl or aryl, e.g., 4-nitrophenyl ester. These linkers are useful in connecting a molecule containing a thiol reactive group such as haloaceyl, maleiamide, etc., via a thioether to a second molecule which contains an amino group via an amide bond. These linkers are flexible with regard to the order of attachment, i.e., the thioether can be formed first or last.</p>
      <p id="p-00254-en" num="0218">In embodiments in which TLR inhibitors are proximately associated by adsorption onto a surface, the surface may be in the form of a carrier particle (for example, a nanoparticle) made with either an inorganic or organic core. Examples of such nanoparticles include, but are not limited to, nanocrystalline particles, nanoparticles made by the polymerization of alkylcyanoacrylates and nanoparticles made by the polymerization of methylidene malonate. Additional surfaces to which an TLR inhibitor may be adsorbed include, but are not limited to, activated carbon particles and protein-ceramic nanoplates. Other examples of carrier particles are provided herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00255-en" num="0219">Adsorption of polynucleotides and polypeptides to a surface for the purpose of delivery of the adsorbed molecules to cells is well known in the art. See, for example, Douglas et al. (1987) <i>Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug. Carrier Syst. </i>3:233-261; Hagiwara et al. (1987) <i>In Vivo </i>1:241-252; Bousquet et al. (1999) <i>Pharm. Res. </i>16:141-147; and Kossovsky et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,460,831. Preferably, the material comprising the adsorbent surface is biodegradable. Adsorption of a TLR inhibitor to a surface may occur through non-covalent interactions, including ionic and/or hydrophobic interactions.</p>
      <p id="p-00256-en" num="0220">In general, characteristics of carriers such as nanoparticles, such as surface charge, particle size and molecular weight, depend upon polymerization conditions, monomer concentration and the presence of stabilizers during the polymerization process (Douglas et al., 1987). The surface of carrier particles may be modified, for example, with a surface coating, to allow or enhance adsorption of the TLR inhibitor. Carrier particles with adsorbed TLR inhibitor may be further coated with other substances. The addition of such other substances may, for example, prolong the half-life of the particles once administered to the subject and/or may target the particles to a specific cell type or tissue, as described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00257-en" num="0221">Nanocrystalline surfaces to which a TLR inhibitor may be adsorbed have been described (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,460,831). Nanocrystalline core particles (with diameters of 1 Î¼m or less) are coated with a surface energy modifying layer that promotes adsorption of polypeptides, polynucleotides and/or other pharmaceutical agents. Another adsorbent surface are nanoparticles made by the polymerization of alkylcyanoacrylates. Alkylcyanoacrylates can be polymerized in acidified aqueous media by a process of anionic polymerization. Depending on the polymerization conditions, the small particles tend to have sizes in the range of 20 to 3000 nm, and it is possible to make nanoparticles specific surface characteristics and with specific surface charges (Douglas et al., 1987). For example, oligonucleotides may be adsorbed to polyisobutyl- and polyisohexlcyanoacrylate nanoparticles in the presence of hydrophobic cations such as tetraphenylphosphonium chloride or quaternary ammonium salts, such as cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide. Oligonucleotide adsorption on these nanoparticles appears to be mediated by the formation of ion pairs between negatively charged phosphate groups of the nucleic acid chain and the hydrophobic cations. See, for example, Lambert et al. (1998) <i>Biochimie </i>80:969-976, Chavany et al. (1994) <i>Pharm. Res. </i>11:1370-1378; Chavany et al. (1992) <i>Pharm. Res. </i>9:441-449. Another adsorbent surface are nanoparticles made by the polymerization of methylidene malonate.</p>
      <p id="p-00258-en" num="0222">TLR inhibitors may be administered in the form of microcarrier (MC) complexes. Accordingly, provided herein are compositions comprising TLR inhibitor/MC complexes. TLR inhibitor/MC complexes comprise a TLR inhibitor bound to the surface of a microcarrier (i.e., the TLR inhibitor is not encapsulated in the MC), and preferably comprise multiple molecules of TLR inhibitor bound to each microcarrier. In certain embodiments, a mixture of different TLR inhibitors may be complexed with a microcarrier, such that the microcarrier is bound to more than one TLR inhibitor species. The bond between the TLR inhibitor and MC may be covalent or non-covalent. As will be understood by one of skill in the art, the TLR inhibitor may be modified or derivatized and the composition of the microcarrier may be selected and/or modified to accommodate the desired type of binding desired for TLR inhibitor/MC complex formation.</p>
      <p id="p-00259-en" num="0223">Microcarriers useful are less than about 150, 120 or 100 Î¼m in size, more commonly less than about 50-60 Î¼m in size, preferably less than about 10 Î¼m in size, and are insoluble in pure water. Microcarriers used are preferably biodegradable, although nonbiodegradable microcarriers are acceptable. Microcarriers are commonly solid phase, such as âbeadsâ or other particles, although liquid phase microcarriers such as oil in water emulsions comprising a biodegradable polymers or oils are also contemplated. A wide variety of biodegradable and nonbiodegradable materials acceptable for use as microcarriers are known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00260-en" num="0224">Microcarriers for use in the compositions or methods described herein are generally less than about 10 Î¼m in size (e.g., have an average diameter of less than about 10 Î¼m, or at least about 97% of the particles pass through a 10 Î¼m screen filter), and include nanocarriers (i.e., carriers of less than about 1 Î¼m size). Preferably, microcarriers are selected having sizes within an upper limit of about 9, 7, 5, 2, or 1 Î¼m or 900, 800, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, or 100 nm and an independently selected lower limit of about 4, 2, or 1 Î¼m or about 800, 600, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 50, 25, or 10 nm, where the lower limit is less than the upper limit. In some embodiments, the microcarriers have a size of about 1.0-1.5 Î¼m, about 1.0-2.0 Î¼m or about 0.9-1.6 Î¼m. In certain preferred embodiments, the microcarriers have a size of about 10 nm to about 5 Î¼m or about 25 nm to about 4.5 Î¼m, about 1 Î¼m, about 1.2 Î¼m, about 1.4 Î¼m, about 1.5 Î¼m, about 1.6 Î¼m, about 1.8 Î¼m, about 2.0 Î¼m, about 2.5 Î¼m or about 4.5 Î¼m.

Bioeng. </i>1996:102); and polyamides such as poly(lactic acid-co-lysine).</p>

Certain embodiments exclude gold, latex, and/or magnetic beads. In certain embodiments, the microcarriers may be made of a first material (e.g., a magnetic material) encapsulated with a second material (e.g., polystyrene).</p>
      <p id="p-00263-en" num="0227">Solid phase microspheres are prepared using techniques known in the art. For example, they can be prepared by emulsion-solvent extraction/evaporation technique. Generally, in this technique, biodegradable polymers such as polyanhydrates, poly(alkyl-cyanoacrylates) and poly(hydroxy esters), for example, poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) and poly(caprolactone), are dissolved in a suitable organic solvent, such as methylene chloride, to constitute the dispersed phase (DP) of emulsion. DP is emulsified by high-speed homogenization into excess volume of aqueous continuous phase (CP) that contains a dissolved surfactant, for example, polyvinylalcohol (PVA) or polyvinylpirrolidone (PVP). Surfactant in CP is to ensure the formation of discrete and suitably-sized emulsion droplet. The organic solvent is then extracted into the CP and subsequently evaporated by raising the system temperature. The solid microparticles are then separated by centrifugation or filtration, and dried, for example, by lyophilization or application of vacuum, before storing at 4Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00264-en" num="0228">Physico-chemical characteristics such as mean size, size distribution and surface charge of dried microspheres may be determined. Size characteristics are determined, for example, by dynamic light scattering technique and the surface charge was determined by measuring the zeta potential.</p>
      <p id="p-00265-en" num="0229">Liquid phase microcarriers include liposomes, micelles, oil droplets and other lipid or oil-based particles which incorporate biodegradable polymers or oils. In certain embodiments, the biodegradable polymer is a surfactant. In other embodiments, the liquid phase microcarriers are biodegradable due to the inclusion of a biodegradable oil such as squalene or a vegetable oil. One preferred liquid phase microcarrier is oil droplets within an oil-in-water emulsion. Preferably, oil-in-water emulsions used as microcarriers comprise biodegradable substituents such as squalene.</p>
      <p id="p-00266-en" num="0230">Covalently bonded TLR inhibitor/MC complexes may be linked using any covalent crosslinking technology known in the art. Typically, the TLR inhibitor portion will be modified, either to incorporate an additional moiety (e.g., a free amine, carboxyl or sulfhydryl group) or incorporate modified (e.g., phosphorothioate) nucleotide bases to provide a site at which the TLR inhibitor portion may be linked to the microcarrier. The link between the TLR inhibitor and MC portions of the complex can be made at the 3â² or 5â² end of the TLR inhibitor, or at a suitably modified base at an internal position in the TLR inhibitor. The microcarrier is generally also modified to incorporate moieties through which a covalent link may be formed, although functional groups normally present on the microcarrier may also be utilized. The TLR inhibitor/MC is formed by incubating the TLR inhibitor with a microcarrier under conditions which permit the formation of a covalent complex (e.g., in the presence of a crosslinking agent or by use of an activated microcarrier comprising an activated moiety which will form a covalent bond with the TLR inhibitor).</p>
      <p id="p-00267-en" num="0231">A wide variety of crosslinking technologies are known in the art, and include crosslinkers reactive with amino, carboxyl and sulfhydryl groups. As will be apparent to one of skill in the art, the selection of a crosslinking agent and crosslinking protocol will depend on the configuration of the TLR inhibitor and the microcarrier as well as the desired final configuration of the TLR inhibitor/MC complex. The crosslinker may be either homobifunctional or heterobifunctional. When a homobifunctional crosslinker is used, the crosslinker exploits the same moiety on the TLR inhibitor and MC (e.g., an aldehyde crosslinker may be used to covalently link an TLR inhibitor and MC where both the TLR inhibitor and MC comprise one or more free amines). Heterobifunctional crosslinkers utilize different moieties on the TLR inhibitor and MC, (e.g., a maleimido-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester may be used to covalently link a free sulfhydryl on the TLR inhibitor and a free amine on the MC), and are preferred to minimize formation of inter-microcarrier bonds. In most cases, it is preferable to crosslink through a first crosslinking moiety on the microcarrier and a second crosslinking moiety on the TLR inhibitor, where the second crosslinking moiety is not present on the microcarrier. One preferred method of producing the TLR inhibitor/MC complex is by âactivatingâ the microcarrier by incubating with a heterobifunctional crosslinking agent, then forming the TLR inhibitor/MC complex by incubating the TLR inhibitor and activated MC under conditions appropriate for reaction. The crosslinker may incorporate a âspacerâ arm between the reactive moieties, or the two reactive moieties in the crosslinker may be directly linked.</p>
      <p id="p-00268-en" num="0232">In one preferred variation, the TLR inhibitor portion comprises at least one free sulfhydryl (e.g., provided by a 5â²-thiol modified base or linker) for crosslinking to the microcarrier, while the microcarrier comprises free amine groups. A heterobifunctional crosslinker reactive with these two groups (e.g., a crosslinker comprising a maleimide group and a NHS-ester), such as succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate is used to activate the MC, then covalently crosslink the TLR inhibitor to form the TLR inhibitor/MC complex.</p>
      <p id="p-00269-en" num="0233">Non-covalent TLR inhibitor/MC complexes may be linked by any non-covalent binding or interaction, including ionic (electrostatic) bonds, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals attractions, or a combination of two or more different interactions, as is normally the case when a binding pair is to link the TLR inhibitor and MC.</p>
      <p id="p-00270-en" num="0234">Preferred non-covalent TLR inhibitor/MC complexes are typically complexed by hydrophobic or electrostatic (ionic) interactions, or a combination thereof, (e.g., through base pairing between a TLR inhibitor and a polynucleotide bound to an MC use of a binding pair). Due to the hydrophilic nature of the backbone of polynucleotides, TLR inhibitor/MC complexes which rely on hydrophobic interactions to form the complex generally require modification of the TLR inhibitor portion of the complex to incorporate a highly hydrophobic moiety. Preferably, the hydrophobic moiety is biocompatible, nonimmunogenic, and is naturally occurring in the individual for whom the composition is intended (e.g., is found in mammals, particularly humans). Examples of preferred hydrophobic moieties include lipids, steroids, sterols such as cholesterol, and terpenes. The method of linking the hydrophobic moiety to the TLR inhibitor will, of course, depend on the configuration of the TLR inhibitor and the identity of the hydrophobic moiety. The hydrophobic moiety may be added at any convenient site in the TLR inhibitor, preferably at either the 5â² or 3â² end; in the case of addition of a cholesterol moiety to a TLR inhibitor, the cholesterol moiety is preferably added to the 5â² end of the TLR inhibitor, using conventional chemical reactions (see, for example, Godard et al. (1995) <i>Eur. J. Biochem. </i>232:404-410). Preferably, microcarriers for use in TLR inhibitor/MC complexes linked by hydrophobic bonding are made from hydrophobic materials, such as oil droplets or hydrophobic polymers, although hydrophilic materials modified to incorporate hydrophobic moieties may be utilized as well. When the microcarrier is a liposome or other liquid phase microcarrier comprising a lumen and the TLR inhibitor is desired to be associated with the outer surface of the MC, the TLR inhibitor/MC complex is formed by mixing the TLR inhibitor and the MC after preparation of the MC, in order to avoid encapsulation of the TLR inhibitor during the MC preparation process.</p>
      <p id="p-00271-en" num="0235">Non-covalent TLR inhibitor/MC complexes bound by electrostatic binding typically exploit the highly negative charge of the polynucleotide backbone. Accordingly, microcarriers for use in non-covalently bound TLR inhibitor/MC complexes are generally positively charged (cationic) at physiological pH (e.g., about pH 6.8-7.4). The microcarrier may intrinsically possess a positive charge, but microcarriers made from compounds not normally possessing a positive charge may be derivatized or otherwise modified to become positively charged (cationic). For example, the polymer used to make the microcarrier may be derivatized to add positively charged groups, such as primary amines. Alternately, positively charged compounds may be incorporated in the formulation of the microcarrier during manufacture (e.g., positively charged surfactants may be used during the manufacture of poly(lactic acid)/poly(glycolic acid) copolymers to confer a positive charge on the resulting microcarrier particles).</p>
      <p id="p-00272-en" num="0236">For example, to prepare cationic microspheres, cationic lipids or polymers, for example, 1,2-dioleoyl-1,2,3-trimethylammoniopropane (DOTAP), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) or polylysine, are added either to DP or CP, as per their solubility in these phases.</p>
      <p id="p-00273-en" num="0237">TLR inhibitor/MC complexes can be preformed by adsorption onto cationic microspheres by incubation of polynucleotide and the particles, preferably in an aqueous admixture. Such incubation may be carried out under any desired conditions, including ambient (room) temperature (e.g., approximately 20Â° C.) or under refrigeration (e.g., 4Â° C.). Because cationic microspheres and polynucleotides associate relatively quickly, the incubation may be for any convenient time period, such as 5, 10, 15 minutes or more, including overnight and longer incubations. For example, TLR inhibitors can be adsorbed onto the cationic microspheres by overnight aqueous incubation of polynucleotide and the particles at 4Â° C. However, because cationic microspheres and polynucleotides spontaneously associate, the TLR inhibitor/MC complex can be formed by simple co-administration of the polynucleotide and the MC. Microspheres may be characterized for size and surface charge before and after polynucleotide association. Selected batches may then be evaluated for activity against suitable controls in, for example, human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and mouse splenocyte assays. The formulations may also be evaluated in suitable animal models.</p>
      <p id="p-00274-en" num="0238">Non-covalent TLR inhibitor/MC complexes linked by nucleotide base pairing may be produced using conventional methodologies. Generally, base-paired TLR inhibitor/MC complexes are produced using a microcarrier comprising a bound, preferably a covalently bound, polynucleotide (the âcapture polynucleotideâ) that is at least partially complementary to the TLR inhibitor. The segment of complementarity between the TLR inhibitor and the capture nucleotide is preferably at least 6, 8, 10 or 15 contiguous base pairs, more preferably at least 20 contiguous base pairs. The capture nucleotide may be bound to the MC by any method known in the art, and is preferably covalently bound to the TLR inhibitor at the 5â² or 3â² end.</p>
      <p id="p-00275-en" num="0239">In other embodiments, a binding pair may be used to link the TLR inhibitor and MC in an TLR inhibitor/MC complex. The binding pair may be a receptor and ligand, an antibody and antigen (or epitope), or any other binding pair which binds at high affinity (e.g., Kd less than about 10-8). One type of preferred binding pair is biotin and streptavidin or biotin and avidin, which form very tight complexes. When using a binding pair to mediate TLR inhibitor/MC complex binding, the TLR inhibitor is derivatized, typically by a covalent linkage, with one member of the binding pair, and the MC is derivatized with the other member of the binding pair. Mixture of the two derivatized compounds results in TLR inhibitor/MC complex formation.</p>

      <p id="p-00305-en" num="0269">A suitable dosage range is one that provides the desired regulation of immune response (e.g., suppression of a TLR7, TLR8, and/or TLR9 agonist or suppression of IFN or other cytokine production in response to a TLR7, TLR8, and/or TLR9 agonist). Generally, dosage is determined by the amount of the TLR inhibitor administered to the individual. Useful dosage ranges of a composition comprising a TLR inhibitor, may be, for example, any of the following: 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, 0.5 to 10 mg/kg, 1 to 10 mg/kg, 0.1 to 20 mg/kg, 0.1 to 20 mg/kg, or 1 to 20 mg/kg. The absolute amount given to each individual depends on pharmacological properties such as bioavailability, clearance rate and route of administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00306-en" num="0270">For treatment of an individual, depending on activity of the agent, manner of administration, purpose of the administration (i.e., prophylactic or therapeutic), nature and severity of the disorder, age and body weight of the individual, different doses may be necessary. Dosages are generally selected by the physician or other health care professional in accordance with a variety of parameters known in the art, such as severity of symptoms, history of the individual and the like. In some embodiments, an effective amount of the TLR inhibitor may be used in the methods described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00307-en" num="0271">The administration of a given dose can be carried out both by single administration in the form of an individual dose unit or else in several smaller dose units. Repeated and multiple administration of doses at specific intervals of days, weeks, or months apart are also contemplated.</p>
      <p id="p-00308-en" num="0272">The effective amount and method of administration of the particular TLR inhibitor formulation can vary based on the individual patient, desired result and/or type of disorder, the stage of the disease and other factors evident to one skilled in the art. The route(s) of administration useful in a particular application are apparent to one of skill in the art. Routes of administration include but are not limited to topical, dermal, transdermal, transmucosal, epidermal, parenteral, gastrointestinal, and naso-pharyngeal and pulmonary, including transbronchial and transalveolar. A suitable dosage range is one that provides sufficient TLR inhibitor-containing formulation to attain a tissue concentration of about 1-50 Î¼M as measured by blood levels. The absolute amount given to each patient depends on pharmacological properties such as bioavailability, clearance rate and route of administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00309-en" num="0273">Any one of the pharmaceutical formulations comprising a TLR inhibitor described herein may be administered by systemic (e.g., parenteral) or local (e.g., topical or intralesional injection) administration. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulation is topically, parenterally, orally, vaginally, intrauterine, intranasal, or by inhalation administered. As described herein, tissues in which unwanted immune activation is occurring or is likely to occur are preferred targets for the TLR inhibitor. Thus, administration of the TLR inhibitor to lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, blood, as well as tissue exposed to virus, are preferred sites of administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00310-en" num="0274">In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulation comprising a TLR inhibitor is administered parenterally. Parenteral routes of administration include, but are not limited to, transdermal, transmucosal, nasopharyngeal, pulmonary and direct injection. Parenteral administration by injection may be by any parenteral injection route, including, but not limited to, intravenous (IV), including bolus and infusion (e.g., fast or slow), intraperitoneal (IP), intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SC) and intradermal (ID) routes. Transdermal and transmucosal administration may be accomplished by, for example, inclusion of a carrier (e.g., dimethylsulfoxide, DMSO), by application of electrical impulses (e.g., iontophoresis) or a combination thereof. A variety of devices are available for transdermal administration which may be used. Formulations of TLR inhibitors suitable for parenteral administration are generally formulated in USP water or water for injection and may further comprise pH buffers, salts bulking agents, preservatives, and other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Immunoinhibitory polynucleotide for parenteral injection may be formulated in pharmaceutically acceptable sterile isotonic solutions such as saline and phosphate buffered saline for injection.</p>
      <p id="p-00311-en" num="0275">Transdermal administration is accomplished by application of a cream, rinse, gel, etc. capable of allowing the TLR inhibitor to penetrate the skin and enter the blood stream. Compositions suitable for transdermal administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable suspensions, oils, creams and ointments applied directly to the skin or incorporated into a protective carrier such as a transdermal device (so-called âpatchâ). Examples of suitable creams, ointments etc. can be found, for instance, in the Physician's Desk Reference. Transdermal transmission may also be accomplished by iontophoresis, for example using commercially available patches which deliver their product continuously through unbroken skin for periods of several days or more. Use of this method allows for controlled transmission of pharmaceutical compositions in relatively great concentrations, permits infusion of combination drugs and allows for contemporaneous use of an absorption promoter. Administration via the transdermal and transmucosal routes may be continuous or pulsatile.</p>
      <p id="p-00312-en" num="0276">Gastrointestinal routes of administration include, but are not limited to, ingestion and rectal routes and can include the use of, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable powders, pills or liquids for ingestion and suppositories for rectal administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00313-en" num="0277">Naso-pharyngeal and pulmonary administration include are accomplished by inhalation, and include delivery routes such as intranasal, transbronchial and transalveolar routes. Formulations of TLR inhibitors suitable for administration by inhalation including, but not limited to, liquid suspensions for forming aerosols as well as powder forms for dry powder inhalation delivery systems are provided. Devices suitable for administration by inhalation of TLR inhibitor formulations include, but are not limited to, atomizers, vaporizers, nebulizers, and dry powder inhalation delivery devices. Other methods of delivering to respiratory mucosa include delivery of liquid formulations, such as by nose drops. Administration by inhalation is preferably accomplished in discrete doses (e.g., via a metered dose inhaler), although delivery similar to an infusion may be accomplished through use of a nebulizer.</p>
      <p id="p-00314-en" num="0278">As described herein, tissues in which unwanted immune activation is occurring or is likely to occur are suitable targets for the TLR inhibitors. Thus, administration of the TLR inhibitor composition to lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, blood, as well as tissue exposed to virus, are preferred sites of administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00315-en" num="0279">As is well known in the art, solutions or suspensions used for the routes of administration described herein can include any one or more of the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.</p>
      <p id="p-00316-en" num="0280">As is well known in the art, pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor ELâ¢ (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. It may be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</p>
      <p id="p-00317-en" num="0281">As is well known in the art, sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound(s) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.</p>

      <p id="p-00343-en" num="0306">A PN-based TLR7 ligand stabilized immunomodulatory RNA (5â²-URCURCUUCUR-/glycerol/-RUCUUCRUCRU-5â² with R=7-deazaguanosine, hereinafter âTLR7 agonistâ set forth as SEQ ID NO:2-/glycerol/-SEQ ID NO:117) and a PN-based TLR8 ligand stabilized immunomodulatory RNA (5â²-M2UGCUGCUUGUG-/glycerol/-GUGUUCGUCGUM2-5â² with M2=C6-linker, hereinafter ORN8L or âTLR8 agonistâ set forth as SEQ ID NO:3-/glycerol/-SEQ ID NO:118) were previously described (Lan et al., PNAS, 104:13750-13755, 2007). The effect of the TLR7- and TLR8-stimulating RNA PN was evaluated by measuring production of IL-6 and TNF-Î± in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and human monocytes. About 5Ã10<sup>5 </sup>PBMCs or 2Ã10<sup>5 </sup>monocytes from human healthy donors were stimulated with 20 Î¼g/mL, 100 Î¼g/mL, or 200 Î¼g/mL of either TLR8 agonist or TLR7 agonist. Twenty-four hours later supernatants were assessed for inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-Î± by a standard ELISA procedure. TLR7 and TLR8 agonists stimulated production of IL-6 and TNF-Î± in PBMCs and, to a lesser extent, in monocytes.</p>
      <p id="p-00344-en" num="0307">The effect of TLR7 and TLR8-stimulating RNA PN were also evaluated in human pDCs, which are TLR8-negative, by measuring production of IL-6, TNF-Î±, and IFN-Î±. About 1Ã10<sup>5 </sup>pDCs from human healthy donors were stimulated with 100 Î¼g/mL of either TLR8 agonist or TLR7 agonist (Lan et al., PNAS, 104:13750-13755, 2007) or medium alone. Twenty-four hours later supernatants were assessed for inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-Î±, and IFN-Î±, by a standard ELISA procedure. The TLR7 agonist but not the TLR8 agonist stimulated production of IL-6, TNF-Î±, and IFN-Î± by human pDCs. Thus the TLR8 agonist is specific for TLR8.</p>
      <p id="p-00345-en" num="0308">The effect of TLR7 and TLR8-stimulating RNA PNs was further evaluated in mouse cells by measuring IL-12 and TNF-Î± production. Mouse splenocytes and PBMCs were prepared from 129S2/SvPasCrl wild type mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass.) and TLR7KO mice. About 5Ã10<sup>5 </sup>cells were stimulated with 100 Î¼g/ml of either TLR8 agonist or TLR7 agonist. IL-12 and TNF-Î± were measured by ELISA using standard techniques. The TLR7 agonist but not the TLR8 agonist stimulated production of IL-12 and TNF-Î±, by mouse splenocytes and PBMCs.</p>

      <p id="p-00348-en" num="0310">For assays with enough titration points, generally a minimum of about 10 over three orders of magnitude, IC50 values (half maximal inhibitory concentration) were calculated using GraphPad Prizm 5 software. Because these assays use primary cells, there was some donor variation in the response to both the agonist used for stimulation and the TLR inhibitors. Therefore, while qualitative comparisons were made between assays using different donors, quantitative comparisons were made only for PN that were tested with the same set of donors.</p>

Concentrations of the test polynucleotides ranged from 0.002 Î¼M to 1 Î¼M, although not all concentrations were used in all experiments. At 16-18 hours, supernatants were collected and levels of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-6 were measured by ELISA. The inhibitory responses of the PN determined from measuring TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-6 levels showed the same trend, and therefore not all cytokines were measured for each experiment.</p>

      <heading id="h-00028-en" level="1">TLR7 Inhibitors Do Not Necessarily Inhibit TLR8</heading>
      <p id="p-00361-en" num="0322">Known TLR7 inhibitors were tested in the TLR7- and TLR8-specific inhibition assays described in Example 3. As expected, C954, DV197 and DV134 at a concentration of 30 nM all showed good inhibition of TLR7-mediated IFN-Î± production in PDC stimulated with 2 MOI inactivated influenza virus (<figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>). However, only DV197 showed good inhibition of TLR8-mediated TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² production in monocytes stimulated with ORN8L (<figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>). Previously, 5â²-TGC and 5â²-ugc were reported to be TLR7/8 inhibitory motifs (see, e.g., U.S. Pub. No. 2007/0238678; and U.S. Pub. No. 2011/0003885). Additionally, 3â²-GT and 3â²-gu, where G is guanine or 7-deazaguanosine, were previously reported to be TLR8 inhibitory motifs (see, e.g., U.S. Pub. No. 2005/0239733). Thus it was surprising to learn during development of the present disclosure, that these putative TLR8 motifs are not sufficient for TLR8 inhibition. Specifically, DV197, but not C954, DV134 and DVX10, contains a 3â²-GI at the 3â²-end of the PN. Accordingly, as demonstrated herein, 3â²-GT and 3â²-gu are not sufficient for TLR8 inhibition. Additionally, although DV197, C954, DV134 and DVX10 all contain a 5â²-TGC or 5â²-ugc, only DV197 is a potent TLR8 inhibitor (<figref>FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>). Accordingly as demonstrated herein, 5â²-TGC or 5â²-ugc are not sufficient for TLR8 inhibition.</p>

      <p id="p-00362-en" num="0323">Human TLR8 transgenic mice were generated as previously described (International App. No. PCT/US2012/031307). Chimeric mice of clone 8, having 1-2 copies of hTLR8 integrated into the genome, were able to breed and pass germline transmission. Therefore, TLR8Tg Clone 8 mice were used for further studies.</p>
      <p id="p-00363-en" num="0324">TLR8Tg Clone 8 mice were injected with 300 mcg of ORN8L (TLR8 agonist) intravenously, alone or in combination with DV197 (100 mcg), which was administered subcutaneously. After 6 hours, mice were bled and IL-12 was measured by ELISA. As shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, DV197 is able to inhibit TLR8 activation in vivo.</p>

      <p id="p-00364-en" num="0325">DV197 analogs containing A, T, G, or C instead of I at the 3â²-end (DVX1, DVX2, DVX3 and DVX4, respectively) were tested in the TLR8-specific inhibitory assay described in Example 3. As shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the 3â²-nucleotide is critical for TLR8 inhibitory activity with 3â²-I or 3â²-A being the most active. DVX5, which contains GGGI at the 3â²-end instead of GAGI like DV197, also retained TLR8 inhibitory activity (Ë90% inhibition at 0.75 Î¼M).</p>

      <p id="p-00365-en" num="0326">DV197 analogs containing different amounts of 2â²-O-methyl RNA modifications at the 5â²-end (DVX6, DVX7, DVX8, DVX9, DVX24, DVX25 and DVX26) were tested in the TLR8-specific inhibitory assay described in Example 3. As shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref> and <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, DVX8 and DVX26, which contain only DNA nucleotides, show that 2â²-O-methyl RNA is not required for TLR8 inhibitory activity. Additionally, chimeric 2â²-O-methyl RNA/DNA PN have TLR8 inhibitory activity, although full modification to 2â²-O-methyl RNA, as in DVX25, reduces TLR8 inhibitory activity.</p>

      <heading id="h-00036-en" level="1">Effect of Additions and Deletions From 3â²-End on TLR8 Inhibitory Activity</heading>
      <p id="p-00366-en" num="0327">DV197 analogs with 1, 2 or 3 thymidine (T) nucleotides added to the 3â²-end (DVX11, DVX12, and DVX13, respectively) or with 1, 2 or 3 nucleotide deletions from the 3â²-end (DVX14, DVX15 and DVX16) were tested in the TLR8-specific inhibitory assay described in Example 3. As shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, one (1) nucleotide may be added to the 3â²-end with little loss of TLR8 inhibitory activity. Moreover, the deletion series demonstrates that a 3â²-A is preferred over a 3â²-G for TLR8 inhibitory activity (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>). These results confirm the importance of the 3â²-end for TLR8 inhibitory activity.</p>

      <p id="p-00369-en" num="0329">Replacement of the G in either the DV197 or DVX8 sequence with I resulted in PN with similar or increased TLR8 inhibitory activity. On the other hand, PN with A, C, or T replacements in the DVX8 sequence were inactive (<figref>FIG. 10</figref> and Table 10-1, Experiment A).</p>
      <p id="p-00370-en" num="0330">DVX26 analogs containing 5â²-TIC, 5â²-TAC, 5â²-TTC, or 5â²-TCC instead of a 5â²-TGC, all showed similar TLR8 inhibitory activity confirming that 5â²-TGC is not required for TLR8 inhibition. These results also confirmed that the 5â²-end of the PN is not important for TLR8 inhibitory activity (Table 10-1, Experiment B).</p>
      <p id="p-00371-en" num="0331">Additionally, Experiments C through G of Table 10-1 evaluated the importance of the four nucleotides at the 3â²-end for TLR8 inhibitory activity. These results, in combination with previous observations made during development of the present disclosure, show that PN with an II, IA, GI or GA at the 3â²-end had good TLR8 inhibitory activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00372-en" num="0332">Experiments H through J of Table 10-1 evaluated the importance of the middle nucleotides for TLR8 inhibitory activity, while maintaining an II at the 3â²-end of the PN. All PN tested in these experiments had TLR8 inhibitory activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00373-en" num="0333">Experiment K of Table 10-1 evaluated the minimum length for the PN to maintain TLR8 inhibitory activity. DVX61 is a 6-mer containing an II at the 3â²-end, which showed good TLR8 inhibitory activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00374-en" num="0334">Experiments L, N and O of Table 10-1 evaluated the TLR8 inhibitory activity of a variety of 18-mers to 21-mers containing an II at the 3â²-end. All PN tested in this experiment had good TLR8 inhibitory activity. Some differences were observed, however, indicating that the other nucleotides in the PN can have an effect on TLR8 inhibitory activity. Additionally, DVX86, DVX96, DVX97, DVX98, DVX99, DVX100 and DVX101 were designed so that a TLR8 inhibitory motif would be regenerated as the PN is degraded in vivo by 3â²-exonucleoases. For instance, each of these PN has the sequence 5â²-IIAII-3â² at the 3â²-end. Sequential degradation by 3â²-exonucleases would leave the following sequences at the 3â²-end of the PN: 5â²-IIAI-3â², 5â²-IIA-3â², and 5â²-II-3â². Of these, all except for 5â²-IIAI-3â² are TLR8 inhibitory motifs. It is expected that the half-life of the TLR8 inhibition for PN that are designed to regenerate a TLR8 inhibitory motif during in vivo degradation by 3â²-exonucleases will be longer than for PN that only contain a single TLR8 inhibitory motif.</p>
      <p id="p-00375-en" num="0335">Experiments P and Q of Table 10-1 evaluated the TLR8 inhibitory activity of additional polynucleotides containing TLR8 inhibitory motifs. DVX102, DVX103, DVX104, DVX105, DVX106, DVX107, DVX108 and DVX109 all showed good TLR8 inhibitory activity.</p>

      <p id="p-00376-en" num="0336">As determined during development of the present disclosure, the TLR7 and TLR8 inhibitory motifs are different. Therefore, PN can be designed to have TLR7-only, TLR8-only or TLR7/8 inhibitory activity by inclusion or exclusion of unique motifs. To demonstrate this, PN containing only TLR7, only TLR8 or both TLR7 and TLR8 motifs were tested in the TLR7-specific and TLR8-specific inhibitory assays described in Example 3.</p>
      <p id="p-00377-en" num="0337">As described in Example 5, C954 and DV134, which contain a TLR7 but not a TLR8 inhibitory motif, have only TLR7 inhibitory activity. Experiment M of Table 10-1 and <figref>FIG. 9</figref> show that DVX89, DVX90 and DVX92 have TLR7 and TLR8 inhibitory activity, while DVX91 and DVX93 have only TLR8 inhibitory activity. Similarly, Experiments A and B of Table 10-1 and <figref>FIG. 10</figref> show that DVX35 has TLR7 and TLR8 inhibitory activity, while DVX42 has only TLR8 inhibitory activity. Retention of TLR8 inhibitory activity was expected because DVX89, DVX90, DVX91, DVX92, DVX93, DVX35 and DVX42 all contained a TLR8 inhibitory motif (II or GI at the 3â² end). In contrast, 5â²-TIC and 5â²-TTC, were found to be TLR7 inhibitory motifs. The latter observation is surprising because previous work had described 5â²-TGC, but not 5â²-TIC or 5â²-TTC as TLR7 inhibitory motifs. Description of two new TLR7 inhibitory motifs was made possible during development of the present disclosure in part through the use of human PBMC stimulated with a selective TLR7 agonist (influenza virus), as opposed to mouse splenocytes stimulated with a non-specific TLR7/8 agonist, R848. This highlights the importance of testing TLR8 inhibitors in cells expressing human TLR8.</p>
      <p id="p-00378-en" num="0338">Additional PN that contain both TLR7 and TLR8 inhibitory motifs, such as DV197 and DVX81 among many others, were also shown to have TLR7/8 inhibitory activity (<figref>FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, <b>11</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>, and Table 10-1 Experiments L, N, O, and P). DVX81 had an IC50 of 12 nM in the TLR7 inhibitory assay, and IC50s of 26 nM (TNFÎ±) and 58 nM (IL-1Î²) respectively in the TLR8-specific inhibitory assays. Further exemplary TLR7/8 inhibitors are: 5â²-TIC TCC TTG AGI AII-3â² (DVX103; SEQ ID NO:108); 5â²-TIC TCC TCC TTG AGI AII-3â² (DVX104, SEQ ID NO:109); 5â²-TIC TTC TCC TTG AGI AII-3â² (DVX105, SEQ ID NO:110); and 5â²-TIC TCC TCC TTG IIA II-3â² (DVX106, SEQ ID NO:111), as shown in Experiment P of Table 10-1 and <figref>FIG. 23</figref>.</p>

      <p id="p-00380-en" num="0340">The selectivity of the TLR7/8 inhibitory response was demonstrated by evaluation of DVX81 in a TLR9-specific inhibitory assay using B cells, as described in Example 3.

      <p id="p-00383-en" num="0343">About 7Ã10<sup>5 </sup>PBMC cells from three healthy donors were incubated in 200 Î¼L of medium with 30 Î¼L of plasma from three rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients or plasma from three normal individuals in absence or presence of a TLR inhibitor at 1 micromolar concentration. Supernatants were evaluated by ELISA for IL-8 concentration after 16-18 hrs. The inhibitors tested were DV197 (TLR 7/8 inhibitor) and DVX42 (TLR8-only inhibitor).</p>
      <p id="p-00384-en" num="0344">As shown in <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, plasma from the RA patients stimulates IL-8, while the plasma from normal individuals does not. The IL-8 stimulation by the RA patient plasma was inhibited by both DV197 and DVX42. DV197, which contains both the TLR7 and TLR8 inhibitory motifs, inhibited IL-8 secretion to a greater extent than did DVX42. These results demonstrate that stimulation of healthy PBMC with RA patient plasma is both TLR7 and TLR8-dependent.</p>
      <p id="p-00385-en" num="0345">A second study was performed as described above, except that plasma from eight individual RA patients was used for the stimulation and DVX81 (TLR7/8 inhibitor) was used as the inhibitor.

Purity was routinely over 98%. About 3Ã10<sup>5 </sup>cells were incubated in complete medium (RPMI, 10% FBS) in the presence of 15% synovial fluid (SF) from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients alone or in combination with DV197 (1 Î¼M). Synovial fluids were obtained from ProteoGenex (Culver City, Calif.). After 14-16 hours, supernatants were assayed for cytokine levels by Milliplex (Millipore). Data are expressed as percent cytokine level of synovial fluid alone, with the average levels for each cytokine indicated above SF bars.

      <p id="p-00390-en" num="0350">For the human B-cell assay, B-cells were purified from blood cells obtained from healthy donors using magnetic beads (CD19 positive). Cells were resuspended in fresh medium (RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/mL penicillin, 50 Î¼g/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine). The cells were then incubated with 0.015 Î¼M to 4.0 Î¼M of the indicated polynucleotides. At 48 hours, supernatants were collected and IL-6 was measured by immunoassay. The polynucleotides tested were C954, DV185, DVX81, DVX82, DVX98, DVX99, DVX42, DVX102 and DVX103. C954 is known to stimulate low levels of IL-6, while DV 185 is known to stimulate high levels of IL-6. The amount of IL-6 induced by each polynucleotide was divided by that induced by C954 to determine the magnitude of IL-6 induction relative to C954.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 17</figref>, <figref>FIG. 18</figref> and <figref>FIG. 19</figref> show that different polynucleotides induce a range of IL-6 responses from human B cells. As expected, DV185 induced significantly more IL-6 than C954. Surprisingly, DVX82 induced significantly less IL-6 than DVX81, despite having the same TLR7/8 motifs, phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages and number of nucleotides. DVX82, DVX98, DVX99, DVX42, DVX102 and DVX103 induced low levels of IL-6 from human B cells.

      <p id="p-00401-en" num="0361">Polynucleotides (C954, DVX82, DVX98, DVX99, DVX102 and DVX103) at high dosages (100 mg/kg) or a control (saline) were subcutaneously administered to BALB/c mice twice a week for two weeks (n=6 per group). Polynucleotides were administered on days 2, 5, 9 and 12. Mice were weighed prior to administration (day 0), and thereafter as indicated in <figref>FIGS. 26A and 26B</figref>. Organs were harvested at the end of the study, and organ weights were determined. In addition, histological evaluation of the kidney was performed for C954-, DVX99- and DVX103-treated mice.</p>
      <p id="p-00402-en" num="0362">Mice treated with DVX102, DVX103 or C954 showed either no change in body weight or a slight increase in body weight, while mice treated with DVX82, DVX98 or DVX99 showed significant loss in body weight during the study (<figref>FIG. 26</figref>). The mice treated with C954, DVX102 or DVX103 appeared normal, while mice treated with DVX82, DVX98 or DVX99 appeared slightly scruffy at the end of the study, with DVX98-treated mice showing the worst effect. Organ weights of mice of all of the groups did not increase. However, the livers and kidneys of mice treated with DVX82, DVX98 or DVX99 were paler than normal. A summary of the severity score of kidney tubular changes and percent of weight change from Day 15 compared to Day 1 is shown in Table 20-1 for C954-, DVX99- and DVX103-treated mice. Renal changes were noted in all examined animals and were characterized by tubular changes, primarily in subcapsular regions, consisting of: cytoplasmic vacuolation; presence of amorphous eosinophilic material in tubular lumens; slight enlargement of nuclei with slight tinctorial changes of affected cells. Tubular changes were minimal (1.0) in mice receiving saline, and increased slightly in all other groups.</p>

      <p id="p-00408-en" num="0366">The human TLR8Tg Clone 8 mice, described in Example 6, develop pancreatitis, in part as indicated by inflammatory genes expressed at high levels in the pancreas. The pancreas was isolated at necropsy and RNA was isolated with Qiagen Midi Rneasy extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was generated from RNA with the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) and a TAQMAN assay was used to evaluate the gene expression level. <figref>FIG. 29</figref> shows the increase in (CT) in hTLR8, mIFN-Î³, mTNF-Î±, mIL-18, mIL-12p40, mIL-1Î±, mMMP9 and mIP-10 levels in the pancreas from human TLR8Tg Clone 8 mice relative to wild type mice.</p>

      <p id="p-00411-en" num="0369">Anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by anti-phospholipid antibodies, which include antibodies directed against phospholipid-associated proteins such as cardiolipin, Î²2-glycoprotein-1 and the endosomal lipid lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA). Primary human monocytes were stimulated with 0.1 Î¼g/mL, 0.5 Î¼g/mL, 1 Î¼g/mL or 5 Î¼g/mL of a commercially available anti-LBPA antibody (clone 6C4; echelon) (Kobayashi et al, Nature, 392:193-197, 1998). After 6 hours or overnight (ON), supernatants were collected and levels of TNF-Î± and IL-6 were measured by ELISA. <figref>FIGS. 32A and 32B</figref> show that anti-LBPA induces production of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-Î± and IL-6 by human monocytes.</p>
      <p id="p-00412-en" num="0370">In a second experiment, primary human monocytes were stimulated with 1 Î¼g/mL of the clone 6C4 anti-LBPA antibody alone or in combination with 1 micromolar of DVX82 (exemplary TLR7/8 inhibitor). After overnight incubation, supernatants were collected and levels of TNF-Î± and IL-6 were measured by ELISA. <figref>FIGS. 33A and 33B</figref> show that DVX82 reduced IL-6 and TNF levels induced by anti-LBPA in human monocytes. These results show that anti-LBPA stimulation is at least partially TLR7/8 dependent.</p>

Supernatants are evaluated by ELISA for IFN-Î±, TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-1Î² and/or IL-8 concentration(s). It is expected that serum from the MCTD patients will stimulate cytokine production, while the serum from normal individuals will not. It is also expected that the MCTD serum-induced cytokine production will be inhibited by TLR7 and/or TLR8 inhibitors.</p>

      <p id="p-00415-en" num="0373">SjÃ¶gren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by progressive mononuclear cell infiltration within exocrine glands. Dryness of the mouth (xerostomia) and eyes (keratoconjunctivitissicca) are the main organ-related clinical features affecting these patients. SjÃ¶gren's syndrome is characterized by the presence of RNP autoantibodies, such as anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB. There is a clear association of SjÃ¶gren's syndrome with TLR7 activation of PDC and with increased Type I IFN produced by infiltrating PDC (B{dot over (a)}ve et al., Arthritis Rheum 2005, 52:1185-95, 2005; and Gottenberg et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103:2770-5, 2006). The anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB autoantibodies also activate TLR8. In fact, TLR8 is also overexpressed in the salivary glands of these patients.</p>

      <p id="p-00417-en" num="0375">Human TLR8Tg Clone 12 mice express a high level of human TLR8 and develop spontaneous severe salivary gland inflammation, and pancreas, kidney and joint disease. Human TLR8Tg Clone 8 express a lower level of human TLR8 and still develop spontaneous pancreas and salivary gland inflammation, although other organs are not significantly affected. Human TLR8Tg Clone 12 or Clone 8 are injected with multiple doses of a TLR7 and/or TLR8 and/or TLR9 inhibitor or PBS using a defined treatment schedule. Levels of inflammatory genes in the salivary glands, kidney and/or joints are determined using TAQMAN. Genes that may be monitored include IL-1Î², IL-6, IL-10, TNF-Î±, IL1Î±, IL12p40, mTLR9, MAC1, TLR7, human TLR8, IP-10, MMP9, IFN-g, MMP3, IL1-RAIL-23, Lta, MIP3a, MIP3B, MIG, MMP8, MMP10CD4, CD8, CCR2, CCR6, MPO, NOS2, MMP12, TLR2, MMP1, and MMP7. TLR inhibitor-treated hTLR8Tg Clone 12 or Clone 8 mice are expected to show a decrease in the levels of inflammatory genes in the target organs compared to the levels found in PBS-treated hTLR8Tg Clone 12 or Clone 8 mice. Additionally, the histopathology on the target organs from the human TLR8Tg Clone 12 or Clone 8 mice treated with a TLR inhibitor are expected to show a reduced disease score relative to those treated with PBS only.</p>

      <p id="p-00418-en" num="0376">6-Sulpho LacNAc dendritic cells (slanDC) account for the majority of dendritic cells (DC) in human blood and are highly pro-inflammatory, as characterized by their capacity to produce TNF-Î±, IL-23, IL-6, IL-1Î± and I-1Î² (Schakel et al., Immunity, 25:767, 2006). slanDC are promptly recruited in inflamed tissue (Hansel et al., J Allergy Clin Immun, 127:787, 2011). SlanDCs infiltrate the dermis of patients with psoriasis vulgaris, atopic dermatitis (AD), cutaneous lupus and in the pannus tissue of rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
      <p id="p-00419-en" num="0377">SlanDCs co-express both TLR7 and TLR8, while the other type of myeloid DC in human CD1c+DC express only TLR8 (Hansel et al., Autoimmunity, 40:1-8, 2013). SlanDCs become activated via TLR7 and TLR8 by LL37-RNA complexes, which are largely present in psoriatic and cutaneous-lupus skin and produce high level of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Î±, IL-23, IL-6 (Hansel, supra). These LL37-RNA complexes are thought to be central in the pathogenesis of cutaneous disease such as psoriasis and cutaneous lupus (Ganguly et al., J Exp Med, 206:1983, 2009; and Gilliet et al., Nat Rev Immun, 8:594, 2008).</p>
      <p id="p-00420-en" num="0378">SlanDC purified from healthy donors are stimulated with LL37-RNA complexes alone or in the presence of TLR7, TLR8 and/or TLR7/TLR8 inhibitors. Supernatants are evaluated by ELISA for TNF-Î±, IL-23 and/or IL-6 concentration(s). It is expected that both TLR7 and TLR8 mono-functional inhibitors will decrease the response to LL37-RNA complexes and the bifunctional TLR7/8 inhibitor will more potently decrease the response than the single combinations.</p>

      <p id="p-00421-en" num="0379">Tape stripping in mice provokes an inflammatory response that is dependent on TLR7 and TLR9 (Guiducci et al., J Exp Med, 207:2931-2942, 2010). To determine the contribution of human TLR8 in skin inflammation, hTLR8Tg Clone 8 mice are treated with a TLR7, TLR8, and/or TLR9 monofunctional inhibitor, and/or a TLR7/9 and/or TLR7/8 bifunctional inhibitor, and/or aTLR7/8/9 trifunctional inhibitor subcutaneously and immediately after, the mice are tape stripped. A group of mice is left untreated to serve as controls. Skin biopsies are sampled 24 hours after tape stripping and gene expression of Type I IFN regulated genes and inflammatory genes are evaluated by TAQMAN analysis. The contribution of the inflammatory response on TLR8 is determined by comparing the results using the different TLR inhibitors. It is expected that this immune response is at least in part mediated by TLR8 and that administration of a TLR8 inhibitor will cause a reduction expression of the Type I IFN regulated and inflammatory genes.</p>

      <p id="p-00427-en" num="0385">Polynucleotides (C954, DVX103, DVX104, and DVX105) at high dosages (hi=40 mg/kg) or low dosages (lo=10 mg/kg) were subcutaneously administered to Sprague Dawley rats once a week for eight weeks (n=5 per group). Rats were weighed prior to administration (day 0), and thereafter as indicated in Table 30-1. Organs were harvested at the end of the study, and organ weights were determined. In addition, histological evaluation of the liver and kidney was performed. C954 was included in the study as a historical control and is representative of a polynucleotide with a good toxicology profile.</p>
      <p id="p-00428-en" num="0386">Rats treated with C954, DVX103, DVX104 or DVX105 showed similar increases in body weight. Organ weights of animals of all groups were similar. A summary of the severity scores reflecting changes in the liver and kidney are shown in Table 30-1. The histopathology exam of the organs confirmed the kidney as the target organ. Hepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis is not uncommon in rats. As this was observed in all groups, including the PBS-treated group, it was not considered a significant polynucleotide-related finding. No other significant changes were observed in the liver. In the kidney, mild tubular changes were found in most groups. All of the polynucleotides tested in this chronic setting showed mild changes in the kidney at the high dose (40 mg/kg, severity score about 2), while minimal changes were observed at the low dose (10 mg/kg).</p>

      <p id="p-00430-en" num="0387">Wild-type (C57BL/6) and TLR8 transgenic mice (TLR8TGCL8 described in WO 2012/135549) were immunized per a published immunization schedule and protocol (Campbell, Eur J Immunol 30:1568-1575, 2000). On day 0 of collagen immunization, collagen (chicken Type II collagen from Chondrex; 2 mg/mL) was emulsified with Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA from Chondrex containing 5 mg/mL <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </i>H37Ra) as follows: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>(i) one volume of CFA was mixed with an equal amount of the collagen solution;</li><li>(ii) mixing was continued until a stable, stiff emulsion resulted;</li><li>(iii) to ascertain the desired stability of the emulsion, 1 drop of emulsion was added into a water-filled beaker (the emulsion was considered stable if it remained in the water as a solid); and</li><li>(iv) 100 Î¼l was injected subcutaneously at the base of the tail.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00431-en" num="0392">A second injection was administered on day 21. Animals were assessed for redness and swelling of the limbs and the cumulative score of each mouse was the sum of the score obtained for each of the four limbs. The Clinical Score Guidelines were as follows: 0-Normal; 1-Mild, but definite redness and swelling of the ankle or wrist, or apparent redness and swelling limited to individual digits, regardless of the number of affected digits; 2-Moderate redness and swelling of ankle of wrist; 3-Severe redness and swelling of the entire paw including digits; and 4-Maximally inflamed limb with involvement of multiple joints and a clinical score allocated.</p>
      <p id="p-00432-en" num="0393">hTLR8TgCL8 mice were treated with either PBS or TLR7/8 inhibitor DVX105 (1 mg/kg subcutaneous) on days â1, 7, 14, 20, 24, 28, 31, 35, 42, 49 and 53. As shown in <figref>FIG. 36</figref>, the disease score in hTLR8TgCL8 mice was greatly exacerbated as compared to that of wild type (WT) mice. Treatment of the hTLR8TgCL8 mice with DVX105 decreased the disease score. This study demonstrates that hTLR8 plays a role in the exacerbation of arthritis and that a TLR7/8 inhibitor decreases arthritis in subjects that express hTLR8.</p>

      <heading id="h-00082-en" level="1">Stimulation of Human Monocytes with Serum from Sjogren's Syndrome Sjogren's syndrome Patients is TLR7/8-Dependent</heading>
      <p id="p-00433-en" num="0394">CD14+ monocytes were isolated from buffy coats using a negative selection kit (Stem Cell, Catalog No. 14068) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purity was routinely over 98%. About 3Ã10<sup>5 </sup>cells were incubated in complete medium (RPMI, 10% FBS), alone or in combination with TLR7/8 inhibitor DVX99 (1 Î¼M), in the presence of 7.5% serum from healthy subjects (n=3) or Sjogren's Syndrome patients with active disease (n=5). Serum from Sjogren's Syndrome patients was obtained from Newcastle University (UK). After 14-16 hours, supernatants were assayed for cytokine levels by Milliplex (Millipore). As shown in <figref>FIG. 38</figref>, the serum from the Sjogren's Syndrome patients stimulates IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, GM-CSF and G-CSF production, and this cytokines production can be inhibited by the TLR7/8 inhibitor DVX99.</p>
