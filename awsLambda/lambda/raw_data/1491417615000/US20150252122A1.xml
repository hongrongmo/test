      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a process to make an infusible polyolefin, that is, a polyolefin suitable for making a carbon fiber by being carbonized at elevated temperatures utilizing known carbonation processes and apparatus without decomposing and melting. Advantageously, the process of the present invention minimizes the release of polluting wastes, such as, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxides and further advantageously reduces the quantity of dilute acid streams, such as sulfuric acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Background</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Carbon and graphite fibers are increasingly used in the manufacture of components for lightweight aircraft, aerospace structures, automobile parts, and sporting equipment. Carbon fiber generally refers to a bundle of 1000 to 48,000 filaments of 6-12 micron each, where each filament is composed of &gt;96% carbon in a predominately graphene structure. Carbon fiber possesses both tensile strength and stiffness at a low density to provide composites with thermoset or thermoplastic resins with structural properties similar to heavier materials such as high strength steel, and aluminum.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">There are several known methods of producing carbon shaped articles, such as carbon fibers. Representative methods include using pitch as a raw material. Carbonaceous material is typically melted, spun into thread or filament form, and converted to a carbon or graphite fiber. The spun filament or filaments are stabilized, i.e. rendered infusible, through a heat treatment in an oxidizing atmosphere, and thereafter heated to a higher temperature in an inert atmosphere to convert the infusible filament into a carbon or graphite fiber. A large percentage of commercial carbon fiber processes employ mesophase pitch as the carbon source or graphite fiber. The pitch is formed into a fibrous shape by melt spinning. The fibers are then subjected to infusibilization treatment and then carbonized using known heat treatments. For example, a characteristic feature of producing the carbon fibers from pitch is that natural or synthetic organic compounds are baked at a temperature of from 300Â° to 500Â° C. in an inert gas atmosphere to obtain a pitch substance in a molten state. The molten pitch substance is then subjected to melt spinning to form a fiber or strand. The spun filaments are then oxidized to infusibilize so the individual filament may not be fused together by further heat-treatment. The infusibilize filaments are then subjected to carbonization, followed by, if necessary, a graphitization treatment, thereby obtaining the carbonaceous or graphitic fibers. In such an example, the melt spinning is carried out by using the raw material pitch of a particular class having a mean molecular weight of 400 or above. The high cost of the graphite fibers produced is due primarily to the cost of producing the mesophase pitch as the base of such fiber manufacture. Further, most of the commercial fibers produced from mesophase pitch have been fibers that have been subsequently converted to graphite fibers.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In another process, the fibers derived from natural or synthetic high polymer materials such as polyacrylonitrile, polybenzimidasole, and cellulose are baked. Carbon fiber bodies are typically formed from carbon fiber body precursors, such as, for example, preoxidized polyacrylonitrile (PAN) which is commonly used as a carbon fiber body precursor. Carbon fiber body precursors may be manipulated and fabricated in a manner similar to a textile (e.g., weaving, knitting, etc) to form desired structures. To transform the carbon fiber body precursor into a carbon fiber body, various methods and techniques may be used. For example, during transformation of PAN materials, the PAN fiber may be carbonized and then processed to eliminate metals or other impurities that may be found in the PAN fiber.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Transformation of carbon fiber body precursors, such as PAN fibers and preformed articles, often occurs in a two-stage process. The first stage may be a carbonization stage. A carbonization stage is typically performed at temperatures of less than 1100Â° C., and most typically between about 800Â° C. and 950Â° C. The second stage may be a high temperature stage, typically using temperatures over 1400Â° C. A large portion of the PAN fiber is removed as cyanide in this process which must be treated before disposal, typically with an energy intensive thermal oxidation.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In another process carbon fibers have been prepared from polyethylene fiber by liquid immersion sulfonation of the polyethylene fiber (e.g., by treatment with chlorosulfonic or sulfuric acid), followed by pyrolysis. The sulfonation step makes the polyethylene fiber thermally infusible, and thus, carbonizable at the high temperatures employed for carbonization. However, the liquid immersion sulfonation process, as conventionally practiced, has a drawback of being either very slow with respect to the degree of sulfonation provided to the polyethylene fiber, or very aggressive such that the reaction is uncontrollable before it achieves equilibrium or complete sulfonation (i.e., a saturated level of sulfonation) of the precursor fiber. Although not to be bound by any theory, it is believed that physical and chemical changes that occur on the polymer surface during the reactions just described, leads to dehydrogenation with the formation of olefinic bonds.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Another problem associated with preparing an infusible polymer using a polyolefin is evolution of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide during the reaction between concentrated sulfuric acid with polyolefins, oleum with polyolefins or sulfur trioxide with polyolefins.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Accordingly, there is a need for a process for preparing an infusible polyolefin using a sulfoxide that addresses the problems described above.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Advantageously, the inventors have discovered a process for making polyolefins infusible, i.e., able to be carbonized without decomposing and melting, that proceeds quicker and at lower temperatures than other methods and avoids the release of large quantities of polluting wastes or producing large quantities of dilute acid streams, by integrating a reduction oxidation process for the indirect oxidation and cross-linking of the polyolefin. We have surprisingly discovered using sulfur trioxide will produce an infusible fiber at a lower temperature than previously disclosed. Additionally, we have discovered a method to recycle the consumed reagent by oxidation (SO<sub>2</sub>+Â½O<sub>2</sub>âSO<sub>3</sub>) to provide an integrated reduction oxidation process. The sulfur trioxide may be gaseous or dissolved in liquid state that is dissolved in suitable carrier such as sulfuric acid as oleum, to react with the polyolefin to make it infusible.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">We have further discovered that unsaturated polyolefins will react faster still and require less sulfur trioxide than polyethylene, and can allow a smaller reagent recycle process and lower consumption of oxygen.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Referring to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a process for making an infusible polyolefin is shown. The process includes the steps of: (a) contacting a polyolefin <b>10</b> in a sulfonation reactor <b>20</b> with a sulfonation mixture <b>15</b> having sulfur trioxide to produce an infusible polyolefin <b>25</b>; (b) recovering from the sulfonation reactor <b>20</b> a recovery stream <b>30</b> having sulfur dioxide; (c) oxidizing at least a portion of the sulfur dioxide in the recovery stream <b>30</b> in an oxidizer <b>70</b> to produce a recycle stream <b>100</b> so that the recycle stream <b>100</b> has an increased concentration of sulfur trioxide, relative to the recovery stream <b>30</b>; and (d) combining at least a portion of the recycle <b>100</b> stream with the sulfonation mixture <b>15</b> of step (a).</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In the first step (a) the polyolefin <b>10</b> is contacted with a sulfonation mixture <b>15</b> that includes sulfur trioxide. The polyolefin <b>10</b> is introduced into the sulfonation reactor <b>20</b> and is contacted with a sulfonation mixture <b>15</b> to produce the infusible polyolefin <b>25</b>. As used herein the term âinfusibleâ generally means that the polymers obtained according to the invention may be carbonized without decomposing or melting. Accordingly, the amount of infusibility desired is a function of the ease with which the polymer may thereafter be carbonized without an undue loss of material infusible is thus a functional term that is not intended to be particularly limiting.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The polyolefin <b>10</b> can be any polyolefin. The polyolefin is typically thermoplastic and/or elastomeric, but may also be a thermoset if sufficiently cross-linked. As used herein, the term âpolyolefinâ refers to any polymer produced by addition polymerization and includes both saturated polyolefins and unsaturated polyolefins, and both aromatic and aliphatic polyolefins. The unsaturated hydrocarbon considered herein is generally composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. In some embodiments, one or more hydrogen atoms of the hydrocarbon may be replaced with a heteroatom-containing group, such as one or more halogen atoms, hydroxyl groups, amino groups, ether groups, thiol groups, thioether groups, or aldehyde groups. The heteroatom-containing group may also interrupt a carbon-carbon bond, as in the case of carbonyl (CO), oxygen (âOâ), sulfur (âSâ), or any of the above exemplary groups, where applicable (e.g., an amino group linking two or three carbon atoms).</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In some aspects, the polyolefin may comprise a saturated aliphatic polyolefin, or unsaturated aliphatic polyolefin, or alkyl polyolefin, or aromatic polyolefin, or mixed polyolefins made from mixtures of the foregoing or copolymers from their constituent monomers. Some examples of unsaturated hydrocarbons useful for producing respective addition polymers include ethylene, propylene, 2-butene, isoprene, butadiene, styrene, and copolymers thereof. In other embodiments the polyolefin is a copolymer of at least two monomers wherein one monomer is selected from ethylene or propylene, and a second monomer is selected from 2-butene, isoprene, butadiene, styrene, or combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In the case wherein the polyolefin includes at least one unsaturated carbon to carbon bond, desirably the unsaturation begins on a carbon atom that is positioned adjacent to a terminal carbon atom up to 50% away from a terminal carbon atom. In other embodiments, the polyolefin includes at least one unsaturated carbon to carbon bond at least 15% away from a terminal carbon atom and up to 50% away from a terminal carbon atom on the copolymer backbone, or at least 20% away from a terminal carbon atom and up to 50% away from a terminal carbon atom, or at least 25% away from a terminal carbon atom up to 50% away from a terminal carbon on the copolymer backbone.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In other embodiments, the degree of unsaturation in the polyolefin backbone can be from about 1% to about 50% prior to sulfonation, or from about 2% to about 45%, or from about 3% to about 40%, or from about 4% to about 35%, or from about 5% to about 30%, or from about 6% to about 25%, or from about 7% to about 20%, or from about 8% to about 15%, or from about 1% to about 10% prior to sulfonation of the polyolefin.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In some embodiments the polyolefin comprises from about 1 mole % to about 10 mole % butadiene and from about 99 mole % to about 90 mole % ethylene, from about 2 mole % to about 9 mole % butadiene and from about 98 mole % to about 91 mole % ethylene, from about 3 mole % to about 7 mole % butadiene and from about 97 mole % to about 93 mole % ethylene, from about 4 mole % to about 6 mole % butadiene and from about 96 mole % to about 94 mole % ethylene, from about 5 mole % to about 10 mole % butadiene and from about 95 mole % to about 90 mole % ethylene.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In one embodiment, the polyolefin can be any polyolefin having a unitary chain length of from about 2 to about 24 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 23 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 22 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 21 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 20 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 19 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 18 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 17 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 16 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 15 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 14 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 13 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 12 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 11 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 10 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 9 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 8 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 7 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 6 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 5 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 4 carbon atoms; in another embodiment from about 2 to about 3 carbon atoms and copolymers of any of the aforementioned polyolefins. In another embodiment, the polyolefin is selected from polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutylene and homogeneous or heterogeneous copolymers thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In the case of polyethylene, the polyethylene can be any of the types of polyethylene known in the art, such as for example, low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), very low density polyethylene (VLDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), high molecular weight polyethylene (HMWPE), and ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE).</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In the case of polypropylene, the polypropylene can also be any of the types of polypropylenes known in the art, such as, isotactic, atactic, and syndiotactic polypropylene. The polyolefin precursor may or may not also be derived from, or include segments or monomeric units of other addition monomers, such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, vinyl acetate (as well as partially or fully hydrolyzed derivatives of vinyl acetate, such as vinyl alcohol), and acrylonitrile, except that the polyolefin precursor preferably does not include these other addition monomers in more than an equal amount by monomer number or weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The polyolefin can be a fiber having any desired thickness (i.e., diameter). For example, in different embodiments, the fiber can have a thickness of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 microns, or a thickness within a range bounded by any two of these values. In some embodiments, the fiber is in the form of a tow, while in other embodiments the fiber is in the form of a single filament. Continuous filaments or tows from very low count (&lt;500) to very high counts (&gt;50,000) are considered herein. Such fibers may also be stapled or chopped (short-segment). The polyolefin fiber may also be in the form of a fiber, yarn, fabric, mesh, or felt.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The polyolefin fiber can be produced by any of the methods known in the art. In some embodiments, the polyolefin fiber is produced using a melt-spinning process. In other embodiments, the fiber is produced using a solution-spinning process (fiber is produced by coagulation of solid fiber from solution of the polymer in a solvent). The conditions and methodology employed in melt-spinning and solution-spinning processes are well known in the art. Moreover, the fiber precursor may be produced utilizing a single or bi-component extrusion process. The conditions and methodology employed in single or bi-component extrusion processes are also well known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In the sulfonation process, the polyolefin <b>10</b> is at least partially sulfonated by contacting the polyolefin <b>10</b> with a sulfonation mixture <b>15</b> using any of the methods and conditions known in the art for sulfonating a polyolefin. Generally, the sulfonation methods and conditions considered herein include where the polymer is exposed to a source of SO<sub>x </sub>species, such as for example SO<sub>3 </sub>in an inert environment for the purpose of sulfonating the polyolefin. The sulfonation methods and conditions considered herein can be, for example, any of the processes known in the art in which a polymer is sulfonated using either a liquid or gaseous phase, for example, using sulfuric acid, fuming sulfuric acid (oleum), or chlorosulfonic acid, or their mixtures, in order to sulfonate the polymer fiber. The polyolefin is contacted with the sulfonation mixture in a sulfonation reactor <b>20</b> under conditions suitable for producing an infusible fiber. The period of time (i.e., residence time) that the polyolefin fiber is exposed to the sulfonating species as well as the temperature during exposure to the sulfonating species (i.e., sulfonation temperature) can be suitably adjusted to ensure the predetermined level of sulfonation.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The sulfonation temperature is generally below a carbonization temperature. Typically, sulfonation temperature is from about 10Â° C., 20Â° C., 30Â° C., 40Â° C., 50Â° C., 60Â° C., 70Â° C., 80Â° C., 90Â° C., 100Â° C., 110Â° C., 120Â° C., 130Â° C., 140Â° C., 150Â° C., 160Â° C., 170Â° C., 180Â° C., 190Â° C., 200Â° C., 210Â° C., 220Â° C., 230Â° C., 240Â° C., 250Â° C., 260Â° C., 270Â° C., 280Â° C., 290Â° C., or 300Â° C., or a sulfonation temperature within a range bounded by any two of the foregoing values (for example, at least or above 10Â° C., 20Â° C., 40Â° C., 50Â° C., and up to or less than 120Â° C., 130Â° C., 140Â° C., 150Â° C., 160Â° C., 170Â° C., 180Â° C., 190Â° C., 200Â° C., 250Â° C., or 300Â° C., or at least or above 20Â° C., and up to or less than 120Â° C., 1440Â° C., 160Â° C., 170Â° C., 180Â° C., or 200Â° C., or at least or above 20Â° C., and up to or less than 80Â° C., 90Â° C., 100Â° C., 120Â° C., 140Â° C., 160Â° C., or 180Â° C.). In another embodiment, the temperature of the sulfonation mixture is from about 10Â° C. to about 120Â° C., from about 10Â° C. to about 95Â° C., from about 20Â° C. to about 80Â° C. or from about 40Â° C. to about 80Â° C., including all temperatures within a range bounded by any two of the foregoing values.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The residence time at sulfonation is very much dependent on several variables, including the sulfonation temperature used, concentration of sulfonating agent in the reaction medium, level of applied tension (if any), crystallinity of the polyolefin polymer, and the thickness of the polyolefin fiber. The residence time is also dependent on the sulfonation method used (i.e., liquid phase, gas phase or a combination utilizing both phase processes). As would be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the degree of sulfonation achieved at a particular sulfonating temperature and residence time can be replicated by use of a higher sulfonation temperature at a shorter residence time, or by use of a lower sulfonation temperature at a longer residence time. Similarly, the residence time required to achieve a degree of sulfonation in a polyolefin fiber of a certain thickness may result in a higher degree of sulfonation in a thinner fiber and a lower degree of sulfonation in a thicker fiber with all other conditions and variables normalized. However, generally, for polyolefin fibers having a thickness in the range of 0.5 to 50 microns, the residence time at sulfonation is typically no more than 90 minutes to ensure at least partial sulfonation (i.e., where sulfonation has not occurred through the entire diameter of the fiber through the core, thus producing a surface-sulfonated polyolefin fiber). In different embodiments, depending on such variables as the sulfonation temperature and fiber thickness, the residence time at sulfonation may be up to, or less than 90 minutes, 80 minutes, 70 minutes, 60 minutes (1 hour), 50 minutes, 40 minutes, 30 minutes, 20 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes, or 1 minute, or a residence time within a range bounded by any two of the foregoing values. In another embodiment residence time at sulfonation is of from about 0.5 seconds to about 2 hours, or from about 1 second to about 1 hour, or from about 5 seconds to about 30 minutes, or a residence time within a range bounded by any two of the foregoing values and under conditions of an inert atmosphere or an oxidizing environment.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In the case were the polyolefin is in the form of a fiber or continuous thread, in some embodiments the sulfonation process is practiced without applying a stress (tension) along the length of the fiber or thread. In other embodiments, the sulfonation process, is practiced by applying a stress along the fiber or thread length. For example, the stress can be applied to avoid fiber shrinkage. In particular embodiments, a high degree of axial stress (e.g., 10 MPa or higher) is applied when a small pore size and narrow pore size distribution is desired. In some embodiments, 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20 MPa of stress is applied in each step involving sulfonation and/or carbonization to obtain a desired morphology in the carbonized fiber.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In varying embodiments, the sulfonation mixture includes sulfur trioxide ranging from about 0.01 to about 100 mole percent, based on the total moles of sulfur containing compounds in the sulfonation mixture.

      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In one embodiment, the polyolefin is submerged into or passed through a liquid containing sulfur trioxide or a sulfur trioxide precursor such as chlorosulfonic acid, (HSO<sub>3</sub>Cl). In some embodiments, the polyolefin is passed through the liquid by pulling a fiber into the liquid from a reel or spool of fiber either unconstrained or held at a specified tension. Typically, the liquid containing sulfur trioxide is fuming sulfuric acid (i.e., oleum, which typically contains 15-30% free SO<sub>3</sub>) or chlorosulfonic acid, or a liquid solution thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In other embodiments, the polyolefin is contacted with a sulfonating gas in a gaseous atmosphere (i.e., not in a liquid). For example, a polyolefin fiber can be introduced into a chamber containing SO<sub>3 </sub>gas, or a gaseous reactive precursor thereof, or mixture of the SO<sub>3 </sub>gas with another gas as discussed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">With respect to the remaining constituents comprising the sulfonation mixture, it may include materials selected from carbon dioxide, nitrogen, argon, helium, sulfur dioxide and the like. Desirably, the remaining constituents comprising the sulfonation mixture include sulfur dioxide. As further described herein, the amount of gaseous SO<sub>3 </sub>in the sulfonation mixture may vary depending upon the amount of oxygen introduced in the oxidation step, described herein, to react with SO<sub>2</sub>, the amount of SO<sub>3 </sub>reacted with the polymer, which in turn may be a function of the amount of SO<sub>3 </sub>forming sulfuric acid in the process. As noted above, the SO<sub>3 </sub>concentration can be from 0.1 mole % to 100 mole % based on the total moles of the sulfonation mixture, including all ranges there between, and desirably can be from about 0.5 mole % to less than about 10 mole %, or from about 1 mole % to about 5%, based on the total moles of the sulfonation mixture. The amount of SO<sub>3 </sub>in the sulfonation mixture may also be varied by modifying, for example, the amount of CO<sub>2 </sub>from the sulfonation step that is subsequently removed or left in the process gases, as well as by the amount of SO<sub>2 </sub>left unreacted during the oxidation step, as just mentioned.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">As used herein, the terms âpartially sulfonated,â âpartial sulfonation,â âincompletely sulfonated,â or âincomplete sulfonationâ are used interchangeably and are defined as an amount of sulfonation below a saturated (or âcompleteâ) level of saturation. The degree of sulfonation can be determined by, for example, measuring the thermal characteristics (e.g., softening or charring point, or decomposition temperature associated with pyrolysis of incompletely sulfonated polyolefin) or physical characteristics (e.g., density, rigidity, or weight fraction of decomposable unsulfonated-polymer segment) of the partially sulfonated polyolefin. Since rigidity, as well as the softening and charring point (and thermal infusibility, in general) all increase with an increase in sulfonation, monitoring of any one or combination of these characteristics can be correlated with a level of sulfonation relative to a saturated level of sulfonation. In particular, the polyolefin, such as a fiber, can be considered to possess a saturated level of sulfonation by exhibiting a constant thermal or physical characteristic with increasing sulfonation treatment time. In contrast, a fiber that has not reached a saturated level of sulfonation will exhibit a change in a thermal or physical characteristic with increasing sulfonation treatment time. Moreover, if the polyolefin with a saturated degree of sulfonation is taken as 100% sulfonated, fibers with a lesser degree of sulfonation can be ascribed a numerical level of sulfonation below 100%, which is commensurate or proportionate with the difference in thermal or physical characteristic between the partially sulfonated fiber and completely sulfonated fiber. In different embodiments, the polyolefin is sulfonated up to or less than a sulfonation degree of 100%, 95%, 90%, 85%, 80%, 75%, 70%, 65%, 60%, 55%, 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, or 5% relative to a saturated level of sulfonation taken as 100%. The level of sulfonation can be further verified or made more accurate by an elemental analysis. The degree of sulfonation (DS) can be determined or monitored at points during the process by use of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), or other suitable analytical technique.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Accordingly, one skilled in the art would understand that the degree sulfonation of the polyolefin <b>10</b> is dependent upon a variety of factors, such as, the amount of time the polyolefin <b>10</b> is in contact with the sulfonation mixture <b>15</b>, the concentration of the sulfur trioxide in the sulfonation mixture <b>15</b> and the temperature of the sulfur trioxide in contact with the polyolefin <b>10</b>. It is understood that sulfur trioxide would be present in a sulfonation mixture of either sulfuric acid, oleum, or a gaseous SO<sub>3 </sub>mixture. Although not to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the sulfonation reaction with the polyolefin is as follows:</p>

      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0045">The net reaction of SO<sub>3 </sub>with a polyolefin in accordance with the present process produces one mole of SO<sub>2 </sub>and one mole of sulfuric acid per double bond generated in the polyolefin. Not wishing to be bound by theory, the individual reactions believed to occur include, in the polymer oxidation (dehydrogenation) step, SO<sub>3 </sub>initially reacting with the polymer to form a sulfonated polyolefin. A portion of the sulfonated polyolefin will eliminate SO<sub>2 </sub>and water to form a double bond on the polymer. Water subsequently reacts with SO<sub>3 </sub>to form H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, or sulfuric acid. The net effect is partial sulfonation and partial oxidation of the polyolefin to produce an infusible polymer and reduction of SO<sub>3</sub>. The degree of reaction can be manipulated to change the yield and properties of the infusible polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0046">Another advantage of the process of making carbon fibers in accordance with the invention is that the process is energy efficient. The process of the invention does not generate cyanide. Accordingly, there is also provided a process that does not contain an energy source for the destruction of cyanide.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0047">Another advantage of the process of the invention is that coupling sulfur oxidation and reduction a reduced amount of sulfur is consumed compared to the prior art processes that do not integrate sulfur oxidation and reduction. Thus, there is now also provided an integrated sulfur oxidation zone and a sulfur reduction zone. Advantageously, the process of the present invention provides a sulfur efficiency based on the molar ratio of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>produced to sulfur consumed of from about 0.75 to about 1.5, or about 0.75 to 1.25, or about 0.75 to 1.0. As used herein, the term âsulfur consumedâ means the amount of sulfur, on an elemental basis, that is converted to a specie or compound that is not readily oxidizable to SO<sub>3</sub>. One skilled in the art will understand an immediate advantage of the present invention is that the amount of sulfur utilized in preparing the sulfonation mixture and sulfonating the polyolefin is from about 25% to about 50% less than prior processes utilizing sulfur for making an infusible polyolefin. This efficiency is substantially better than previous methods wherein the SO<sub>2 </sub>generated was absorbed, scrubbed or otherwise removed from the process. This further results in economic and energy savings substantially greater than previously realized.</p>

The onset of the melting temperature of the polyolefin is easily determined by one skilled in the art using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), on a first scan at a rate of 10Â° C./min. The onset of melting can be determined by those of skill in analytics and is distinguished from the start of melting.

For example, Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 5<sup>th </sup>ed., vol. 23 provides a detailed description of single-pass SO<sub>3 </sub>absorption and multiple-pass SO<sub>3 </sub>absorption processes, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>

      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0059">There are three important characteristics in oxidizing sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide; it is exothermic, reversible, and shows a decrease in molar volume for the desired product, SO<sub>3</sub>. To improve equilibrium for the reaction, past practices have used different methodologies, such as increasing the concentration of SO<sub>2</sub>, increasing the concentration of O<sub>2</sub>, and removing the SO<sub>3 </sub>by interpass absorption to name a few. In a single pass absorption process the SO<sub>2 </sub>is oxidized to SO<sub>3 </sub>in a multipass converter. Gas leaving the converter passes through a single SO<sub>3 </sub>absorption tower. In a multiple pass process intermediate SO<sub>3 </sub>absorption takes place after the second or third converter pass.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0060">Advantageously, the process of the present invention does not require complete oxidation of the sulfur dioxide to produce sulfur trioxide. Partial oxidation allows for economy of scale and allows for the sulfur dioxide to act a diluent. Thus, a single pass oxidation is now achievable rather than utilizing a multi-pass converter.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0061">Sulfur dioxide gas is catalytically oxidized to sulfur trioxide in a fixed-bed reactor that typically operates adiabatically in each catalyst pass. To obtain optimum conversion, the heat of reaction from succeeding converter passes is removed by superheaters or gas heat exchangers. The gas temperature rise is almost directly proportional to the sulfur dioxide converted in each pass even though SO<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations can vary widely.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0062">In oleum manufacture, SO<sub>3 </sub>is absorbed into sulfuric acid using one or more special absorption towers irrigated by recirculated oleum. Generally, the amount of SO<sub>3 </sub>that can be absorbed from the process gas is up to about 70% due to the vapor pressure of the sulfur trioxide.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0063">Thus, in accordance with the present invention, by utilizing a SO<sub>2 </sub>oxidation step, a portion of the SO<sub>2 </sub>produced in the polymer sulfonation step is oxidized with O<sub>2 </sub>to form SO<sub>3</sub>, which in turn is used as a reactant to produce the infusible polyolefin. The SO<sub>3 </sub>utilized is returned to the reactor in mixture with additional circulating SO<sub>2</sub>, and optionally CO<sub>2</sub>, as a diluent. This novel additional recirculating SO<sub>2 </sub>allows complete conversion of the differential SO<sub>2 </sub>generated by the last pass of the gas through the sulfonation reactor <b>20</b>, and complete consumption of the oxygen because there is a stochiometric excess of SO<sub>2 </sub>in the oxidizer to drive the reversible reaction forward.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0064">The present process is advantageous over prior art processes which require combining the SO<sub>3 </sub>with water (usually in the form of 93-98% sulfuric acid) to form additional sulfuric acid in order to consume substantially all of the SO<sub>2 </sub>generated in the sulfonation reactor <b>20</b>. In the prior art processes, the net reaction of SO<sub>3 </sub>with polyolefin without SO<sub>2 </sub>recycle would produce substantially more and at least about twice as much sulfuric acid. That is, only partial conversion of the SO<sub>2 </sub>would occur because of the reaction equilibrium. To drive the reaction to completion as required to reduce the SO<sub>2 </sub>level to a permissible vent discharge concentration, the SO<sub>3</sub>-containing gas stream would have to be scrubbed with water which creates additional sulfuric acid as a consequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0065">Referring to <figref>FIG. 2</figref> another aspect of the present invention is illustrated, a process for making a carbon fiber from the infusible fiber described above. The process includes the steps of (a) contacting a polyolefin <b>10</b> in a sulfonation reactor <b>20</b> with a sulfonation mixture <b>15</b> having sulfur trioxide to produce an infusible polyolefin <b>25</b>; (b) recovering from the sulfonation reactor <b>20</b> a first recovery stream <b>30</b> having sulfur dioxide; (c) oxidizing at least a portion of the sulfur dioxide in the recovery stream <b>30</b> in an oxidizer <b>70</b> to produce an enriched recycle stream <b>100</b> so that the enriched recycle stream <b>100</b> has an increased concentration of sulfur trioxide, relative to the recovery stream <b>30</b>; (d) combining at least a portion of the enriched recycle <b>100</b> stream with the sulfonation mixture <b>15</b> of step (a) and (e) carbonizing the infusible polyolefin to produce a carbon fiber 165.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0066">It is to be understood that the process steps (a)-(d), inclusive are the same as previously described with reference to <figref>FIG. 1</figref> above, the description of which is incorporated herein with respect to <figref>FIG. 2</figref> such that in the drawings of Figures, like parts and objects in the several views have similar reference numerals. The infusible polyolefin <b>25</b> is heated to produce a carbon fiber. Carbonizing the infusible polyolefin may be performed in a single heating step or may be carried out in a plurality of heating steps, where each successive heating step involves subjecting the infusible polyolefin to a greater temperature than the preceding heating step. In accordance with the present invention, the carbonizing step includes introducing the infusible polyolefin to a low temperature desulfonation oven 150. The temperature in the desulfonation oven 150 can independently be selected from any of the sulfonation temperatures and residence times provided above (e.g., from about 30Â° C., 40Â° C., 50Â° C., 60Â° C., 70Â° C., 80Â° C., 90Â° C., 100Â° C., 110Â° C., 120Â° C., 130Â° C., 140Â° C., 150Â° C., 160Â° C., 170Â° C., 180Â° C., 190Â° C., 200Â° C., 210Â° C., 220Â° C., 230Â° C., 240Â° C., 250Â° C., 260Â° C., 270Â° C., 280Â° C., 290Â° C., or 300Â° C.,). Moreover, a desulfonation process is generally practiced herein in the absence of an external sulfonating source, thereby not further adding sulfonating species to the infusible polyolefin, but limiting the amount of sulfonating species to the amount present in the sulfonated surface or the amount incorporated into polymer fiber for a melt-mixed fiber. The desulfonation process may include introducing an oxygen-containing compound, such as air, or may be practiced in an artificial oxygen-inert gas atmosphere, which may be conducted at either standard pressure (e.g., 0.9-1.2 bar), elevated pressure (e.g., 2-10 bar), or reduced pressure (e.g., 0.1-0.5 bar). In other embodiments, a pressure of precisely, about, or at least 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 bar, or a pressure within a range therein, is employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0067">In some embodiments, the desulfonation process includes exposing the infusible polyolefin (before, during, and/or after the sulfonation or desulfonation process) to radiative energy. The radiative energy can be, for example, electromagnetic radiation (e.g., ultraviolet, X-ray, infrared, or microwave radiation) or energetic particles (e.g., electron or neutron beam). In the case of electromagnetic radiation, the radiation may be dispersed or collimated, as in a laser. In some embodiments, the radiative energy is ionizing, while in other embodiments it is not ionizing. The fiber may alternatively or additionally be exposed to radiative energy before, during, or after sulfonation and/or carbonization. In some embodiments, electromagnetic or energetic particle radiation is not employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0068">The infusible polyolefin is then carbonized by subjecting it to carbonizing conditions in a carbonization step. The carbonization step includes any of the conditions, as known in the art, that cause carbonization of the sulfonated polymer. Generally, in different embodiments, the carbonization temperature can be about, or at least 300Â° C., 350Â° C., 400Â° C., 450Â° C., 500Â° C., 550Â° C., 600Â° C., 650Â° C., 700Â° C., 750Â° C., 800Â° C., 850Â° C., 900Â° C., 950Â° C., 1000Â° C., 1050Â° C., 1100Â° C., 1150Â° C., 1200Â° C., 1250Â° C., 1300Â° C., 1350Â° C., 1400Â° C., 1450Â° C., 1500Â° C., 1600Â° C., 1700Â° C., or 1800Â° C., or a temperature within a range bounded by any two of the foregoing temperatures. The amount of time that the sulfonated polyolefin is subjected to the carbonization temperature (i.e., carbonization time) is highly dependent on the carbonization temperature employed. Generally, the higher the carbonization temperature employed, the shorter the amount of time required. In different embodiments, depending on the carbonization temperature and other factors (e.g., pressure), the carbonization time can be, for example, about, at least, or no more than 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 hours, or within a range therein. In particular embodiments, it may be desired to gradually raise the temperature at a set or varied temperature ramp rate (e.g., 5Â° C./min, 10Â° C./min, or 20Â° C./min). In other embodiments, it may be desired to pass the sulfonated polymer through a furnace with a gradient of temperature at the entrance and exit of the furnace and at a set temperature inside the furnace in order to achieve the desired residence time. In other embodiments, it may be desired to subject the sulfonated polymer to a sudden (i.e., non-gradual) carbonization temperature. In some embodiments, after the sulfonated polyolefin is subjected to a desired carbonization temperature for a particular amount of time, the temperature is reduced either gradually or suddenly.</p>

Typically, the temperature capable of causing graphitization is greater than about 2000Â° C., 2100Â° C., 2200Â° C., 2300Â° C., 2400Â° C., 2500Â° C., 2600Â° C., 2700Â° C., 2800Â° C., 2900Â° C., 3000Â° C., 3100Â° C., or 3200Â° C., or a range between any two of these temperatures.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0071">The carbonization or graphitization step may be conducted in an atmosphere substantially devoid of a reactive gas (e.g., oxygen or hydrogen), and typically under an inert atmosphere. Some examples of inert atmospheres include nitrogen and the noble gases (e.g., helium or argon). The inert gas is generally made to flow at a specified flow rate, such as 0.1, 0.25, 0.50, 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 Liters/min. However, one or more reactive functionalizing species may be included in the carbonization step or in a post-treatment step (e.g., at the exit of the furnace as a post-carbonization step) to suitably functionalize the carbon fiber, e.g., by inclusion of a fluorocarbon compound to induce fluorination, or inclusion of an oxygen-containing species to induce oxygenation (to include, e.g., hydroxy or ether groups), or inclusion of amino-, thio-, or phosphino-species to aminate, thiolate, or phosphinate the carbon fiber. Thus, in some embodiments, it may be preferred to include at least one reactive gas, such as oxygen, hydrogen, ammonia, an organoamine, carbon dioxide, methane, a fluoroalkane, a phosphine, or a mercaptan. The one or more reactive gases may, for example, desirably change or adjust the compositional, structural, or physical characteristics of the carbon fiber. The functionalized groups on the carbon fiber can have a variety of functions, e.g., to bind to metal species that are catalytically active, or to modify or adjust the surface miscibility, absorptive, or wetability characteristics, particularly for gas absorption and filtration applications.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0072">The pressure employed in the carbonization (or graphitization) step is typically ambient (e.g., around 1 atm). However, in some embodiments it may desirable to use a higher pressure (e.g., above 1 atm, such as 1.5, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100 atm, or any pressure within a range between any two specified pressures) to, for example, maintain a positive pressure inside the furnace and keep the sample free of oxygen at high temperature to avoid combustion or partial combustion. In other embodiments, it may be desired to use a lower pressure (e.g., below 1 atmosphere, such as 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, or 0.01 atmosphere, or any pressure within a range between any two specified pressures).</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0073">On skilled in the art will understand that the polyolefin to be sulfonated and/or carbonized may be in the form of a fiber, tow, mesh, or in another form (e.g., film, block, ring, tube, or woven or non-woven mat) depending on the predetermined application of the polyolefin composition.</p>

      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0085">Reaction of polyethylene, polyisoprene, trans, and poly(vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) with vapor phase SO<sub>3 </sub>diluted with inert gas and contact times of up to 60 seconds.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0086">A fully jacketed 2 liter glass reactor fitted with a silicone oil circulation bath was used to run both vapor phase and liquid phase sulfonation/dehydrogenation reactions. The apparatus is fitted with thermocouples for measuring both liquid and gas phase temperature, along with a nitrogen purge line, vapor trap to scrub SO<sub>3 </sub>vapor, and bottom drain to facilitate quenching of oleum into a wet ice bath at in completion of the reaction. The reactor has three 24/40 ground glass fittings (ports) to permit placing samples into the gas or liquid phase. The ports are closed with glass stopper when not in use for sample exposure. The sample hangers are 24/40 glass stoppers fitted with a glass rod. Each rod has two hooks to allow placement of 2 test samples on each sample hanger. Two small gauge wire holders were fitted to each hanger to hold the samples onto the hanger while exposure of the sample to the SO<sub>3 </sub>vapor space.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0087">Polymer test strips were prepared by pressing a small sample of the desired polymer between polished stainless steel plates treated with a silicone release agent. A hydrolytic press with heated platens was used to press the samples. A 6 milÃ2.5â³Ã2.5â³ spacer was used to control sample thickness size. After pressing, the samples were quenched in an ice bath and cut into approximately 1 cmÃ4 cm strips. See Table 1 for polymer description and source of polymers.</p>

      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">A sample of the unreacted polyethylene, and reacted samples 3-5 were analyzed by IR to determine extent of sulfonation and dehydrogenation. IR spectra were acquired with a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR with an ATR accessory using a Si crystal (128 scans, 4 cm-1 resolution). This technique is a surface technique that penetrates typically less than one micron into the sample.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">The change in appearance of the samples, color turning from clear to black, indicates that sulfonation and elimination of SO<sub>2 </sub>and water to from conjugated double bonds is very fast in the gas phase at 80Â° C. This observation is supported by the IR data. As can be seen from Sample 3, after 15 seconds of exposure almost complete reaction of CH<sub>2 </sub>groups on the surface of the polyethylene occurred as observed by the sample turning black.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">Advantageously, the present invention demonstrates a dramatic improvement results previously reported by D. Zhang, et al. Journal Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 62, 367-373 (1996). They found that partially oriented PE required 15 minutes to turn dark grey, and 30 min to turn black when exposed to concentrated (95%) sulfuric acid at 130Â° C. The present invention advantageously provides a greater than an order of magnitude increase in rate of color change (15 seconds vs. 900 seconds for Zhang et. al.) while running at a significantly lower temperature (80Â° C. vs. 130Â° C.).</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">Additionally, it was unexpected discovered that starting with a polyolefin with unsaturation such as polyisoprene, trans, results in an even faster rate of reaction, as indicated by color change. Polyisoprene, trans turned black in 5 seconds vs. 15 seconds for polyethylene, with reaction at the same conditions of 4.8-5.3% SO<sub>3 </sub>in the gas phase, and 80Â° C.</p>

      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">The reactor as used in Example 1 above was setup under a hood having a minimum air face velocity of 110 feet per minute. The reactor was purged with nitrogen for 45 minutes with 1 SCFH (&gt;10 volume turnover). The wet trap was charged with 50% caustic and wet ice. The reactor was then charged with 349 grams of 20% oleum. The nitrogen gas flow rate was set at 0.05 SCFH and the reactor is heated to 80Â° C. with silicone oil in circulating jacket. This will give a sulfur trioxide concentration in the gas phase of approximately 5%.</p>

      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0117">Samples were analyzed in a combined DSC-TGA instrument (model TA SDT Q600) to look at both weight loss and exotherm/endotherm on heating to 600Â° C. under an inert atmosphere. Samples were heated at 10Â° C./minute under nitrogen starting at room temperature to a final temperature of 600Â° C. The first heating cycle was recorded. Weight loss at &lt;300Â° C. and percent carbonized product obtained at 600Â° C. are shown in Table 3. It is believed that the weight loss in sample below 300Â° C. was due to loss of SO<sub>2 </sub>and water from the samples. As shown in Table 3 the control polyethylene and polyisobutylene samples show essentially no weight loss (1.4 and 1.5%) respectively below 300Â° C. Samples exposed to SO<sub>3 </sub>in the gas phase show progressively increasing weight loss below 300Â° C. with increasing exposure time to SO<sub>3</sub>. These results are consistent with the increasing weight gain with increasing exposure to SO<sub>3 </sub>as shown in Table 3.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0118">Surprisingly, the present invention demonstrates a significant increased rate of reaction for polyolefins over what has been previously reported. D. Zhang, et al. Journal Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 62, 367-373 (1996) found that a polyethylene fiber treated with concentrated sulfuric acid at 150Â° C. for 30 minutes showed a 7% weight loss when heated to 300Â° C. in a TGA device. We have shown a similar extent of reaction, 6% weight loss, with a film sample after 1 minute of exposure to SO<sub>3 </sub>vs. 30 minutes of exposure to concentrated sulfuric acid. Additionally, the reaction proceeded at a significantly and unexpectedly lower temperature, 80Â° C. vs. 150Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0119">Example 2 further illustrates that the film samples produce a carbonized product as determined by TGA analysis when heated to 600Â° C.</p>

      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0121">The reactor as used in Examples 1 and 2 above was setup under a hood having a minimum air face velocity of 110 feet per minute. The reactor was purged with nitrogen for 45 minutes with 1 SCFH (&gt;10 volume turnover). The wet trap was charged with 50% caustic and wet ice. The reactor was then charged with 349 grams of 20% oleum. The nitrogen gas flow rate was set at 0.05 SCFH and the reactor is heated to 80Â° C. with silicone oil in circulating jacket. This will give a sulfur trioxide concentration in the gas phase of approximately 5%.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0122">Samples of linear low density polyethylene test strips were prepared as described above. The samples were placed onto sample hangers with inconel wire so that when placed in the reaction apparatus the samples were submerged in the 20% oleum liquid for 5 and 10 minute time intervals. Changes in weight and appearance are recorded in Table 4 below.</p>

      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0126">The results show that liquid 20% oleum at 80Â° C. is much more reactive with polyolefins than concentrated sulfuric acid as was earlier reported by D. Zhang, et al. Journal Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 62, 367-373 (1996). D. Zhang required 30 minutes at 150Â° C. to turn a polyethylene sample black vs. 22 seconds when subjected to a liquid containing SO<sub>3 </sub>as we observed using 20% oleum.</p>
