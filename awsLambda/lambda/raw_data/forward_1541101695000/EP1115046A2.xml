  <description id="descr_eng" lang="eng" format="original" date-changed="20070505">
    <p id="p-00001-en">This invention relates to a configurable electronic controller for appliances designed to control the function of appliances such as Refrigerators, Washing Machines, Dryers, Dish-Washers, Air-Conditioners, and the like. The controller is configurable in a variety of ways to provide flexibility and optimization of control in the intended application, at low cost.</p>
    <heading>
      <b>Background Art</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en">Electrical controls used in appliances are required to be low-cost as appliances are largely targeted at the cost-sensitive, high-volume consumer market. As a result of this requirement, the controls used in many appliances are still of the non-electronic, electro-mechanical variety. Examples of such controls are Bimetallic or liquid capillary thermostats, clockwork timers, and mechanical switches and relays. These controls are inherently limited in reliability because they involve moving mechanical parts that are prone to wear and tear. In addition, repeated thermal expansion and contraction causes thermal stress wearout. However, their low-cost has retained their use for the past several years inspite of advances in electronics technology.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en">Solid-state controls including electronic controls have made in-roads in some applications - such as in controls for washing machines. These controls are typically designed around a microcontroller, which is programmed to perform the desired control actions. As the real-world environment of the application typically involves the processing of a significant number of signals and devices (e.g. sensors, switches, motors, etc.) some of which are analog in nature, a significant amount of circuitry is required in addition to the microcontroller -- such as latches, decoders, drivers, multiplexers, analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters, etc. Alternatively, a more expensive microcontroller that incorporates the necessary capability, may be used. In either case, it results in increased cost. Consequently, inspite of improved reliability and reduced service support costs, there is no significant benefit in the direct cost of the bill of material. As a result, the application does not realize the full benefits of an electronic solution. US Patents 4158759, 4367387, 4399352, 4406945, 4431893, 4481393, 4504716, 4533810, 4367387, and 4504716 are examples of such electronic controls for various appliances.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en">Some reconfigurable electronic controllers are also known. US Patents 5306995, 5412291, 5619614, and 5647231 describe some reconfigurable electronic controllers. However, the inventions covered by these patents are limited to only washing machines and dryers, and are at the same time relatively expensive to implement as they make use of fairly computation-intensive algorithms utilizing fuzzy-logic implementations on microprocessor-based hardware. The limitations cited above in the case of microprocessor-based implementations are also applicable to these inventions.</p>
    <heading>
      <b>The object and summary of the invention</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00005-en">The object of this invention is to provide a single, compact configurable electronic control unit using a universal ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) control device, that overcomes all the above-mentioned drawbacks, providing the advantages of electronic control, at low cost by providing a solution that is effective both in terms of improving reliability to the desired level as well in providing significant benefits in the direct cost of material and manufacture.

    <p id="p-00031-en">Signals (15a â 15f), as shown in Fig.-6, are received by the Load Interface Unit (12) from the Central Control Unit (6) and latched using Latches (52a-52f). These latched signals are then applied to the input of Switch Control circuits (53a-53f) which drive Switches (54a-54f) to control the external load devices which are actuators (such as motors, blowers, solenoid valves, etc.) in the appliance for controlling its operation. The Switch Control circuits (53a-53f) together with the Current Shunts (55a-55f), continuously monitor the electrical conditions of the Switches (54a-54f) and the Loads (56a-56f) in order to protect them against over-current and over-heat conditions as well as to provide the special feature of "Soft-Start" of the load so as to minimize the electrical stresses imposed at the time of turning it on. The signals (57a-57f) from the Current Shunts (55a-55f) are also received at the inputs of Analog Multiplexer (58) which feeds them one-at-a-time, under control of signal (15o) from the Central Control Unit (6), to a Load Current Sense Circuit (59) which also incorporates special circuitry for correcting for the sensitivity and offset of the sensed signal using data (M) supplied by Non-Volatile Memory (19). The corrected signal from the output of the Load Current Sense Circuit (59) is received by Comparator (60) which receives a reference value (15p) from the Central Control Unit (6) and provides a comparison result (14) to the Central Control Unit (6).</p>
    <p id="p-00032-en">The Supply Interface Unit (16), as shown in Fig.-7, receives the supply voltage (65) at the input of Voltage Sense Circuit (61) which converts it to a digital value (17b) and applies the result to the input of Digital Comparator (62) which receives a reference value (M) corresponding to the low-voltage limit from the Non-Volatile Memory (19) at its other input, and Digital Comparator (63) which receives a reference value (M) corresponding to the high-voltage limit from the Non-Volatile Memory (19) at its other input, the result of the comparisons are fed to the input of Latch (64) to furnish a combined result (17a) to the Central Control Unit (6).</p>
    <p id="p-00033-en">As shown in Fig.-3, the signals (4a-4b) sent by the Input Interface Unit (3), signals (8a-8f) emitted by the User Interface Unit (7), signal (14) presented by the Load Interface Unit (12), and the signal (17) outputted by the Supply Interface Unit are processed by the Configurable Logic Circuit (25), with the help of the Counters and Timers (26) circuit, Memory (28) circuit, and Real-Time-Clock (33) circuit under the control of the Sequence Control circuit (31).</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en">The functions performed by the Configurable Logic Circuit (25) as well as the sequence operated by the Sequence Control circuit (31) are configured by the configuration data (M) supplied by the Non-Volatile Memory (19).</p>
    <p id="p-00035-en">In the application of the Configurable Electronic Controller for Appliances in a Washing machine (67) as shown in Fig.-8, Water Temperature Sensor (70) and the Water Level Sensor (68) are driven by Sensor Drive circuits (36a) and (36b) in the Input Interface Unit (3) and provide analog signals (1a) and (1b) at the inputs of Analog Multiplexer (37). These signals are selectively connected to the input of Analog-to-Digital Converter (38), as shown in Fig.-4, under the control of selection signal (5a) from the Central Control Unit (6). Analog-to-Digital Converter (38) also receives sensitivity and offset correction data (5b) from the Central Control Unit and uses the data for correcting for the sensitivity and offset of the received signal. The digital output from the Analog-to-Digital Converter (38) is compared with a reference value (4a) from the Central Control Unit (6) by the Digital Comparator (39). The result of the comparison is received at one of the inputs of Digital Multiplexer (40) which also receives the digital signal from Cover-Open Sensor (60) at another input. The signals at the inputs of the Digital Multiplexer (40) are selectively brought to its output under control of selection signal (5c) from the Central Control Unit (6) and are filtered by Noise Filter (41) the output (4b) of which is connected to the Configurable Logic Circuit (25). Simultaneously, user input data supplied through a potentiometer knob and keyboard in the Control Panel (71) of the Washing Machine is received as signals (10a) and (10i-10n) at the inputs of the Configurable Electronic Controller for Appliances. The analog signal (10a) from the potentiometer is selectively connected to the input of Analog-to-Digital Converter (44) under the control of selection signal (8a) from the Configurable Logic Circuit (25). Analog-to-Digital Converter (45) also receives sensitivity and offset correction data (8b) from the Configurable Logic Circuit (25) and uses the data for correcting for the sensitivity and offset of the received signal. The digital output from the Analog-to-Digital Converter (45) is compared with a reference value (8d) from the Configurable Logic Circuit (25) by the Digital Comparator (46). The result of the comparison is received at one of the inputs of Digital Multiplexer (47) which also receives the digital signals from the keyboard (10i-10n) at other inputs. The signals at the inputs of the Digital Multiplexer (47) are selectively brought to its output under control of selection signal (8c) from the Configurable Logic Circuit (25) and are filtered by Noise Filter (48) the output (7b) of which is connected to the Configurable Logic Circuit (25). Signals (7c) and (8f) from the Configurable Logic Circuit (25) control Digital Demultiplexer (49) to generate signals (11a-11h) for scanning the keyboard in the Control Panel (71). At the same time, signals (7d-7k) from the Configurable Logic Circuit (25) after latching in Latches (51a-51f) drive the input of Display and Audio Driver circuit (50) which also receives display and audio mode control data from Non-Volatile Memory (M), and drives the external display and audio devices using signals (11a-11n) to provide feedback information such as annunciation of selected 'Wash Mode', to the user. The signals received by the Configurable Logic Circuit (25) are processed , using configuration data (M) from the Non-Volatile Memory (19), under the control of timing sequence control signal (32) received from the Sequence Control circuit (31), and parametric data (30) received from Memory (28) with the help of Counters and Timers (26) and Real Time Clock (33). The result of the processing generates control signal (15a-15f) which control the operation of the Load Control Unit (12). The signals (15a-15f) are latched in Latches (52a-52e) and drive switches (53a-53e) which operate the Detergent Dispense Valve (75), Heater (73), Water Fill Valve (74), Wash Motor (72), and Water Drain Valve (76), in the desired manner.</p>
