      <b>Background Art</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Potato chips produced by frying thin potato slices in high-temperature oil have a unique light crispy texture and a savory flavor. However, fried potato chips have a high oil content that reaches about 40% of the product weight, and therefore have a very high calorie content. Therefore, some methods have been developed to produce non-fried potato chips having a low oil content. However, non-fried potato chips can hardly have a crispy texture like conventional potato chips, but have a crunchy texture or a texture like thin paper.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Hereinbelow, conventional techniques relating to snack foods including non-fried potato chips and fabricated potato chips will be described with reference to prior patent literatures.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Patent Literatures 1, 2, and 3 disclose techniques in which potato is heated with microwaves and then further dried by another drying method, and all these techniques focus on dehydration and puffing caused by microwaves. Patent Literatures 4 and 5 disclose techniques in which potato is dried using superheated steam, and both the techniques are intended to puff dough by a large amount of heat of superheated steam. Further, Patent Literatures 6 and 7 disclose heat-drying techniques in which puffing is caused by blowing high-temperature and high-velocity air stream.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Some of these prior patent literatures describe also a drying method in which microwaves and superheated steam are used in combination and a drying method in which microwaves and high-temperature and high-velocity air stream are used in combination. When dough prepared by mashing potatoes to a paste is used as a raw material as in the case of fabricated potato chips, the methods described in the prior patent literatures can produce potato chips having a crispy texture like fried potato chips. However, when raw potato slices are directly used, none of the methods described in the prior patent literatures can produce potato chips having a crispy texture like fried potato chips.</p>

      <b>Summary of Invention</b>

    <heading id="h-00006-en">
      <b>Technical Problem</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide a production method in which potato chips are produced not by frying in oil but by drying so that their oil content is reduced but their flavor and texture are comparable to those of potato chips produced by frying in oil, which are difficult to produce by conventional techniques.</p>
    <heading id="h-00007-en">
      <b>Solution to Problem</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In order to achieve the above object, the present inventors have focused attention on heat treatment of potato at high temperature, and therefore have tested various heating methods. However, desired flavor and texture could hardly be achieved by a single drying method. Then, the present inventors have studied various combinations of drying methods, and as a result have succeeded in producing potato chips comparable in texture to potato chips produced by frying in oil even when potato slices are used as a raw material. This has led to the completion of the present invention.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">More specifically, the present invention is directed to a method for producing potato chips, comprising the step of subjecting potato slices to heat treatment with superheated steam and then subjecting the potato slices to heat treatment with high-temperature and high-velocity air stream.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Here, the superheated steam refers to saturated steam heated to 100°C or higher at ordinary pressure. Therefore, the potato slices can be heated with water vapor at 100°C or higher having a very large amount of heat. Further, the heat treatment with high-temperature and high-velocity air stream refers to a method in which high-temperature and high-velocity air stream at 100°C or higher is blown onto the potato slices to heat the potato slices at once. The heat treatment is performed by, for example, blowing high-temperature air stream onto food through slit- or tube-shaped nozzles placed in a heating chamber at a high air velocity, specifically an air velocity exceeding 40 m/s to heat the food. Such a technique is used also for producing puffed confectionery or for baking cookies.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In this way, potato slices are treated with high-temperature superheated steam at 100°C or higher, and are then puffed by blowing high-temperature and high-velocity air stream thereonto. As a result, the inside of the potato slices is sufficiently and uniformly puffed, and therefore non-fried potato chips having a light texture can be obtained which cannot be obtained by any conventional method.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Further, in the present invention, oil is preferably applied to the potato slices before the heat treatment with high-temperature and high-velocity air stream. This allows the non-fried potato chips to have a more crispy texture like fried potato chips. Here, the amount of the oil applied to the potato slices may be very small. Therefore, the oil content of the product according to the present invention can be reduced to one-half or less, optimally about 1/3 to 1/20 of that of a fried product while the product according to the present invention is comparable in crispy texture to the fried product. This is effective also in reducing the amount of production of acrylamide suspected of being a carcinogen as compared to the fried product.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Further, in the present invention, the potato slices are preferably further subjected to final drying by hot-air drying after the heat treatment with superheated steam and the heat treatment with high-temperature and high-velocity air stream. The potato slices may be dried by continuously performing the heat treatment with high-temperature and high-velocity air stream. In this case, however, the potato slices are likely to burn due to high temperature. Therefore, after being puffed with high-temperature and high-velocity hot air, the potato slices are preferably dried in a conventional hot-air drier at a lower temperature of, for example, 100°C or less.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Further, in the present invention, the potato slices are preferably subjected to heat treatment with microwaves before the heat treatment with high-temperature and high-velocity air stream and before or after the heat treatment with superheated steam. It is to be noted that the heat treatment with microwaves refers to heating by the interaction between microwaves and the potato slices, that is, heating by absorption of microwaves by the potato slices due to dielectric loss, and conversion of their energy to heat.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">When the heat treatment with superheated steam and the heat treatment with microwaves are performed in combination, heating with microwaves is considered to contribute particularly to heating of inside of the potato slices, and heating with superheated steam is considered to contribute particularly to heating of surface of the potato slices. Therefore, performing both the heat treatments is estimated to further improve the conditions of the potato slices after heating leading to puffing.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In the present invention, the heat treatment with superheated steam is preferably performed once or more at a temperature of about 120°C or higher but 300°C or less for about 10 seconds to 2 minutes at a time. When microwaves with a power of about 500 to 1000 W are used, the heat treatment with microwaves is preferably performed once or more for about 10 seconds to 2 minutes at a time. Further, the heat treatment with high-temperature and high-velocity air stream is preferably performed by blowing, onto the potato slices, air stream at a temperature of about 150°C or higher and an air velocity of about 40 m/s or higher for about 60 seconds to 5 minutes without burning the potato slices. It is to be noted that when a reduction in the amount of production of acrylamide is desired, the temperature of the air stream blown onto the potato slices is preferably about 250°C or less.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The present invention is directed also to potato chips produced by the above production method. The potato chips can have an oil content of 15 wt% or less, and are therefore healthy potato chips having a crispy texture and a low calorie content.</p>
    <heading id="h-00008-en">
      <b>Advantageous Effects of Invention</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">According to the method for producing potato chips of the present invention, it is possible to obtain potato chips that are produced without frying in oil and therefore have a significantly reduced oil content even when oil is applied to potato slices in the course of production, but have a crispy texture comparable to that of fried potato chips. Here, the crispy texture refers to a texture such that food is readily broken into pieces when taken into the mouth and the pieces do not remain in the mouth.</p>
    <heading id="h-00009-en">
      <b>Description of Embodiments</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The present invention will be described in detail with reference to a production process. In the present invention, thin slices of raw potatoes are used as a raw material. Raw potatoes are washed, peeled if necessary, trimmed, and cut into thin slices with a slicer or the like. The thickness of the slices is preferably about 0.8 mm to 3.0 mm, particularly preferably about 1.0 mm to 1.4 mm in terms of the texture or the like of a product. It is to be noted that raw potatoes may be cut into slices having smooth surfaces, but may also be cut into slices having a W-shaped cross section.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">These potato slices may be used directly. Alternatively, these potato slices may be previously immersed in cold or hot water and then dewatered to wash away starch from the surface of the potato slices and prevent discoloration caused by long-time exposure to air.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Oil is preferably applied to the potato slices. Oil has a higher boiling point than water. Therefore, the potato slices can be efficiently heated to a temperature exceeding 100°C in a heating step, to be described later, by adhering oil to the potato slices so that the product can have a texture close to that of fried potato chips. The application of oil is preferably performed before heat treatment involving blowing high-temperature and high-velocity air stream to be described later. That is, the application of oil may be performed before or after heating with superheated steam to be described later or before or after heating with microwaves that is performed if necessary, or may be performed at two or more time points of them.</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The oil to be applied is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include rice refined oil and palm olein oil. The amount of the oil to be applied may be as small as about 1% of the weight of the potato slices. In order to obtain potato chips having a low oil content and a good texture as a product, the oil is particularly preferably applied in an amount of about 1.5 to 5 wt%. A method for adhering the oil may be appropriately selected from, for example, spraying, coating, and immersion.</p>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In the present invention, the thus prepared potato slices or potato slices with oil are heated with superheated steam. The superheated steam can be used at 100°C or more. However, the heating with superheated steam is preferably performed at about 120 to 300°C, particularly preferably about 180 to 210°C for about 20 seconds to 1 minute. By heating the potato slices with high-temperature superheated steam in this way, the potato slices can be gelatinized and quickly heated.</p>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">However, when continuously heated with high-temperature superheated steam, the potato slices are quickly dried due to a large amount of heat of the superheated steam, and therefore a crispy texture cannot be achieved. Therefore, in order to prevent the potato slices from being excessively dried, the potato slices may be repeatedly taken in and out of a steam chamber, or moisture may be supplied more than once by, for example, showering water during the heating with superheated steam.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Further, heating with microwaves may also be performed before or after the heating with superheated steam. A means for heating with microwaves is not particularly limited, and an example thereof includes a microwave oven. In the case of 500 W (10 to 20 g of the potato slices), the heating with microwaves is preferably performed for about 10 to 30 seconds, particularly preferably about 20 seconds. By heating the potato slices with microwaves in this way, the potato slices are uniformly gelatinized and quickly heated. It is to be noted that when the potato slices are subjected to the heat treatment with microwaves, the heat treatment with microwaves is preferably performed before the heat treatment with superheated steam from the viewpoint of achieving a crispy texture.</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">After the heating step and the application of oil, the potato slices are then heated and puffed by blowing high-temperature and high-velocity air stream thereonto. The potato slices are estimated to be puffed to some extent also during the heating with microwaves or superheated steam, but are most puffed during the heating with high-temperature and high-velocity air stream. However, in the case of the present invention, the potato slices are not sufficiently puffed or are non-uniformly puffed unless the heat treatment involving blowing high-temperature and high-velocity air stream is performed in combination with the heating with superheated steam, and as a result the product cannot have a crispy texture. Further, when oil is applied to the potato slices, the potato slices are heated to a temperature exceeding 100°C during the heat treatment with high-temperature and high-velocity air stream, which is considered as a factor for further giving the product texture and flavor like a fried product.</p>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The heat treatment involving blowing high-temperature and high-velocity air stream may be performed at at least 100°C so that the potato slices are puffed. However, in order to achieve a more preferred texture, the heat treatment involving blowing high-temperature and high-velocity air stream is preferably performed at a temperature of about 180°C or higher and an air velocity of about 50 m/s or higher, particularly preferably at a temperature of about 200°C or higher for, for example, about 1 minute and 30 seconds to 5 minutes to the extent that potato chips do not burn. More specifically, when the temperature and air velocity of the air stream are about 200°C and about 60 m/s, respectively, the heat treatment may be performed for, for example, about 3 minutes. When the temperature of the air stream is less than about 150°C, the product is likely to have a bad texture. Further, when the air velocity of the air stream is about 40 m/s or less, the potato slices are less likely to puff so that the final product has a hard texture. Further, when a reduction in the production of acrylamide is desired, the potato slices are preferably puffed and dried at about 250°C or less to the extent that potato chips do not burn.</p>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">A device for generating such high-temperature and high-velocity air stream as described above is not particularly limited as long as the potato slices can be puffed and dried. However, a device is preferred in which air stream supplied from a fan is jetted through a number of slit- or tube-shaped jet nozzles provided above a conveyor that runs through a drier to blow high-velocity hot air onto an object on the conveyor. More specifically, a device disclosed in <patcit id="pcit-00008" dnum="JP9210554A"><text>JP-A-9-210554</text></patcit> or <patcit id="pcit-00009" dnum="JP2003090681A"><text>JP-A-2003-90681</text></patcit> or a vertical air impingement-type device (e.g., THERMOZONE (registered trademark) manufactured by ARAKAWA CO., LTD.) is used.</p>
    <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In this way, the potato slices may be puffed and dried by the heat treatment with high-temperature and high-velocity air stream to produce potato chips. However, the potato chips are likely to burn when such high-temperature air stream is continuously blown thereonto. For this reason, after subjected to the heat treatment with high-temperature and high-velocity air stream, the potato slices are preferably further subjected to final drying by reducing the temperature of the air stream or by a conventional hot-air drying method performed at about 80 to 120°C, preferably 100°C or less. If necessary, the final drying may be performed in combination with another drying method. The potato slices are preferably dried until their final moisture content is reduced to about 3% or less.</p>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">After the drying, the potato chips may be seasoned by spraying a small amount of seasoning oil and sprinkling salt, spices, or the like. The thus obtained seasoned or non-seasoned potato chips are provided as a final product preferably hermetically sealed in a bag or a package of an aluminum-evaporated film or the like, impervious to oxygen and moisture.</p>
    <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The thus produced potato chips according to the present invention are non-fried potato chips, and therefore can have a lower oil content of about 25% or less as compared to fried potato chips while having flavor and texture comparable to those of the fried potato chips. Further, although the texture is different from that of fried potato chips, the potato chips according to the present invention can have an oil content as low as about 1% while having a flavor that is not significantly different from that of the fried potato chips. Further, the potato chips according to the present invention can have an oil content as low as about 2% while having a preferred texture. That is, the oil content of the product can be reduced to 1/2 or less to 1/20 of that of fried potato chips, which makes it possible to significantly reduce the calorie of the product. Further, the amount of production of acrylamide, which is a problem for fried potato chips, is very small.</p>

    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Potatoes (breed: TOYOSHIRO) suitable for potato chips were washed, peeled with a peeler, and cut into slices having a thickness of 1.0 mm to 1.1 mm with a slicer. The potato slices were spread, and palm olein oil was sprayed onto the potato slices in an amount of 2 wt% of the weight of the potato slices. Twenty grams of the potato slices were placed in a microwave oven with an output power of 500 W without overlapping more than the 2 potato slices and heated with microwaves for 20 seconds.</p>
    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">After the heating with microwaves, the potato slices were heated for 30 seconds with superheated steam in a steam chamber to which the superheated steam was supplied at a steam flow rate of 180 kg/h so that the temperature of the superheated steam impinging on the surface of the potato slices was 190°C. Then, the potato slices were heat-treated by blowing high-temperature and high-velocity air stream with a maximum air velocity of 60 m/s and a temperature of 200°C onto them for 3 minutes using a high-temperature and high-velocity air stream heat treatment device (THERMOZONE (registered trademark) manufactured by ARAKAWA CO., LTD., fluidized bed (air bed)-type heat treatment device) equipped with a number of thin tube-shaped jet nozzles located above a conveyor. Finally, the potato slices were subjected to final drying for 60 minutes in a hot-air drier at a temperature of 85°C and an air velocity of 4 m/s until their moisture content was reduced to 2% to produce non-fried potato chips.</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The oil content of the non-fried potato chips of Example 1 was measured and found to be 8%. The non-fried potato chips of Example 1 had a calorie content of 414 kcal/100 g. That is, the oil and calorie contents of the non-fried potato chips of Example 1 were significantly reduced as compared to a commercially-available common fried product (oil content: about 40%, calorie content: 570 kcal/100 g).</p>

More specifically, oil was sprayed onto potato slices in the same manner as in Example 1, and then the potato slices were heated for 30 seconds with superheated steam in a steam chamber to which the superheated steam was supplied at a steam flow rate of 180 kg/h so that the temperature of the superheated steam impinging on the surface of the potato slices was 190°C. Then, the potato slices were once taken out of the chamber. After 10 seconds, the potato slices were again heated for 30 seconds with superheated steam in a steam chamber to which the superheated steam was supplied at a steam flow rate of 180 kg/h so that the temperature of the superheated steam impinging on the surface of the potato slices was 190°C.
