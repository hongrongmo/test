In certain embodiments, the modified pectin is de-esterified and partially depolymerized, so as to have a disrupted rhamnogalacturonan backbone. The compositions are preferably aqueous solutions containing at least 0.5%, 1%, 5% or 10% by weight of the modified pectin, e.g., up to about 10% or 15% by weight. In another embodiment, the modified pectin forms a colloidal solution in water. The size of the colloidal particles may be less than 1 Âµm in diameter, preferably less than 0.65 Âµm, and most preferably less than 0.2 Âµm.</p>

    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">A modified pectin as described or produced herein may consist essentially of a homogalacturonan backbone with small amounts of rhamnogalacturonan therein, wherein the backbone has neutral sugar side chains having a low degree of branching dependent from the backbone. In certain embodiments, the galacturonic acid subunits of the backbone are partially deesterified, and in particular embodiments, the galacturonic acid subunits of the backbone are substantially de-esterified.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The compositions as described or produced herein may be formulated as pharmaceutical composition further comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.

      <u>I. OVERVIEW</u>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The present invention discloses methods for the production of modified pectins with therapeutic effects, e.g., against cancer cells. As described herein, pectin can be modified by chemical, physical and/or biological, including enzymatic, means.</p>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The invention also describes compositions composed in part or entirely of modified pectin that are suitable for the treatment of cancer. By way of example, useful compositions of modified pectin include dry powders, suspensions, gels or aqueous solutions. These compositions may consist essentially of modified pectin without any excipients, or they may be in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.</p>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">A modified pectin composition of the present invention comprises or consists essentially of a homogalacturonan backbone with small amounts of rhamnogalacturonan I interspersed therein, with neutral sugar side chains, and has a low degree of neutral sugar branching dependent from the backbone. In certain embodiments, the modified pectin is de-esterified and partially depolymerized, so as to have a disrupted homogalacturonan backbone.</p>
    <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Modified pectin can be administered by any of a variety of routes. Examples of such delivery methods include oral suspensions, gels, and tablets, injectable solutions (intravenous, intraperitoneal), inhalable powders, and suspensions. Preferred compositions are aqueous solutions, oral tablets, and gels.</p>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">As used herein, the term "modified pectin" herein refers to any pectin that has been structurally modified, e.g., by chemical, physical, or biological (including enzymatic) means, or by some combination thereof. Non-limiting examples of such modification to the pectin structure include (but are not limited to) de-esterification, hydrolysis, oxidation and/or reduction of sugar moieties, functionalization of sugar moieties, conformational changes, and changes in molecular weight, linkage, and states of aggregation. In preferred embodiments, the structural modification includes one or more of de-esterification and hydrolysis. In other preferred embodiments, the structural modification includes reduction in particle size and/or aggregation states.</p>
    <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Modified pectin may be produced by chemical means, e.g., any chemical reaction or process that disrupts or changes chemical bonds of the pectin structure, such as covalent or ionic bonds. By way of example only, chemical bonding may be disrupted or formed by catalysis, hydrolysis, substitution, elimination, reduction, oxidation, and radical reactions. In certain embodiments, modified pectin according to the invention is produced by a process that includes hydrolysis, which is preferably catalyzed, e.g., by an acidic or basic reagent or both.</p>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Pectin may also be modified by physical means. Physical means are meant to include non-chemical or -biological means that alter the structure of pectin. Such physical means include, but are not limited to heat, cold, freeze/thaw, irradiation, shear, ultra-high shear, use of cosolvents, and filtration.</p>
    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Pectin may also be modified by biological means. Biological means are meant to include by way of example, enzymatic degradation of pectin. Finally, the invention contemplates the preparation of modified pectin by synthetic and/or recombinant methods. Like the production of recombinant proteins, complex polysaccharides might be engineered via a series of synthetic reactions or by recombinant methods.</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In certain embodiments, pectin may be modified by a combination of the foregoing methods, such as chemical modification followed by physical or biological modification.</p>
    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Typically, processes for making modified pectin result in a mixture of modified pectin and a number of impurities such as low molecular weight byproducts, salts, co-solvents and inactive modified pectin. In certain embodiments of the invention, these impurities are acceptable and are not removed from the modified pectin. In other embodiments, the impurities are either reduced or removed entirely from the modified pectin composition. According to the invention, impurities can be removed by methods known in the art.

Such lyophilized compositions may optionally comprise additives, such as wetting agents and sugars, to promote dissolution.</p>
    <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In certain embodiments, the invention provides a process for dissolving dry pectin in water at the beginning of the modification process. The process of dissolving the pectin in water is not straightforward, due to the unusual properties of dry hydrocolloid powders. Upon contact with water, the pectin particles rapidly swell and become sticky, and they tend to crowd against and adhere to any neighboring particles. The result is a sticky mass that dissolves very slowly, due to the limited surface area in contact with the water. It is preferable to keep the particles separated from one another long enough for them to disperse into the water, where the individual particles remain separated and can dissolve much more quickly.</p>
    <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Methods for separating pectin particles at the time of their dispersion in water include, but are not limited to, (a) use of an eductor funnel, (b) addition of a sugar, (c) suspension in a non-solvent, (d) use of high shear, and (e) slow, controlled addition of reagents. In a powder eductor funnel, the pectin particles are separated by a stream of air just before they contact the water. When a dry blend of several parts sugar to one part pectin is dispersed into water, the sugar particles separate the pectin particles, allowing the pectin particles to hydrate and expand without contacting their neighbors. Suspension in a non-solvent, such as vegetable oil, glycerin, ethanol, or corn syrup, results in the pectin particles becoming wetted and separated from one another without swelling or becoming sticky. The suspension is then be added to water with agitation. With the use of high shear, rapidly-moving water separates adhering particles and breaks up any lumps, maintaining a high surface area and enabling quick hydration. In the case of slow controlled addition, pectin may simply be added at a slow controlled rate to a stirring solution of water. Preferably, the rate of addition is sufficiently slow and the mixing speed is sufficiently great to allow the pectin to be rapidly dispersed and hydrated. Controlled pectin addition can be accomplished manually or with the use of a powder addition device, such as an automated solids metering device outfitted with an adjustable rate extruding screw.</p>

      <u>III. METHODS FOR PREPARING MODIFIED PECTINS</u>
    </heading>
    <heading id="h-00010-en">A. Choice of Pectin Starting Material</heading>
    <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Pectin is a major constituent of plant cell walls, and is a combination of at least three principal pectic polysaccharides, which are believed to be covalently linked within the cell wall: homogalacturonan (HG), rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I), and rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II).</p>
    <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">HG is a linear homopolymer of 1,4-linked Î±-D-galacturonic acid, methyl esterified to varying degrees at C-6. Depending on the species of plant, the backbone galacturonic acid units may be C-3 substituted with O-acetyl residues.</p>
    <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">RG-I is a heterologous group of polysaccharides that contain a backbone of the repeating disaccharide [â <i>4</i>)-Î±-D-Gal<i>p</i>A-(1â 2)-<i>Î±</i>-L-Rha<i>p</i>-(1â]. Between 20 and 80% of the Rha<i>p</i> residues are substituted at C-4 with neutral oligosaccharide side chains containing linear and branched Î±-L-Ara<i>f</i> and Î²-D-Gal<i>p</i> residues. The backbone Gal<i>p</i>A residues of RG-I are not typically substituted with polysaccharides, although they may be <i>O</i>-acetylated at C2 or C3.</p>
    <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">RG-II has a more highly conserved structure, with a backbone usually composed of at least seven to nine 1,4-linked a-D-Gal<i>p</i>A residues, to which four complex oligosaccharide side chains are typically attached at C-2 and/or C-3.</p>
    <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">Pectin itself is thought to be a heteropolysaccharide with a backbone composed of alternating HG ("smooth regions") and RG ("hairy regions"). The smooth regions are linear polymers of 1,4-linked Î±-D-galacturonic acid.</p>
    <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">The highly branched "hairy regions" feature neutral sugar units (typically D-galactose or L-arabinose or xylose attached by glycosidic linkages to the C4 atoms of the rhamnose units, and/or to the C2 or C3 atoms of the galacturonic acid units. Depending upon the extraction process used, the hairy regions are partially or largely degraded during the manufacture of commercial pectin, leaving intact the smooth polygalacturonic acid regions, with a smaller number of neutral sugar units still attached to or embedded in the main linear chain. The methyl galacturonate ester groups survive the extraction process, although degree of methyl esterification may be reduced in subsequent processing steps to provide commercial pectins having various utilities.</p>
    <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The degree of methyl esterification in most commercial pectins varies from 0-90%. If 50% or more of the carboxyl groups are esterified the pectin is referred to as a "high ester" or "high methoxyl" pectin". If less than 50% of the carboxyl groups are esterified then the pectin is referred to as a "low ester" or "low methoxyl" pectin. Pectin having few or no esterified groups is referred to as pectic acid.</p>
    <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The choice of the starting pectin material affects the characteristics of the final product. However, in choosing a starting pectin, important things to consider are molecular weight, degree of esterification, monosaccharide content, linkage, polydispersity and so forth. In a preferred embodiment, the starting pectin contains roughly 50-60 mole % esterification or higher, has a molecular weight of greater than 150 kD, and has a particular monosaccharide content, e.g., galactose content, greater than or equal to 5%. In one embodiment of the invention the starting pectin composition may comprise approximately equal amounts of HG and RG-I, preferably at least 70% HG and less than 30% RG-I more preferably at least 80% HG and less than 20% RG-I and most preferably at least 90% HG and less than10% RG-I. In certain embodiments, the pectin may contain 0-10% of RG-II. In certain preferred embodiments, the starting pectin is citrus pectin.</p>
    <heading id="h-00011-en">B. Structural Modification of Pectin</heading>
    <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">According to the invention, the term "modified pectin" herein refers to any changes to the structure of pectin that are brought about by chemical, physical or biological means or by some combination thereof. Non-limiting examples of changes to the pectin structure include (but are not limited to) deesterification, hydrolysis, oxidation and/or reduction of sugar moieties, functionalization of sugar moieties, conformational changes, and changes in molecular weight, linkage, states of aggregation, and particle size.</p>
    <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">In one embodiment, modified pectin has the structure of a pectic acid polymer with some of the pectic side chains still present. In preferred embodiments, the modified pectin is a copolymer of homogalacturonic acid and rhamnogalacturonan I in which some of the galactose- and arabinose-containing sidechains are still attached. The modified pectin may have a molecular weight of 1 to 500 kilodaltons (kD), preferably 10 to 250 kD, more preferably 50-200 kD, 70-175 kD, 70-150 kD, or 80-150 kD, or even 80 to 100 kD as measured by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) with Multi Angle Laser Light Scattering (MALLS) detection.</p>
    <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">Degree of esterification is another characteristic of modified pectins. In certain embodiments, the degree of esterification may be between 0 and 80%, between 10 and 60%, between 0 and 50%, or between 20 and 60%, such as 20-45%, or 30-40% esterification.</p>
    <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">Saccharide content is another characteristic of modified pectins. In certain embodiments, the modified pectin is composed entirely of a single type of saccharide subunit. In other embodiments, the modified pectin comprises at least two, preferably at least three, and most preferably at least four types of saccharide subunits. For example, the modified pectin may be composed entirely of galacturonic acid subunits. Alternatively, the modified pectin may comprise a combination of galacturonic acid and rhamnose subunits. In yet another example, the modified pectin may comprise a combination of galacturonic acid, rhamnose, and galactose subunits. In yet another example, the modified pectin may comprise a combination of galacturonic acid, rhamnose, and arabinose subunits. In still yet another example, the modified pectin may comprise a combination of galacturonic acid, rhamnose, galactose, and arabinose subunits. In some embodiments, the galacturonic acid content of modified pectin is greater than 50%, preferably greater than 60% and most preferably greater than 80%. In some embodiments, the rhamnose content is less than 25%, preferably less than 15% and most preferably less than 10%; the galactose content is less than 50%, preferably less than 40% and most preferably less than 30%; and the arabinose content is less than 15%, preferably less than 10% and most preferably less than 5%. In certain embodiments, the modified pectin may contain other uronic acids, xylose, ribose, lyxose, glucose, allose, altrose, idose, talose, gluose, mannose, fructose, psicose, sorbose or talalose in addition to the saccharide units mentioned above.</p>
    <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">Modified pectin suitable for use in the subject methods may also have any of a variety of linkages or a combination thereof. By linkages it is meant the sites at which the individual sugars in pectin are attached to one another. In some embodiments, the modified pectin comprises only a single type of linkage. In certain preferred embodiments, the modified pectin comprises at least two types of linkages, and most preferably at least 3 types of linkages. For example, the modified pectin may comprise only alpha-1,4 linked galacturonic acid subunits. Alternatively, the modified pectin may comprise alpha-1,4-linked galacturonic acid subunits and alpha-1,2-rhamnose subunits. In another example, the modified pectin maybe composed of alpha-1,4-linked galacturonic acid subunits and alpha-1,2-rhamnose subunits linked through the 4 position to arabinose subunits. In another example, the modified pectin may comprise alpha-1,4-linked galacturonic acid subunits and alpha- ,2-rhamnose subunits linked through the 4 position to arabinose subunits with additional 3-linked arabinose subunits. In another example, the modified pectin may comprise alpha-1,4-linked galacturonic acid subunits and alpha-1,2-rhamnose subunits linked through the 4 position to arabinose subunits with additional 5-linked arabinose units. In another example, the modified pectin may comprise alpha-1,4-linked galacturonic acid subunits and alpha-1,2-rhamnose subunits linked through the 4 position to arabinose subunits with additional 3-linked and 5-linked arabinose subunits. In another example, the modified pectin may comprise alpha-1,4-linked galacturonic acid subunits and alpha-1,2-rhamnose subunits linked through the 4 position to arabinose subunits with additional 3-linked and 5-linked arabinose subunits with 3,5-linked arabinose branch points. In another example, the modified pectin may comprise alpha-1,4-linked galacturonic acid subunits and alpha-1,2-rhamnose subunits linked through the 4 position to galactose subunits. In another example, the modified pectin may comprise alpha-1,4-linked galacturonic acid subunits and alpha-1,2-rhamnose subunits linked through the 4 position to galactose subunits with additional 3-linked galactose subunits. In another example, the modified pectin may comprise alpha-1,4-linked galacturonic acid subunits and alpha-1,2-rhamnose subunits linked through the 4 position to galactose subunits with additional 4-linked galactose subunits. In another example, the modified pectin may comprise alpha-1,4-linked galacturonic acid subunits and alpha-1,2-rhamnose subunits linked through the 4 position to galactose subunits with additional 3-linked galactose subunits with 3,6-linked branch points. In another example, the modified pectin may comprise alpha-1,4-linked galacturonic acid subunits and alpha-1,2-rhamnose subunits linked through the 4 position to galactose subunits with additional 4-linked galactose subunits with 4,6-linked branch points. In certain embodiments, the side chains of the modified pectin may comprise uronic acids, galacaturonic acid, glucuronic acid, rhamnose, xylose, ribose, lyxose, glucose, allose, altrose, idose, talose, gluose, mannose, fructose, psicose, sorbose or talalose in addition to the saccharide units described above.</p>

      <u>Modification by Chemical Methods</u>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">Modified pectin may be produced by chemical means. By chemical means it is meant to include any chemical reaction or process that disrupts or changes chemical bonding of the pectin structure. Chemical bonding includes any bonding which is readily known in the art. By way of example this may include covalent or ionic bonds. Chemical reactions include any reaction known in the art and include those that either directly or indirectly alter chemical bonds. By way of example only, chemical bonding may be disrupted or formed by catalysis, hydrolysis, substitution, elimination, reduction, oxidation, and radical reactions. In certain embodiments, modified pectin according to the invention is produced by a process that includes hydrolysis, which is preferably catalyzed, e.g., by an acidic or basic reagent or both.</p>
    <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">In one preferred embodiment, an aqueous solution of pectin is modified by the action of alkaline conditions. Under these conditions, the original pectin structure may undergo several changes. Non-limiting examples include deesterification of the methylated galacturonic acid residues, cleavage of the galacturonic acid backbone, cleavage of the branch points, as well as conformational changes, for example from random coil to rigid rod, or change in aggregation state.</p>
    <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">In another preferred embodiment an aqueous pectin solution is modified by the action of acidic conditions. Under these conditions, the structure of pectin may undergo several changes. These changes include, but are not limited to, deesterification, hydrolysis of the backbone, branch points or side chains, conformational changes, for example from rigid rod to random coil, and changes in aggregation state.</p>
    <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">In yet another more preferred embodiment, an aqueous pectin solution is treated sequentially to alkaline conditions followed by acidic conditions or vice versa.</p>
    <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">In another embodiment, pectin is modified by the addition of salts. In one embodiment divalent salts such as calcium or magnesium are used to increase the molecular weight of the modified pectin by ionic bonding. In another embodiment, high salt concentrations are used to cause conformational changes to the pectin structure by interrupting intramolecular ionic and hydrogen bonding.</p>

Physical means are meant to include non-chemical or biological means that alter the structure of pectin. Such physical means might include, but are not limited to heat, cold, freeze/thaw, irradiation, shear, ultra-high shear, addition of cosolvents and other ionic disrupting compounds, and filtration. In one embodiment, the particle size polydisperisty of a colloidal solution of modified pectin is reduced by the use of microfiltration. Particularly, a solution of modified pectin may be filtered using tangential flow filtration comprising a particular membrane type and pore size. In another embodiment, a modified pectin solution may be combined with a second solvent such as ethanol to compress the particle size by reduction of hydration prior to filtration.</p>
    <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">The choice of filter pore size and membrane type, the amount of cosolvent, the pH, and concentration depend on the degree of polydispersity desired.

    <heading id="h-00016-en">C. Methods of Controlling Therapeutic Effectiveness</heading>
    <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">The therapeutic effectiveness of modified pectin can be controlled by several methods including controlling molecular weight and particle size polydispersity, the degree of esterification, the average molecular weight, the pH, and the charge density. In one embodiment, the therapeutic effectiveness of a modified pectin is increased by reducing the particle size polydispersity by means of microfiltration. In a preferred embodiment, the microfiltration is tangential flow filtration. The degree of therapeutic effectiveness can be increased or decreased based upon the filtration conditions utilized. In particular, the filtration feed and filtration parameters can be adjusted to control the degree of therapeutic activity of the modified pectin. In general, the therapeutic activity of a modified pectin can be increased by one or a combination of the following parameters: adjusting the filtration feed to a lower pH prior to filtration, increasing the concentration of the modified pectin in the filtration feed, adding a cosolvent such as ethanol or increasing the ratio of filtration membrane surface area to weight of filtered product. The invention contemplates that additional parameters or other means can be employed to achieve the same result. For example, ultrasonication or high shear methods may also be employed to create smaller particle sizes.</p>

      <u>Methods of Controlling Molecular Weight</u>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">The molecular weight of modified pectin may also be controlled, e.g., increased or decreased. Increases in molecular weight may be brought about by formation of ionic interactions, hydrogen bonds, covalent bonds, or some combination thereof.</p>
    <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">Decreases in molecular weight may be brought about by interruption of ionic interactions, hydrogen bonds, or covalent bonds, e.g., by acid-catalysed hydrolysis, base-catalyzed cleavage, or some combination thereof. In one embodiment of the invention, the molecular weight of pectin or modified pectin is reduced by hydrolysis of the covalent linkages of main backbone, hydrolytic removal of the side chains, or some combination thereof. In a specific example, the molecular weight is reduced by increasing the pH of an aqueous solution of pectin. The rate of the hydrolysis is controlled by pH and time. In one method, the pH of the solution is between 7-13. In a preferred method, the pH of the solution is between 8.5-11.5, more preferably between 10-11.</p>
    <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">In certain embodiments, the molecular weight is reduced by increasing the temperature of either dry pectin, solutions of pectin, or suspensions of pectin. The rate of decrease in molecular weight is controlled by temperature and time. In one method the temperature is between 50 and 200 Â°C, more preferably between 80 and 150 Â°C and most preferably between 95 and 125 Â°C. When decreasing the molecular weight using heat, the type of vessel used may affect the rate of the reaction. For example, when heating a solution it may be optimal to conduct the heating in a closed vessel. This closed system will not allow loss of volume, but must be able to withstand the vapor pressure generated by the reaction. Additionally, the presence of oxygen (either dissolved or atmospheric) may cause unwanted side reactions, such as oxidation. This can be avoided by running the reaction in a closed vessel under vacuum or purged with nitrogen, or by other methods known in the art.</p>
    <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">In certain embodiments, molecular weight may be affected by irradiation. High-energy radiation such as gamma irradiation is known to cause the scission or formation of new bonds through the formation of radicals. The degree of molecular weight modification is dependent on several variables such as intensity of the irradiation, exposure duration, dissolved or atmospheric oxygen, and density of material being irradiated. However, in one method, an aqueous solution of pectin in a closed vessel under vacuum is irradiated for at least 1 minute, preferably at least 10 minutes, more preferably at least 30 minutes and most preferably at least 60 minutes and the intensity of the irradiation is at least 1 kilogray, preferably at least 5 kilogray, more preferably 15 kilogray, and most preferably 25 or more kilogray.</p>
    <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">In certain embodiments, the molecular weight may reduced by shear. Shear may be produced by a number of methods which are known in the art, and may include sonication and high shear mixing.</p>
    <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">In certain embodiments, the molecular weight of a modified pectin may be increased by the action of a chemical crosslinker. In one embodiment, the molecular weight of modified pectin is increased by crosslinking it with a water soluble diamine, such as poly(ethyleneglycol) bisamine using a carbodiimide intermediate.</p>
    <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">Depending on the final product desired, the above methods for modulating the molecular weight may be performed individually or in some combination.</p>

    <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">In some instances it may be desirable to optimize the final polydispersity of the modified pectin. For example, modified pectins of a particularly narrow molecular weight range or colloidal particle size may give optimal pharmaceutical performance,</p>
    <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">The polydispersity of modified pectin can be controlled by the mechanical removal of products having unwanted molecular weights. In certain embodiments, the unwanted products are eliminated by one or more fractional precipitations. In certain preferred embodiments, unwanted products are removed by either one or a series of ultrafiltrations with differing nominal molecular weight cut-off membranes. Ultrafiltration is a well known process and typically takes place in an aqueous solvent.</p>
    <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">The polydispersity can be reduced by using size exclusion chromatography. In this method, a modified pectin solution is passed through a size exclusion column which differentially separates molecules based on their molecular weight.</p>
    <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">The polydispersity of the modified pectin can be controlled by its method of manufacture. In one such method, the polydispersity of the pectin or modified pectin is decreased by exposing a solution or suspension to ultrahigh shear. The action of shear, especially ultrahigh shear, causes bonds of larger polymers to break preferentially at about the middle of the polymer, leaving smaller polymers intact. This action will result in the preferential formation of smaller polymers of approximately the same size and thus a smaller polydispersity.</p>

    </heading>
    <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">There are a wide variety of enzymes, including some produced by bacteria and fungi, that selectively fragment particular segments of the pectin polysaccharide. Various combinations of these enzymes may be employed to remove methyl esters, individual sugars, side chains, or sections of the backbone as desired. Enzymes that can be used alone or in combination to alter monosaccharide composition include, for example, rhamnogalacturonase, rhamnogalacturonan lyase, rhamnogalacturonan-rhamnohydrolase, rhamnogalacturonan-galacturonohydrolase, endo and exo galacturonases, arabinases, pectin methyl esterases, and galactanases.</p>
    <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">The monsaccharide content of modified pectin can be controlled by the conversion of one type of monosaccharide moiety into another. In one embodiment of the invention, the galacturonic acid content of the modified pectin is reduced by the selective chemical reduction of the carboxyl on C-6 of galacturonic acid to form galactose. The monosaccharide content can also be affected by the source of the pectin starting material, as discussed above.</p>

    <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">Typically, the processes of making modified pectin result in a mixture of modified pectin and a number of impurities such as low molecular weight byproducts, salts, co-solvents and inactive modified pectin. In certain embodiments of the invention, these impurities are acceptable and modified pectin is not further purified or isolated. In other more preferred embodiments, the impurities are either reduced or removed entirely from the modified pectin composition.</p>

    <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">Impurities may be separated from modified pectin by screen filtration, microfiltration, ultrafiltration, or a combination thereof. For example, microfiltration of an aqueous modified pectin solution can be used to remove insoluble materials from the solution, while salts and low molecular weight byproducts can be removed by using ultrafiltration. The choice of the membrane and its nominal molecular weight cut-off depends on the molecular size of the impurities which are to be removed and the molecular weight of the modified pectin product desired. In certain embodiments, a solution of modified pectin is purified by screen filtration using a 5 Âµm filter screen, by micro filtration through a 0.2 Âµm filter, by ultrafiltration through a 30 kilodalton ultra-filter, or any combination of these.</p>

Sizing can include fractionation of different particle sizes, molecular weight, particle or molecular shape. The method may further include sterile filtration, addition of sterile filling, removal of endotoxins, lyophilization, or any combination of these steps. Preferably, all of these additional steps are performed.</p>
    <p id="p-00112-en" num="0112">In certain embodiments of the above described method, dissolving the pectin comprises providing a slurry of pectin in a water-miscible organic solvent and combining the slurry with water to dissolve the pectin. The use of a slurry of pectin in a water-miscible organic solvent accelerates the dissolution and/or prevents the aerial dispersion of pectin particles that occurs when dry pectin is added directly to an aqueous solvent.

        <u>EXAMPLE 1: PREPARATION OFMODIFIED PECTIN.</u>
      </i>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00145-en" num="0145">Citrus fruit pectin (800 g) was added (at a rate of about 15 g/min) with vigorous stirring to water (89 liters). Following addition of the pectin, the mixture was stirred for approximately 1 hour until the pectin appeared dissolved. The solution was then rapidly adjusted to pH 10.7 by the addition of ~10 N NaOH solution, and stirred at about 27 Â°C) for 20 minutes, while maintaining pH 10.7 using ~10 N NaOH. Following this the solution pH was adjusted to pH 3.0 by gradual addition of 3 M HCl and maintained for 10 minutes. The pH was then adjusted to 6.3 using 10 M and 1M NaOH and maintained for 10 minutes.</p>
    <p id="p-00146-en" num="0146">The resulting solution was then transferred into a 70% ethanol solution to precipitate the modified pectin. The precipitate was then isolated by screen filtration and washed with a 70% ethanol solution.</p>
    <p id="p-00147-en" num="0147">The precipitate was then dissolved in water, adjusted to 5 mg/mL modified pectin, 15% w/w ethanol and pH 6.5. The resulting solution was then filtered through a 0.2 Âµm tangential flow filter. This was followed by ultrafiltration and diafiltration through a 30 kD membrane to concentrate the modified pectin and reduce low molecular weight impurities including ethanol. The solution was then diluted with water to a final modified pectin concentration of 5 mg/mL.</p>
    <p id="p-00148-en" num="0148">This final solution was then filtered through 0.2 Âµm filters and filled into sterile glass vials. The modified pectin composition obtained by this process exhibited an ethanol content of less than 1%, an average molecular weight of approximately 90 kD as judged by a multiangle, light-scattering chromatography method, a modified pectin concentration of 5 Â± 0.5 mg/mL as determined by a size exclusion chromatography method. The composition was tested by the cancer Cell Apoptosis and DNA Synthesis Inhibition models described in Example 4 and 5, respectively, and found to be highly effective in both, with an average IC<sub>50</sub> = 50 Âµg/mL.</p>

Modified pectin was fractionated by size using microfiltration. <figref>Figure 1</figref> demonstrates that the samples prepared using different microfiltration pore sizes have different therapeutic effectiveness. In the range used in this experiment, the largest pore size (0.7 Âµm) had the least therapeutic effect while the smallest pore size (0.1 Âµm) had the most therapeutic effect, as determined by the Cell Apoptosis model.</p>

In the range used in this experiment, the samples prepared from lower feed pH demonstrated higher therapeutic effect, as determined by the Cell Apoptosis model.</p>
    <p id="p-00151-en" num="0151">Another factor that influences the therapeutic effectiveness of modified pectin is the ethanol content of the microfiltration feed. <figref>Figure 3</figref> demonstrates the effect of microfiltration feed ethanol content on therapeutic effectiveness.

    </heading>
    <p id="p-00154-en" num="0154">An experimental model to assess a potential anti-cancer agent is Cell Apoptosis Therapeutic Model. In this model, cancer cell apoptosis was demonstrated using an <i>in vitro</i> bioactivity assay. The test is qualitative and is based on the observation that modified pectin inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells such as B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells and induces cancer cell apoptosis. This effect can be measured by using a mitochondrial enzyme indicator such as AlamarBlueâ¢ (BioSource), which is formulated to quantitatively measure the proliferation or viability of a variety of human or animal cells in the presence of adding toxic compounds. It consists of an oxidation-reduction (REDOX) indicator that yields a colorimetric change and a fluorescent signal in a response to the cell innate metabolic activity change, thereby providing an indirect measure of viable cell number. By testing several concentrations of the modified pectin, it is possible to calculate an IC<sub>50</sub> for the compound measured in Âµg/milliliter and the smaller the IC<sub>50</sub> the greater the therapeutic effect.</p>
    <p id="p-00155-en" num="0155">B16F10 cells were seeded into the wells of 96-well plates in growth media. After cells attached to the plates, 0, 5, 50, or 150 Âµl/ml of sterile 4-chlorodiazepam and 100 Âµl/ml of a sample to be tested were applied to the cells. The cells were incubated to allow viable cells to proliferate, and the media was replaced with fresh media supplemented with 10% AlamarBlueâ¢. The cells were further incubated, then the state of oxidation of AlamarBlueâ¢ was determined by spectrophotometry and adjusted for blanks. The more reduced AlamarBlueâ¢ was, the higher the proportion of the cells that underwent apoptosis.</p>

B16-F10 cells were grown in a 50:50 v/v media composed of EMEM and Leibovitz L-15 (both from Cambrex Bio Science, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Bioscience, Lenexa KS), glutamine (JRH Bioscience), and pencillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were seeded at 3,000/well in 96-well white-walled, clear bottom microtiter plates (Coming Life Sciences, Acton, MA) and grown for 24h. The supernatant was removed and replaced with the MCP's dissolved in the supplemented 50:50 media. BrdU was added immediately following the agents. After 24h agent and BrdU exposure, the cells were fixed and BrdU was detected with peroxidase-conjugated anti-BrdU.
