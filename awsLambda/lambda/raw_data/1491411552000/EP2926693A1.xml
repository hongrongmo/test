      <u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to chairs, and more particularly to a chair configured to provide multi-posture seating.</p>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Various designs for office chairs have been developed, offering ergonomic improvements to individuals who spend much of their workday at a desk in a seated position. Many chairs include a height adjustment for moving the seat portion of the chair up and down so as to accommodate individuals of different heights and sizes and/or the height of the desk being utilized. Other chairs are designed such that the angle of the seat portion can be tilted and adjusted to the individual's preference. Generally, office chairs are designed to support an individual in a sitting position; however, stools that have a wide range of height adjustability have been used to give a user the ability to work in either a sitting or a standing posture.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">
      <u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention provides the comfort and adjustability characteristics of a task chair while also converting to a stand-up perch. More particularly, the present invention provides an office-type chair including a base, a height-adjustable pedestal that projects generally vertically upward, and a seat-back arrangement including a seat assembly and a back assembly. The seat assembly includes a seat surface and a flange extending from a forward edge of the seat surface at an angle relative to the seat surface. The seat assembly is adapted to pivot between a first generally horizontal position and a second generally vertical position. In the first position the seat surface is generally horizontal and functions as a task chair, and in the second position the seat surface is generally vertical and the flange functions as a perch.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In one embodiment, in the first position the flange is angled rearward, such that a lower edge of the flange is positioned rearward of the forward edge of the seat surface.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In one embodiment, the seat assembly includes a seat pan, a pivot rod disposed along a rear portion of the seat pan, and a ramp disposed at a rear corner of the seat pan. The pivot rod is disposed within the carrier and is adapted to be received within the end cap channel and to travel along the channel as the seat assembly transitions from the first position to the second position.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In another embodiment, the chair includes a pair of spaced armrests pivotally mounted to the seat assembly, each armrest is pivotal between a first armrest position and a second armrest position. The chair is positionable in a seated position and a perched position. In the seated position the seat surface and armrests are in their respective horizontal and first armrest positions and the chair functions as a task chair. In the perched position, the seat surface and armrests are in their respective vertical and second armrest positions and the chair functions as a perch.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In another embodiment, the armrests pivot about a horizontal axis. In the first armrest position, a first surface defines a seated arm resting surface, and in the second position, a second surface defines a perched arm resting surface.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">These and other objects, advantages, and features of the invention will be more fully understood and appreciated by reference to the description of the current embodiments and the drawings.</p>

      <u>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE CURRENT EMBODIMENT</u>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Referring to Figs. 1-4, an office-type chair 10 is shown in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The chair 10 is a multi-posture chair that is configured to be positioned into multiple seating arrangements, including a sitting or seated position and a leaning or perched position. Both the seated and perched positions can be adjusted to different heights as desired. The different seated and perched positions enable a worker or employee to assume multiple physical positions during the work day, which may increase the employee's level of comfort. The chair 10 can also be used in conjunction with a height adjustable table, which are increasing in popularity along with attention to improved ergonomics, allowing both sitting and perched postures to be supported with a single chair solution.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In the illustrated embodiment, the multi-posture chair 10 includes a support base 12, a height-adjustable and upwardly projecting pedestal 14, and a seat-back arrangement 16 that includes a seat assembly 18 and a back assembly 20. The seat assembly 18 includes a seat surface 22 and a perch flange 24. In one embodiment, the flange 24 extends down from a lower surface 25 of the forward edge 26 of the seat assembly 18, and is positioned at an angle Î± relative to an underside of the seat surface 22, as shown in <figref>Fig. 1</figref>. Stated differently, the flange 24 may be angled relative to vertical, such that a lower edge 28 of the flange 24 is positioned rearward of the forward edge 26 of the seat assembly 18. In one embodiment, the angle Î± may be varied from application to application, depending on the desired characteristics of the perch seating surface, which is described in more detail below. In an alternative embodiment, the flange 24 may extend substantially vertical, such that the angle Î± is approximately 90 degrees.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The support base 12 is rotatably mounted, via the pedestal 14, to the seat back arrangement 16 and seat assembly 18, and includes a number of radially extending arms 30, each having a caster 32 mounted to a distal end thereof. In the exemplary embodiment, four arms 30 and casters 32 are illustrated; however, more or fewer arms and casters are contemplated. Additionally, the casters 32 may be reverse braking casters that resist movement when weight is applied to the caster 32, as are commercially available and known to those skilled in the art. The arms 30 are arranged in a configuration that is symmetrical about one axis and asymmetrical about a second, substantially perpendicular axis. This arrangement of the support base 12 increases the stability of the chair 10, particularly when used in the perched configuration. In particular, rotation of the support base 12 (relative to the seat back arrangement 16) may be limited within a range to ensure stability given the asymmetrical base support 12. Referring to <figref>Figs. 9A-C</figref>, an exemplary range of rotation is shown, where the seat back arrangement 16 may be rotated 60Â° in either direction. Of course, a lesser or greater degree of rotation is contemplated.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The pedestal 14 includes a vertical adjustment mechanism (not shown) for vertically adjusting the height of the chair 10. The vertical adjustment mechanism may include a conventional hydraulic adjustment mechanism such as the type known to those skilled in the art for use in office chairs, wherein a first lower sleeve fits telescopically within a second upper sleeve, and the upper sleeve is vertically movable with respect to the lower sleeve. Alternatively, the support base may be in the form of a substantially flat panel.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">According to one embodiment, in a seated position A, shown in <figref>Figs. 1</figref> and <figref>2</figref>, the seat assembly 18 is positioned in a first, generally horizontal position and the chair 10 functions as a task chair. In this first, seated position A, the seat surface 22 of the seat assembly is configured to receive the user's buttocks in a seated posture, and the back assembly 20 includes a front seating surface 34 that is configured to receive the user's back.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Referring now to <figref>Fig. 4</figref>, in a second, perched position C, the seat assembly 18 is positioned in a second, generally vertical position and the chair 10 functions as a perch. In this perched position C, the seat assembly 18 and back assembly 20 are folded together and arranged such that the flange 24 is positioned to support the user's buttocks in a substantially standing, semi-seated, or leaning posture. As stated above, in the illustrated embodiment, the flange 24 is angled, therefore the lower edge 28 of the seating surface provided by the flange 24 is lowered relative to horizontal (by an angle complementary to angle Î±). When in the perched position C, it has been found that angling the lower edge 28 of the flange 24 down may provide the user a comfortable leaning, or perched, posture. It is contemplated that angle Î± may be an acute angle. More specifically, angle Î± may be approximately 70Â° to 85Â°. Further, in the perched position C, what portion of the front seating surface 34 of the back assembly 20 that extends above the flange 24 may support the user's back. The flange 24 has a length defined generally between the lower surface 25 of the seat assembly 18 and the lower edge 28 of the flange 24. The flange length is generally sufficient to support a substantial portion of a person when the chair is in the perched position. In one embodiment, the flange length may extend at a desired ratio with respect to the length of the seat surface 22 (defined generally between the front surface 34 of the back assembly 16 and the forward edge 26 of the seat assembly 18). For example, in the embodiment shown in Figs. 1-4, the perch length is about 47% of the seat surface length, and in the embodiment shown in Figs. 11-13 (discussed in more detail below), the perch length is about 58% of the length of the seat surface. In other words, a sufficient perch length for supporting a person in the perched position - without being too heavy for a user to pivot - is generally between about 40% and about 65% of the length of the seat support, and more particularly between about 50% and about 60% of the length of the seat support.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Referring now to <figref>Fig. 2</figref>, the back assembly 20 may include an elongated pocket or carrier 50 disposed on a lower portion thereof. The carrier 50 extends substantially the width of the chair 10, and has a generally hollow and U-shaped cross-section defining an opening 52 at a top portion thereof. An end cap 54 is positioned at each lateral end of the carrier 50, closing off the ends of the carrier 50. The end caps 54 have substantially the same cross-sectional shape as the carrier 50, yet they are not hollow. Referring to <figref>Fig. 5</figref>, the end caps 54 each include, in mirror image relationship to one another, a channel 56 and an angled guide 58. The channel 56 extends vertically along the forward surface of the end cap 54. The angled guide 58 is quadrilateral-shaped protruding member that includes an angled face 60 on a forward surface thereof. Further, the angled guide 58 is positioned interior to the channel 56, also on the forward surface of the end cap 54.</p>

The pivot rod 76 is adapted to travel along the channel 56 as the seat assembly 18 transitions from the seated position A to the perched position C, as shown in <figref>Fig. 8</figref>. The pivot rod 76 slides down the channel 56 until it reaches the bottom of the channel 56 and the ramped surface 80 of the wedge 78 abuts the angled face 60 of the angled guide 58. The interaction between the wedge 78 and the angled guide 58 provides a positive stop and increased stability for the seat assembly 18 when in the perched position C.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The multi-posture chair 10 advantageously allows the user to vary his or her physical position throughout the workday, thereby increasing the employee's comfort. Moreover, the multi-posture chair 10 very easily transitions between the seated and perched positions. Further, as described above, in either of the seated and perched configurations, the seat-back arrangement 16 is readily vertically adjustable to change the height of the sitting or leaning surface. Accordingly, in addition to providing multiple seating arrangements, the chair 10 can accommodate the height of the individual user and/or the associated work surface.</p>
