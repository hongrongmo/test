      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION.</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">Growth factors are substances, including peptides, which affect the growth and differentiation of defined cell populations <i>in vivo</i> or <i>in vitro.</i> Normal bone formation occurs during development, bone remodeling occurs in adult life, and bone repair occurs in order to preserve the integrity of the skeleton. Bone formation, remodeling and repair involve bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts. Cell differentiation and the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are regulated by growth factors. Thus, any interference between the balance in cell differentiation and resorption can affect bone homeostasis, bone formation and repair.</p>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Osteoblasts are derived from a pool of marrow stromal cells (also known as mesenchymal stem cells). MSC are present in a variety of tissues and are prevalent in bone marrow stroma. MSC are pluripotent and can differentiate into chondrogenic or osteogenic cells including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, myocytes, and adipocytes.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The induction of ectopic bone formation by demineralized bone matrix (DBM) has been described. (<nplcit id="ncit-00001" npl-type="s"><text>Urist, M. R.: Bone: Formation by autoinduction. Science 150:893-899, 1965</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit-00002" npl-type="s"><text>Urist, et al., Purification of bovine morphogenetic protein by hydroxyapatite chromatography. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:371-375, 1984</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit-00003" npl-type="b"><text>Urist, M. R. Emerging concepts of bone morphogenetic protein. In Fundamentals of Bone Growth: Methodology and Applications, Boston C.R.C. Press, pp. 189-198, 1991</text></nplcit>.) Further, the properties of the partially purified protein fraction, bone morphogenic protein/non-collagenous protein ("BMP/NCP" or "BMP"s) have been described. (<nplcit id="ncit-00004" npl-type="b"><text>Urist, et al. Methods of Preparation and Bioassay of Bone Morphogenetic Protein and Polypeptide Fragments. In Methods in Enzymology. Vol. 146. New York, Academic Press, pp. 294-312, 1987</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit-00005" npl-type="b"><text>Urist, et al., Hydroxyapatite affinity, electroelution, and radioimmunoassay for identification of human and bovine bone morphogenetic proteins and polypeptides.

    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">BMP/NCP was never purified to homogeneity, but other investigators have used similar starting materials to clone a number of recombinant "BMPs." However several of these molecules have little or no osteogenic activity. "BMPs" and other osteogenic factors have been studied for use in clinical applications. However, the cost of using minimally effective dosages of BMP-7, for example has been a limiting factor in clinical use. Therefore, effective and affordable compositions and methods are desired for clinical applications relating to bone.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The inventions are related to a synthetic peptide designated BMP Binding Peptide (BBP) that avidly binds rhBMP-2. BBP increases the rate and degree to which rhBMP-2 induces bone formation. BBP alone induces calcification of chondrogenic, osteogenic and osteoblastic cells. Compositions and substrates including BBP, antibodies to BBP and methods of using BBP are useful in applications relating to bone.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The invention may include a method of systemic delivery or localized treatment with agents for maintaining bone homeostasis, enhancing bone formation and/or enhancing bone repair.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In one application of the invention, the method may be applied to induce the local repair of bone or to treat bone related disorders, such as osteoporosis.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The invention may also include implants having agents or seeded with pluripotential or differentiated cells for inducing bone formation or repair. The invention may also include the application of substances or differentiated cells at a site where bone formation or bone repair is desired.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">This invention is advantageous at least in that BBP enhances calcification of chondrogenic or osteogenic precursor cells. Further, this invention is advantageous at least in that BBP enhances osteogenesis to occur faster to a greater extent, which may improve the clinical rate and effectiveness of treatment with BMP, and reduce doses and therefore the cost of treatment.</p>

    <heading id="h-00004-en">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">One embodiment of the invention comprises a peptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No: 1a. The bovine derived amino acid SEQ ID No: 1a has been designated BBP, and SEQ ID No: 1b corresponds to the bovine nucleic acid sequence encoding BBP.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">One embodiment of the invention comprises a peptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 12a, which is the sequence of human BBP. SEQ ID No. 12b corresponds to the human nucleic acid sequence encoding human BBP.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">BBP is a 19 amino acid, 2.1kD peptide, derived from a 18.5 kD fragment of a known 24 kDa secreted phosphoprotein ("SPP-24"). SPP-24 is illustrated by SEQ ID No: 2. Notably, SPP-24 inhibits BMP-2 induced bone formation. BBP contains the cystatin-like domain of SPP-24. BBP is expressed at least in the liver and bone (including at least demineralized cortical bone and periosteum).</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The BBP amino acid sequence is similar to the TGF-Î²/BMP-binding region of fetuin, a member of the cystatin family of protease inhibitors. BBP avidly binds rhBMP-2 (recombinant human BMP-2) with a K<sub>D</sub> of x 10<sup>-5</sup> M. BBP may also bind other molecules having similar binding domains to BMP-2, such as other TGF-Î² proteins (including but not limited to BMP-4 and BMP-7) and affect their retention rates and/or activity as well.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">BBP alone induces calcification of vertebrate chondrogenic and osteogenic precursor cells. BBP increases the increases the rate and degree to which rhBMP-2 induces bone formation. Surprisingly, BBP as used with BMP-2 <i>in vivo</i> causes osteogenesis to occur faster and to a greater extent and with smaller amounts of rhBMP-2.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">For example, when implanted alone in mouse muscle, the BBP induces dystrophic calcification. The process of bone formation in repair or ectopic bone formation the "mouse hindquarter" or "muscle pouch" model recapitulates endochondral bone formation. The first step involves the production of cartilage, which is replaced by bone. This same process that occurs during endochondral bone formation in development, while some membraneous bone formation occurs directly without a cartilage intermediary.</p>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">In one embodiment of the invention, a peptide comprising a fragment of BBP may be useful, if the fragment similarly increases degree or rate of osteogenesis by BMP-2 in mammalian cells, or increases degree or rate of calcification in vertebrate cells, or specifically mammalian chondrogenic or osteogenic progenitor cells.</p>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Forms of BBP having modifications of the amino acid SEQ. ID No. 1 may also be useful in this invention. For example, the conserved amino acid sequences of BBP between species, deletional or insertional modifications, conservative or semi-conservative substitutional modifications are intended to be encompassed in the claimed BBP, to the extent that the modified amino acid sequences increase the residency time and or activity of BMP-2 or other TGF-Î² homologous molecules. BBP is a Î²-pleated sheet-turn-beat pleated sheet molecular motif ("B-T-B"). It is currently believed that growth factor binding amino acids reside in the T-section. Therefore, amino acid substitutions in the T-section may affect activity of BBP to a greater extent than substitutions in the B regions.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">One embodiment of the invention comprises a peptide having the sequence of SEQ ID No. 11: C-R-S-T-V-X-Y-S-X-X-X-V-X-X-V X-Y-Y-C, which is the mammalian consensus sequence for BBP. <figref>Figure 14A</figref> shows the homology in amino acid sequence across bovine (SEQ ID No. 1; nucleic acid sequence set forth at SEQ ID No. 2), human (SEQ ID No. 13; nucleic acid sequence set forth at SEQ ID No. 14 (position 9 is either A or V), porcine (SEQ ID No. 15; nucleic acid sequence set forth at SEQ ID No. 16), ovine (SEQ ID No. 17; nucleic acid sequence set forth at SEQ ID No. 18), rat (SEQ ID No. 19; nucleic acid sequence set forth at SEQ ID No. 20), and mouse (SEQ ID No. 21; nucleic acid sequence set forth at SEQ ID No. 22) BBP. <figref>Figure 14A</figref> also shows highly conserved regions in chicken (SEQ ID No. 23; nucleic acid sequence set forth at SEQ ID No. 24), salmon (SEQ ID No. 25; nucleic acid sequence set forth at SEQ ID No. 26) and trout (SEQ ID No. 27; nucleic acid sequence set forth at SEQ ID No. 28).</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In <figref>Fig. 14 A</figref>, "X" and "Y" are used to denote amino acid substitutions that are understood to be semi-conservative or conservative, respectively. Conservative substitutions include amino acids selected from the same group, and semi-conservative substitutions include substitutions that are not believed to affect the BMP-2 binding domain or the function of the BBP. For example, the substitution at position 6 is conservative between human, rat and ovine, but semi-conservative with some other species because the amino acids reported at that position in different species are: Q and E (Q in porcine, rat, and mouse BBP, and E in chicken). Although K and R are both classified as basic amino acids, Q is classified as an uncharged polar amino acid, therefore the substitution is not conservative. The substitution is semi-conservative, however, because the function of BBP is believed to be unaffected. Semi-conservative substitutions are also found at positions 9, 10, 11, and 16. At position 9, the amino acids A is found in bovine, human, porcine and ovine BBP, compared to K in rat and mouse BBP. At position 10, the amino acid E is reported for bovine, porcine, and ovine BBP, human BBP contains Q at that position, and rat and mouse BBP contain the amino acid G. At position 11, the amino acid Q is found in bovine, human, rat and mouse, whereas K, is reported for porcine BBP and R for ovine BBP. At position 16, W is found in bovine, porcine, ovine, rat and mouse BBP, whereas human BBP contains an H. There are also semi-conservative substitutions at positions 13 and 14 between rat/human, as opposed to other species.</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">An example of a conservative substation is found at position 7. At this position, different hydrophobic amino acids are observed in different species, namely, M in bovine, ovine, rat, and mouse BBP, compared to V in human and I in porcine BBP. This substitution is considered conservative because M, V, and I are all hydrophobic amino acids. Other conservative substitutions occur at positions 17 and 18. Two hydrophobic amino acids, A and V, are found at position 17. At position 18, two basic amino acids, R and H, are found.</p>

      <b>Applications for BBP.</b> A number of applications for BBP are suggested from its pharmacological (biological activity) properties. For example, BBP alone or in combination with other TGF-family members such as BMP-2, BMP-4 and BMP-7, or demineralized bone matrix may be used in clinical or research methods for inducing bone formation, maintaining bone homeostasis and/or enhancing bone repair. BBP may be used alone or in combination to treat developmental or homeostatic bone disorders (such as osteoporosis), bone injury (such as fracture healing flat (e.g., membranous) and long (e.g., endochondral) bones [comment that this is equally applicable], non-union fractures and reconstructive surgery. The invention may also be used in treating periodontitis, periodontal regeneration, alveolar ridge augmentation for tooth implant reconstruction, treatment of non-union fractures, sites of knee/hip/joint repair or replacement surgery.</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Clinical indices of a method or compounds ability to maintain bone homeostasis is evidenced by improvements in bone density at different sites through out the body as assessed, at least by DEXA scanning. Enhanced bone formation in a healing fracture is routinely assessed by regular X-ray of the fracture site at selected time intervals. More advanced techniques for determining the above indices, such as quantitative CT scanning or quantitative histological methods (eg., tissue is processed, stained, and microscopically examined and bone defined an measured with image analysis) may be used. Further, measures of bone density, bone area, bone mineral content, formation of ectopic bone, and increases in the opacity of tissue upon X-ray examination, expression of alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium incorporation, mineralization or expression of osteocalcin mRNA may be used to observe the effects of BBP calcification and/or osteogenesis</p>

Agents which may be useful in this invention to effect osteoclastic bone resorption include, but are not limited to, bisphosphonates, the selective estrogen receptor modulators, calcitonin, and vitamin D/calcium supplementation. The invention may also include the use of agents which induce osteoblastic bone formation.

Specifically, it has been demonstrated that the osteogenic effects of BBP in an animal model using rat femur, ectopic bone formation model. Therefore it is anticipated that, based on these similar findings, BBP will have osteogenic effects <i>in vivo</i> in humans.

      <b>Example 2: <i>IN VIVO</i> ACTIVITY OF BBP</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">
      <b>Methods:</b> The osteogenic activity of material was tested using male Swiss-Weber mice aged 8 to 10 weeks were used (Taconic Farms Germantown, NY). Prior to the assay, the BBP was solublized and lyophilized into 2 mg of atelocollagen. The dried material was placed in a #5 gelatin capsule and sterilized by exposure to chloroform vapor. To conduct the assay, mice were anesthetized using 1 % isoflurane delivered in oxygen at 2 l/min through a small animal anesthesia machine (VetEquip, Pleasanton, CA). Animals were affixed to a surgery board and the fur over the hindquarters shaved. The skin was cleaned with 70% ethanol and a midline incision made over the spine adjacent to the hindquarters. Blunt dissection with scissors was used to expose the quadriceps muscle on one side. A small pouch was made in the muscle using the point of scissors and the #5 capsule containing the test material was inserted into the pouch. The skin was then closed with three 11 mm Michel surgical clips and the animal returned to its cage for monitoring.</p>
    <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">After 21 days the animals were killed and the hindquarter removed. Radiological examination of the specimens was accomplished using a small parts X-Ray cabinet (Faxitron, Wheeling, IL). For quantization of bone formation, bone area and the bone mineral content (BMC) of an area of interest encompassing the site of ectopic bone formation was determined using a PIXImus2 small animal densitometer (GE Lunar, Madison, WI). Specimens were then placed in buffered formalin and submitted for routine processing for histological examination.</p>
    <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">Various amounts of rhBMP-2 and BBP were combined and prepared for implantation. All possible combinations of the following amounts were used in pilot studies, rhBMP-2: 0 Âµg, 0.05 Âµg, 0.5 Âµg, 5 Âµg, and 50 Âµg; BBP: 0 Âµg, 50 Âµg, and Âµg 500 mg. Samples of 5 Âµg of rhBMP-2 were used in more extensive subsequent studies because that amount consistently produced an amount of ectopic bone that was neither too large nor too small for reliable analysis.</p>

      <b>Example 3: SURFACE PLASMON RESONANCE TO DETERMINE THE INTERACTION OF BMP-2 AND THE SYNTHETIC PEPTIDE</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">
      <b>Methods:</b> The binding interaction between rhBMP-2 and BBP was characterized using surface plasmon resonance employing a Biacom X instrument (Biacore, Piscataway, NJ). Buffers and chips for the procedure were obtained from Biacore. RhBMP-2 was dialyzed into 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5 at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. This material was then attached to a CM-5 sensor chip using reagents and procedures supplied by the manufacturer. Running buffer was 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P20. The peptide was dissolved in running buffer at concentrations ranging from 1 x 10<sup>-5</sup> to 1 x 10<sup>-4</sup> M. Flow rates from 5 to 50 Âµl/min and injection volumes of 20 to 100 Âµl were employed. The regeneration solution was 10 ÂµM glycine-HCl, pH 2.0.</p>
    <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">
      <b>Results:</b> Results of the surface plasmon resonance studies to determine the interaction between rhBMP-2 and BBP are shown in <figref>FIG 9</figref>.</p>

      <b>Methods:</b> Labeled rhBMP-2 was mixed with BBP or vehicle and applied to collagen sponges. The sponges were implanted into muscle pouches in rodents. At specified times (1, 3 and 7 days), the implants were removed and the amount of BMP remaining determined. Four animals were used in each group.</p>
    <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">
      <b>Results:</b> BBP increased retention of rhBMP-2 by a factor of about two. <figref>FIG. 10</figref> is a bar graph depicting the percentage of rhBMP-2 retention over 1, 3 and 7 days in the presence or absence of BBP.</p>
