    </heading>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The storage, transportation, and consumption of food products is an ongoing challenge in day-to-day life. A variety of food items such as soups, salads, sandwiches, pastas, stews, breads, cheeses, and other foods often have conflicting storage requirements. For example, soups and pastas may require special containers to stay warm, while salads and cheeses may require different containers to stay cool. Multiple separate containers may occupy a considerable amount of space during storage and transportation. In addition, these multiple containers and or the associated lids may become separated or lost during transport. Further, additional containers or serving plates may be required to consume the food items, since many food storage containers are not typically designed for consumption of the food items.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">A need exists for a multi-chamber food storage device capable of storing food items with different storage requirements in a compact and easily transported configuration. In addition, a need exists for a multi-chamber food storage device in which the multiple chambers are attached to prevent the loss of individual containers. A need further exists for a multi-chamber food storage device capable of serving the food items in a stable and aesthetically pleasing manner.</p>

    <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In another aspect, the first lid 702 and/or second lid 704 may be unvented. Referring to <figref>FIG. 19A</figref>, the inner surface 1902 of the lid 702/704 may form a continuous surface extending across the entire extent of the opening 806/808 of the container 102/108. In an additional aspect, the first lid 702 and/or second lid 704 may be vented to equalize an internal pressure of the volume 802/804 within the container 102/108 with the ambient pressure outside of the container 102/108.</p>

In this additional aspect, the vent 1904 may form a valved passage from the outer lid surface 1802 (not shown) to the inner lid surface 1902. In one aspect, the vent 1904 may open to permit airflow into the volume 802/804 when the internal pressure within the volume 802/804 falls sufficiently below the ambient pressure. Ambient pressure, as used herein, refers to the atmospheric pressure typically present outside of the first container 102 and the second container 108. Without being limited to any particular theory, this equalization of internal pressure may reduce the amount of force need to remove the lid 702/704 from the opening 806/808 due to the reduction of any suction formed within the container 102/108.</p>
    <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Suction may form within the container 102/108 as a result of any one or more of a variety of mechanisms. In one aspect, the cooling of a heated food item stored within the sealed container 102/108 including, but not limited to, a soup or tea may decrease the vapor pressure of the heated food, thereby inducing a reduction in internal pressure within the container 102/108. In another aspect, the removal of the lid 702/704 prior to breaking the seal between the edge seal 906/910 lid and the openings 806/808 may increase the sealed inner volume 802/804 resulting in an internal pressure drop within the sealed container 102/108 that may create a suction.</p>
