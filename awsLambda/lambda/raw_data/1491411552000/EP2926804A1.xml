    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a cosmetic preparation capable of preventing a feel and stability thereof from being impaired due to low molecular cyclosiloxanes. The present invention also relates to a hair cosmetic preparation capable of preventing a stability, feel and foaming property thereof from being impaired.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Silicone oils are widely used in cosmetic preparations, since they are colorless, odorless and chemically and physiologically inactive. Particularly, high-viscosity organopolysiloxanes are often used in hair cosmetic preparations, since they are capable of adhering to the hair in a favorable manner.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">However, when directly emulsifying a high-viscosity organopolysiloxane, the average particle diameter of the emulsion particles can only be as small as about several micrometers, and a finer average particle diameter cannot be easily obtained, thus resulting in a low emulsion stability.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">For this reason, various studies have been made on a method for producing an emulsion through emulsion polymerization, for the purpose of obtaining fine emulsion particles and thus improving the stability of the emulsion. For example, there has been known a method for performing emulsion polymerization on an emulsified cyclic siloxane oligomer, using a strong acid or a strong base (Patent documents 1, 2 and 3). However, in each method, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane will be produced in an emulsion in an amount of not smaller than 1,000 ppm by mass. Thus, when adding such emulsion to a cosmetic preparation, there occurs a problem that the stability and feel will be impaired.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Further, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane has been considered as a substance of concern in recent years, and cosmetic preparations containing a restricted amount of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane have been demanded.</p>

    <heading id="h-00006-en">Problem to be solved by the invention</heading>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a cosmetic preparation whose stability and feel are not impaired due to low molecular cyclosiloxanes; and a hair cosmetic preparation whose stability, feel and foaming property are not impaired.</p>
    <heading id="h-00007-en">Means to solve the problem</heading>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In view of the aforementioned facts, the inventors of the present invention have dedicated themselves to carrying out further studies.

    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In the general formula (1), R<sup>1</sup> represents a hydrogen atom or a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Unsubstituted hydrocarbon groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms include, for example, an alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms; a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 20 carbon atoms; an alkenyl group having 2 to 20 carbon atoms; an aryl group having 6 to 20 carbon atoms; and an aralkyl group having 7 to 20 carbon atoms. Specifically, such unsubstituted hydrocarbon groups include an alkyl group such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, a butyl group, a pentyl group, a hexyl group, a heptyl group, an octyl group, a nonyl group, a decyl group, a dodecyl group, a tetradecyl group, a hexadecyl group or an octadecyl group; a cycloalkyl group such as a cyclopentyl group or a cyclohexyl group; an alkenyl group such as vinyl or allyl; and an aryl group such as a phenyl group, a tolyl group or a naphthyl group.

    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In the general formula (1), n represents a value allowing the kinetic viscosity of the organopolysiloxane to become 3,000 to 100,000 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at 25Â°C. When such viscosity is lower than 3,000 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, emulsion polymerization needs to be performed for a longer period of time to endow the organopolysiloxane contained in the target emulsion with a desired viscosity, thereby causing more octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane to be produced as a byproduct during emulsion polymerization, thus negatively affecting the stability, feel and foaming property when added to a cosmetic preparation. Meanwhile, when such viscosity is exceedingly high, the target emulsion obtained shall exhibit an unfavorable stability, thus also resulting in an unfavorable stability when added to a cosmetic preparation. It is preferred that such viscosity be 3,000 to 50,000 mm<sup>2</sup>/s. It is particularly preferred that such viscosity be 4,000 to 20,000 mm<sup>2</sup>/s.</p>

Here, if water is added in an amount greater than 10 parts by mass, it will be difficult to obtain a fine emulsion composition whose emulsion particles have an average particle diameter of not larger than 300 nm, thus decreasing the stability of the emulsion. Meanwhile, if water is added in an amount of smaller than 1 part by mass, it will be difficult to produce an O/W emulsion. It is preferred that water be added in an amount of 2 to 8 parts by mass to 100 parts by mass of (A). Further, it is particularly preferred that water is added in an amount of 4 to 6 parts by mass to 100 parts by mass of (A).</p>

However, the component (E) needs not to be used, if the component (C) is capable of acting as an acid catalyst.</p>
    <heading id="h-00017-en">-Step (I)-</heading>
    <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The first emulsion composition is obtained by emulsifying the components (A), (B), (C) and (D-1). Particularly, emulsification may be performed using an emulsifier such as a homodisper, a homomixer, a colloid mill, a line mixer, a versatile mixer, an ultra mixer, a planetary mixer and a Combi Mix Â®.</p>
    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In this step, if the component (C) used is capable of acting as an acid catalyst or if the component (E) is added, condensation also takes place at the same time, thus requiring that emulsification be performed at a temperature lower than 40Â°C. When emulsification is performed at 40Â°C or higher, a large amount of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane may be produced. Therefore, it is preferred that emulsification be performed at a temperature lower than 15Â°C; and it is particularly preferred that emulsification be performed at a temperature lower than 5Â°C.</p>
    <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In step (I), the components (A), (B), (C) and (D-1) are mixed well until the average particle diameter of the emulsion particles of the first emulsion composition has reached 300 nm or smaller, preferably 200 nm or smaller, particularly preferably 150 nm or smaller. The smaller the particle diameter of the first emulsion particles, the higher the polymerization rate becomes in step (II), thus leading to a shorter polymerization time. Further, since the average particle diameter of the emulsion particles of the first emulsion composition is 300 nm or smaller, the average particle diameter of the final emulsion particles obtained in the following step will also become 300 nm or smaller. It is preferred that the average particle diameter eventually be 200 nm or smaller, and it is particularly preferred that the average particle diameter eventually be 150 nm or smaller.</p>
    <heading id="h-00018-en">&lt; Step (II) &gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">At the beginning of this step, water (D-2) is added in an amount of 0 to 100,000 parts by mass to 100 parts by mass of the component (A), followed by performing emulsion polymerization. That is, water is optionally added before performing emulsion polymerization, and may actually not be added. If added, water is added in an amount of not larger than 100,000 parts by mass. It is preferred that water be added in an amount of 0 to 1,000 parts by mass, and it is particularly preferred that water be added in an amount of 0 to 200 parts by mass.</p>
    <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In this way, in the case where water (D-2) is added to the first emulsion composition, emulsification equipment such as a high-pressure homogenizer can also be used later to further perform emulsification and dispersion.</p>
    <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Next, such emulsion composition is subjected to emulsion polymerization. It is preferred that this polymerization step be carried out at a temperature of lower than 40Â°C and within 48 hours. If the polymerization step is carried out at 40Â°C or higher, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane may be produced in a large amount. Therefore, it is preferred that the polymerization step be performed at a temperature of lower than 15Â°C, more preferably at a temperature of not higher than 5Â°C, and particularly preferably at a temperature of -15Â°C to 5Â°C. Further, a polymerization time longer than 48 hours may cause octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane to be produced in a large amount. For this reason, it is preferred that the polymerization time be within 1 to 30 hours, particularly 5 to 24 hours.</p>
    <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">At that time, the absolute viscosity of the organopolysiloxane produced through emulsion polymerization is 300,000 to 20,000,000 mPaÂ·s; and the amount of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane contained in the emulsion is not more than 1,000 ppm by mass.</p>
    <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">By performing emulsion polymerization in the presence of (E) acid catalyst, polymerization is facilitated such that the polymerization time can be shortened. While it is not required to add (E) acid catalyst to the polymerization system other than (C) anion surfactant if (C) itself is capable of acting as an acid catalyst, (E) acid catalyst may nevertheless be added.</p>
    <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">According to the method for producing the emulsion composition of the present invention, the polymerization time is within 15 hours, normally within a range of 5 to 15 hours; and the absolute viscosity (25Â°C) of the organopolysiloxane produced reaches 300,000 mPaÂ·s or higher. It is preferred that, within 15 hours, such absolute viscosity reach 500,000 mPaÂ·s or higher, more preferably 1,000,000 mPaÂ·s, and particularly preferably 5,000,000 mPaÂ·s or higher.</p>
    <heading id="h-00019-en">&lt; Other treatment &gt;</heading>

    <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">At that time, not only water can be added to adjust the silicone concentration, but a preservative agent and/or an antifungal agent, for example, may also be added to improve the preserving property of the emulsion composition.</p>

    <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In the present invention, when D4 (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane) occupies a total amount of D3 (hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane) to D10 (eicosamethylcyclodecasiloxane) by a ratio of not smaller than 60% by mass, the feel and stability are improved in the case of a cosmetic preparation; and the feel, stability as well as foaming property are improved in the case of a hair cosmetic preparation. The reason for that is because, as compared to D4, D5 (decamethylcyclopentasiloxane) to D10 more negatively affect the feel and stability of a cosmetic preparation; and the feel, stability as well as foaming property of a hair cosmetic preparation. It is preferred that D4 occupy the total amount of D3 to D10 by a ratio of not smaller than 70% by mass. For the same reason, each of D5 to D10 occupies the total amount of D3 to D10 by a ratio of not larger than 30% by mass, preferably not larger than 20% by mass.</p>
    <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Moreover, when the amount of D4 contained in (a) is larger than 1,000 ppm by mass, there will be a significant impact on the environment. And, when the amount of low molecular cyclosiloxanes other than D4 contained in (a) are large, the feel and stability of a cosmetic preparation will be significantly impaired. In the case of a hair cosmetic preparation, the feel, stability as well as foaming property will be impaired.</p>

Therefore, it is preferred that the amount of such low molecular cyclosiloxane be not larger than 50 ppm by mass as for D3; not larger than 200 ppm by mass as for D5; not larger than 150 ppm by mass as for D6; and not larger than 50 ppm by mass as for each of D7 to D10. Further, it is particularly preferred that the amount of such low molecular cyclosiloxane be not larger than 30 ppm by mass as for D3; not larger than 150 ppm by mass as for D5; not larger than 100 ppm by mass as for D6; and not larger than 20 ppm by mass as for each of D7 to D10.</p>
    <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">In addition, while the amounts of such low molecular cyclosiloxanes of each of D3 to D10 are as those described above, it is preferred that a total amount thereof be not larger than 1,000 ppm. This is because the total amount greater than 1,000 ppm will impair the feel and stability of a cosmetic preparation.</p>
