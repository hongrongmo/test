    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">A dishwasher is an electric appliance that injects high pressure washing water from washing arm and washes garbage attached to the dishes by the washing water.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The dishwasher generally includes a tub for forming a washing chamber, and a sump, mounted at a bottom side of the tub, for storing the washing water.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">A washing pump mounted inside the sump pumps the washing water into the washing arm, and the pumped washing water is injected in high pressure from a nozzle of the washing arm.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In addition, the injected washing water washes the garbage attached to the dishes to fall it on the floor of the tub.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The used washing water is separated from the garbage and then is collected into the sump to discharge it outside.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In order to enhance the rinsing capability for the dishes in prior art, much washing water is supplied or much hot water is supplied.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">However, there was a problem that increases the water amount to be used on increasing the washing water amount.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Further, there was a problem that increases use of electricity and therefore lowers energy efficiency on using hot water.</p>

    <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">A method for controlling the dishwasher in the embodiment of the present invention includes supplying the washing water to the sump 10 (S210) after ending the cleaning (S120).</p>
    <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The washing water amount collected into the sump 10 during the supplying (S210) may be formed less than the water amount required to inject the washing water from the washing arm 30 during the rinsing for the sump (S220).</p>
    <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The raw water supply section 25 may be the source of waterworks. The raw water supply section 25 supplies city water, and the washing water may be the city water. The feed water valve 23 blocks the washing water supplied from the raw water supply section 25.</p>
    <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">The feed water valve 23 may be a solenoid valve.</p>
    <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">A flowmeter 71 measures the flow of the washing water. The flowmeter 71, connected to the raw water supply section 25, measures the flow of the washing water supplied from the outside. The controller 50 receives information from the flowmeter 71 to determine the closing time of the feed water valve 23.</p>
    <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">In order to efficiently inject the washing water into the dishes, the dish rack 40 is formed in a grill type. The dish rack 40 may include a roller (not shown) allowing it to back and forth move inside the tub 5. The tub 5 may include a rail for guiding the roller.</p>
    <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The washing arm 30 injects the washing water fed by the washing pump 17 into the inside of the tub 5. The washing arm 30 may be rotated inside the tub 5. A plurality of the washing arms 30 may be disposed according to heights.</p>
    <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">Preferably, the washing arm 30 includes a lower arm 33, disposed at a bottom of the lower rack 43, for injecting the washing water into the lower rack 43, an upper arm 32 disposed between the lower rack 43 and the upper rack 42, and a top arm 31 disposed at a top of the top rack 41.</p>
    <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">A flow path switching motor 77 may change the flow paths of the washing water discharged from the washing pump 17.</p>
    <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The flow path switching motor 77 in the present embodiment may supply the washing water to any one of the lower arm 33, the upper arm 32, and the top arm 31.</p>
    <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The flow path switching motor 77 may be a step motor. The controller 50 changes the flow paths of the washing water by the flow path switching motor 77.</p>
    <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The memory 75 consists of a volatile memory losing the stored information on cutting off the power and a nonvolatile memory keeping the stored information on cutting off the power.</p>
    <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The memory 75 includes a ROM (Read Only Memory) and a RAM (Random Access Memory). The memory 75 may be preferably the ROM keeping information on cutting off the power.</p>
    <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">The memory 75 is stored with information for feed water amount per each cycle, revolutions per minute of the washing motor 19, and the driving time of the washing motor 19.</p>
    <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">The controller 50, connected to the memory 75, stores the collected information or drives the set programs. The controller 50 controls the washing motor 19 and the feed water valve 23 based on the information stored into the memory 75.</p>
    <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">The controller 50 opens the feed water valve 23 and performs the supplying (S210). The washing water is flown from the raw water supply section 25 to the sump 10 on opening the feed water valve 23. The controller 50 receives information from a timer 73 or the flowmeter 71 to control the water amount.</p>
    <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">For example, when the feed water amount is set to 0.5L, the washing water is not injected from the washing arm 30 to the tub 5 because the washing water does not reach a nozzle formed at the washing arm 30. Therefore, in this case, since the washing water rinsing the sump 10 is not injected, it is possible to prevent the re-contamination of the dishes caused due to the foreign substances at the sump.</p>
    <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">That is, the amount at which the washing water is not injected is supplied to the sump 10 in the present embodiment and it is possible to rinse or clean the foreign substances collected into the sump.</p>
    <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">The feed water amount (0.5L) of the washing water may be variously set by volume of the flow path, etc.</p>
    <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">A method for controlling the dishwasher in the embodiment of the present invention includes supplying the washing water to the sump 10 (S210) after ending the washing (S120).</p>
    <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">The water amount of the washing water collected into the sump 10 during the supplying (S210) may be formed less than the water amount required to flow backward the washing water from the sump 10 to the tub 5 (S227) during the rinsing for the sump (S220).</p>
    <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">The sump 10 disposed at the bottom of the tub 5 receives the washing water. The sump 10 includes a filter net 13 for filtering the foreign substances contained at the washing water, a filter receptor 15 for receiving the filter net 13, and a washing pump 17 for suctioning the washing water collected into the filter receptor 15 and feeding the suctioned washing water into the washing arm 30.</p>
    <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">The sump 10 includes a sump cover for covering the top side thereof and guiding falling washing water into the filter 11.</p>
    <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">The filter net is formed in a mesh type. The plurality of the filter net 13 having sizes different from each other may be formed. For example, the filter net 13 disposed at the top thereof filters out the foreign substances only having large size because the number of the meshes per unit area is small. The filter net 13 disposed at the bottom thereof filters out the foreign substances having small size because the number of the meshes per unit area is large.</p>
    <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">The filter receptor 15 receives the filter net 13. The filter 13 is formed as a depth capable of adequately collecting the foreign substances. The filter receptor 15 is formed as a depth capable of receiving the filter net 13. The filter receptor 15 is connected to the washing pump 17.</p>
    <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">The washing pump 17 suctions and discharges the washing water received at the filter receptor 15. The washing pump 17 discharges the washing water into the washing arm 30. The controller 50 receives information from a timer 73 or the flowmeter 71 to control the water amount.</p>
    <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">For example, when the feed water amount is set to 0.5L, the washing water flowing from the filter receptor 15 to the tub 5 is not flown backward because the washing water amount is lack. Therefore, the washing water rinsing the sump 10 does not contaminate the dishes laid at the tub 5.</p>
    <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">Further, on ending the driving of the washing pump 17, the washing water increased up to a constant height of the washing arm 30 passes the washing pump 17 and may be flown backward into the filter receptor 15. That is, when the feed water amount of the washing water is much, it may be flown backward from the filter receptor 15 to the tub 5 via the filter net 13.</p>
    <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">The feed water amount in the present embodiment is set to the amount that is not flown backward from the filter 11 to the tub 5.</p>
    <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">When the feed water amount (0.5L) of the washing water may be differed according to the size of the dishwasher and the volume of the flow path.</p>
    <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">A rotational speed of the washing motor 19 may be the rotational speed, at the rinsing for the sump (S220) according to the embodiment of the present invention, until the washing water is injected from the washing arm 30.</p>
    <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">Generally, lifts are increased on increasing the number of rotation for the washing motor 19. When the lifts of the washing pump 17 are increased, the washing water may be injected into the tub 5 through the washing arm 30. The rotational speed of the washing motor 19 is set to 600RPM in the present embodiment, but the number of rotation may be differed according to the height of the washing arm and the volume of the flow path.</p>
    <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">In addition, the rotational speed of the washing motor 19 may be the speed, at the rinsing for the sump (S220), at which the washing water is not flown backward from the sump 10 to the tub 5.</p>
    <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">That is, the rotational speed is set to the speed at which the washing water of the sump 10 is not flown backward into the tub 5 through the filter 11.</p>

Therefore, the cleanliness of the dishes may be enhanced although the sum of the performance time of the rinsing for the dishes performed by the cold water (S320) and the performance time of the rinsing for the dishes performed by the hot water (S520) is reduced.</p>
    <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">The method for controlling the dishwasher in the embodiment of the present invention includes dumping the washing water received at the sump 10 by driving the drainage motor 21 (S230) after ending the rinsing for the sump (S220).</p>
    <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">The controller 50 drives the drainage motor 21 to discharge the washing water.
