    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">Provided are: a method and a kit for producing a biological specimen clear, which enable the clearing within a short time and by which a wide variety of biological specimens can be cleared; and a method and a kit for preserving a cleared biological specimen. A method for producing a cleared biological specimen, comprising steps as mentioned in items (A) to (C). (A) Step (1) of treating a material to be cleared with a fixing solution that is an aqueous solution containing paraformaldehyde or the like, a nonionic surfactant (at a concentration of 1% or more) and an alkali and optionally containing a buffering agent to produce the material that is cleared is involved. (B) Step (2) of treating the material that is produced in step (1) or a material to be cleared which is produced by a conventional fixing method with a clearing accelerator solution that is an aqueous solution containing a nonionic surfactant (at a concentration of 1% or more) and an alkali to produce the material that is cleared is involved. (C) Step (3) of treating the material produced in step (1) or (2) with a preservation solution that is an aqueous solution containing a nonionic surfactant (at a concentration of 1% or more) and a polyhydric alcohol to produce the material that is cleared is involved. A kit which can be used in the method.<img id="imga-00001-en" wi="79" he="41" img-content="drawing" file="imgaf001.tif" img-format="tif" /></p>

      <b>Problem to Be Solved by the Invention</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Conventional methods of making biological specimens clear mainly present the following problems: <ol><li>(1) The tissue tends to be damaged in tissue digestion with protein-degrading enzymes or alkali solutions.</li><li>(2) Long periods (several days to several months) are required for separate staining with mixed solutions of alkali and glycerol.</li><li>(3) Long periods (several days to several months) are required for clearing by glycerol or Scale reagent. Great difficulty is also present in making specific organs clear, such as the brain, liver, and placenta.</li><li>(4) Benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate mixed solutions are organic solvents, treatment with these mixed solutions weakens the fluorescence signal (Patent Reference 3), and the scope of application, including observation following clearing, is limited.</li></ol></p>

      <b>Modes of Carrying Out the Invention</b>
    </heading>
    <heading id="h-00010-en">&lt; Method (A) for producing cleared biological specimens &gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The method (A) for producing cleared biological specimens of the present invention comprises at least step (1) below.</p>
    <heading id="h-00011-en">Step (1) of treating with a fixing liquid a biological specimen in the form of a material being cleared</heading>
    <heading id="h-00012-en">Step (1)</heading>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The fixing liquid employed in step (1) is (a) an aqueous solution comprising formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde, a nonionic surfactant, an alkali, and a buffer or (b) an aqueous solution comprising formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde, an nonionic surfactant, and an alkali. The treatment with the fixing liquid is one that produces moderate digestion and a marked clearing effect while simultaneously fixing tissue, primarily in a material being cleared.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde is a component that fixes the tissue. Formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde can be employed singly, or can be mixed for use. The concentration of the formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde in the aqueous solution is suitably determined from the perspective of permitting suitable tissue fixation. For example, it can fall within a range of 1 to 10 w/v%, desirably falling within a range of 2 to 7 w/v%. However, these ranges are not intended as limitations.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The nonionic surfactant is a component that makes the biological specimen clear. Any surfactant that is nonionic can be employed without restriction. Examples are esters, ethers, ester-ethers, and other forms of nonionic surfactants. Nonionic surfactants in the form of ethers are desirable. Examples of ether nonionic surfactants are Triton X-100 (octylphenolpoly(ethyleneglycolether)<sub>n</sub>, where n denotes about 10, HLB 13.4 to 13.5) and Tween 20 (polysorbate 20, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate, HLB 16.7). Tween 20 is a type of polysorbate. This polysorbate has about 20 molecules of ethylene oxide condensed into a sorbitan fatty acid ester. Examples in addition to Tween 20 are Tween 40 (polysorbate 40, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate, HLB 15.6), Tween 60 (polysorbate 60, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate, HLB 14.9), Tween 65 (polysorbate 65, polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate, HLB 10.5), and Tween 80 (polysorbate 80, polyoxyethylene sorbitan oleate, HLB 15.0).</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The nonionic surfactant is a component that makes the biological specimen clear, as set forth above. To make the biological specimen clear, the concentration of the nonionic surfactant in the fixing liquid, for example, falls within a range of 1 to 40 v/v%. The concentration can be suitably selected based on the type of nonionic surfactant and the type of material being cleared. The concentration of the nonionic surfactant in the clearing-promoting liquid desirably falls within a range of 2 to 30 v/v%, preferably within a range of 5 to 25 v/v%. However, these ranges are not intended as limitations. Tween 20 has generally been found to exhibit a clearing effect at lower concentrations that Triton X-100. However, Tween 20 imparts a yellow coloration and there are times when its use at high concentration (5% or higher) is difficult. In bright fields, with the naked eye, and under a microscope, there are cases where a concentration falling within a range of 1 to 5 v/v% is desirable. Triton X100 is desirably incorporated at relatively high concentration and Tween 20 at relatively low concentration. However, when Triton X100 exceeds 30%, the consistency increases sharply. The practical upper concentration limit is 25 v/v%.</p>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023"> As shown in Reference Example 1, as compared to Triton X-100 with an HLB of 13.4 to 13.5, Tween 20 with an HLB of 16.7 exhibits a clearing effect even at low concentration. Thus, there tend to be differences in the clearing effects based on the HLB of the nonionic surfactant. Further, as shown in Reference Example 1, a better clearing effect is achieved when Tween 20 and Triton X-100 are employed in combination as compared to when employed singly. Although the reason for this is unclear, the type and concentration of the nonionic surfactant in the fixing liquid can be suitably selected within ranges that are suited to clearing taking these points into account.</p>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The alkali is a component for biological (protein) digestion and can be a hydroxide of an alkali metal element (such as Li, Na, or K). Specifically, it can be KOH or NaOH. The concentration of the alkali can be suitably determined by taking into account the degree of biological (protein) digestion. For example, it can fall within a range of 0.1 to 10 w/v%, desirably within a range of 0.5 to 2 w/v%.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Fixing liquid (a) contains a buffer in addition to formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde, a nonionic surfactant, and an alkali. Fixing liquid (b) contains formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde, a nonionic surfactant, and an alkali, but not a buffer. The buffer is a component for adjusting the pH of the fixing liquid to within a prescribed range (such as 5 to 12, desirably 7 to 11). The presence of a buffer (for example, pH 5 to 8) further inhibits damage to the tissue by alkali digestion. However, even in fixing liquid (b) which does not contain a buffer, incorporating the above components enables to fix the material being cleared. However, when employing fixing liquid (a) not containing a buffer, it is possible to inhibit damage to tissue by the alkali digestion. A single buffer can be incorporated so long as it is a material having a pH-buffering effect. Examples are phosphate buffers (such as phosphoric acid, sodium monohydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, potassium monohydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, employed singly or in mixtures) and boric acid - borax buffers. There is no intension to limit to phosphate buffers, but phosphate buffers are desirable.</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Specifically, fixing liquid (a) can be a mixed aqueous solution of, for example, 2 to 4% formaldehyde phosphate buffer or 2 to 4% paraformaldehyde phosphate buffer, alkali solution (1% KOH or NaOH), and nonionic surfactant (5% Triton X-100 or Tween 20). Specifically, fixing liquid (b) can be a mixed aqueous solution of, for example, 2-4% formaldehyde aqueous solution or 2 to 4% paraformaldehyde aqueous solution, alkali solution (1 % KOH or NaOH), and nonionic surfactant (5% Triton X-100 or Tween 20).</p>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">However, the concentrations of the various components are not intended to be limited to the above values. The above are merely examples.</p>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The treatment of the material being cleared with the fixing liquid can be conducted, for example, by immersing the material being cleared in a prescribed quantity (a quantity at least sufficient to fully immerse the material being cleared in the fixing liquid) of fixing liquid at room temperature (for example, at 5 to 35°C, desirably 15 to 30°C, identical below) or at a temperature within a range of 60°C from room temperature, for a period falling within a range of 1 to 48 hours, desirably within range of 1 to 24 hours, and preferably within a range of 2 to 12 hours. The higher the temperature, the more quickly fixation tends to be completed. However, depending on the type of material being cleared, there may be a risk of greatly damaging the tissue. Thus, the treatment temperature is desirably suitably adjusted taking this point into account. However, the above temperatures and times are merely examples, and no limitation to these ranges is intended. When employing fixing liquid (b), which does not contain a buffer, from the perspective of inhibiting damage to the tissue by alkali digestion, the treatment is desirably conducted at a relatively low temperature, such as at room temperature.</p>
    <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The treatment of the above material being cleared with the fixing liquid can be conducted with irradiation by microwaves during part or all of the treatment operation. The frequency of the microwaves can be, for example, 2.45 GHz, but this is not intended as a limitation. Conducting the above treatment of the material being cleared with the fixing liquid with irradiation by microwaves makes it possible to further promote the clearing. The output of the microwaves being irradiated can be suitably determined taking into account the type and magnitude of the material being cleared and the quantity of fixing liquid.</p>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The biological specimen that is the material being cleared is not specifically limited. For example, the biological specimen can be a fish, amphibian, reptile, or mammal, (however, excluding humans in the case of an entire organism). The biological specimen can also be a biological tissue. Every tissue of an organism can be targeted, such as an internal organ, blood vessel, nerve, the brain, or bone. A cleared specimen of a human organ or the like can be prepared from the view point of technique. For example, such would be suitably conducted in terms of ethical considerations by obtaining the approval of an ethics committee or the like. However, these are merely examples. So long as it is a biological specimen, there is no limitation. However, from the perspective of ease of clearing by means of treatment with a fixing liquid, the material that is being cleared can be a fish, amphibian, bird, mammal, or some tissue thereof.</p>
    <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The biological specimen that is the material that is being cleared can be subjected to a staining treatment in advance. The stain that is used in the staining treatment is not specifically limited. In addition to pigmented ink, stains such as fluorescent stains can also be employed.</p>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Following treatment with the fixing liquid, as needed, the material being cleared can be washed. Distilled water, buffer solution, ethylene glycol/PB(S), or the like can be employed for washing. The washing can be conducted at room temperature.</p>
    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">A bleaching treatment, degreasing treatment, or bleaching and degreasing treatment can be conducted during the treatment of the material being cleared with the fixing liquid, or during the treatment with the fixing liquid and after washing, as needed. For example, hydrogen peroxide can be used for bleaching, and for example, acetone or ethanol can be used for degreasing.</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In the method (A) for producing a cleared biological specimen, the treatment of the material being cleared with the fixing liquid yields a material that has been cleared. The material that has been cleared can be used as is in subsequent observation, for example. However, depending on the type of material being cleared, the clearing may sometimes be insufficient. Such materials being cleared can then be subjected to the method (B) for producing a cleared biological specimen of the present invention or the method (C) for producing a cleared biological specimen of the present invention to further promote the clearing. When storage is necessary, storage is desirably conducted by the method (C) for producing a cleared biological specimen of the present invention, described farther below.</p>

    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The method (B) for producing cleared biological specimens of the present invention comprises a step (2) of treating with a clearing-promoting liquid a material being cleared that has been obtained by fixing a biological specimen by a method other than method (A) for producing a cleared biological specimens of the present invention, or a material being cleared that has been treated with a fixing liquid in method (A) for producing cleared biological specimens of the present invention.</p>
    <heading id="h-00014-en">Step (2)</heading>
    <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The clearing-promoting liquid that is employed in step (2) is an aqueous solution comprising a nonionic surfactant and an alkali. The same nonionic surfactant and alkali as are employed in the fixing liquid can be employed.</p>
    <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The nonionic surfactant is a component that makes the biological specimen clear. Following fixation, the biological specimen is further cleared by the clearing-promoting liquid. The concentration of the nonionic surfactant in the clearing-promoting liquid, for example, falls within a range of 1 to 40 w/v%, and can be suitably selected based on the type of nonionic surfactant, the type of material being cleared, and the conditions of processing with the fixing liquid (including the composition of the fixing liquid). The concentration of the nonionic surfactant in the clearing-promoting liquid desirably falls within a range of 2 to 20 w/v%, preferably within a range of 5 to 10 w/v%. However, these ranges are not intended as limitations.</p>
    <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">As shown in Reference Example 1, there tend to be differences in clearing-promoting effects based on the HLB of the nonionic surfactant. As also shown in Reference Example 1, the clearing-promoting effect that is achieved when Tween 20 and Triton X-100 are employed in combination tends to be better than when they are employed singly. Although the reason for this is unclear, taking these points in account, the type and concentration of the nonionic surfactant can be suitably selected within a range that is suited to promoting clearing.</p>
    <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The alkali is a component for biological (protein) digestion. The concentration thereof can be suitably selected taking into account the degree of biological (protein) digestion in the same manner as for the fixing liquid. For example, it can fall within a range of 0.1 to 10 w/v%, desirably within a range of 0.5 to 2 w/v%. It is not necessary for the clearing-promoting liquid to contain a buffer (but a buffer can be contained as needed). The biological (protein) digesting effect due to the alkali is stronger than that of the fixing liquid. However, since moderate digestion is first conducted by the fixing liquid, even when a clearing-promoting liquid that does not contain a buffer is employed, the tissue is not markedly damaged. However, depending on the type of tissue, the concentration of the alkali is desirably adjusted and clearing is desirably promoted while inhibiting tissue damage.</p>
    <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The material being cleared is a material being cleared that has been treated with a fixing liquid in the method (A) for producing cleared biological specimens of the present invention or a material being cleared that has been obtained by fixing a biological specimen by a method other than the method (A) for producing cleared biological specimens of the present invention. The method other than the method (A) for producing cleared biological specimens of the present invention can be a conventionally known method. For example, it can be a method of treating a biological specimen with an aqueous solution that contains formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde, but does not contain a nonionic surfactant, or does not contain an alkali, or does not contain either. The aqueous solution that contains formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde, but does not contain a nonionic surfactant, or does not contain an alkali, or does not contain either, for example, can contain a 2 to 4% formaldehyde aqueous solution, a 2 to 4% paraformaldehyde aqueous solution, a 2 to 4% formaldehyde phosphate buffer, or a 2 to 4% paraformaldehyde phosphate buffer.</p>
    <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The treatment of the material being cleared with the clearing-promoting liquid, for example, can be conducted by immersing the material being cleared in a prescribed quantity (a quantity at least sufficient to fully immerse the material being cleared in the clearing-promoting liquid) of the clearing-promoting liquid at room temperature (for example, 5 to 35°C, desirably 15 to 30°C, identical below) or at a temperature within a range of 60°C from room temperature, for a period falling within a range of from 10 minutes to 48 hours, desirably within a range of from 30 minutes to 24 hours, and preferably within a range of from 1 to 12 hours. A high temperature tends to rapidly produce a clearing-promoting effect. However, depending on the type of material being cleared, there is considerable risk of damaging the tissue. Taking this point into account, the treatment temperature is desirably suitably adjusted. However, the above temperatures and times are merely examples and limitation to these scopes is not intended.</p>
    <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The treatment of the material being cleared with the clearing-promoting liquid can be conducted while irradiating microwaves during some portion or all of the treatment operation. The frequency of the microwaves can be, for example, 2.45 GHz. However, this is not intended as a limitation. Conducting the above treatment of the material being cleared with the clearing-promoting liquid while irradiating microwaves makes it possible to promote clearing and rapidly achieve transparency. In particular, conducting the above treatment of the material being cleared with the clearing-promoting liquid with irradiation with microwaves at 40 to 50 °C makes it possible to achieve clearing without damaging the specimen within a relatively short period of about 10 to 90 minutes. The output of the microwaves that are irradiated can be suitably determined by taking into account the type and size of the material being cleared and the quantity of clearing-promoting liquid.</p>
    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Treating the material being cleared with the clearing-promoting liquid yields a cleared biological specimen. The cleared biological specimen thus obtained can be used as is in subsequent observation, for example. However, depending on the type of material being cleared, there will be cases where adequate clearing is not achieved. Such materials being cleared can then be subjected to the method (C) for producing a cleared biological specimen of the present invention to further promote clearing. In cases where storage is necessary, it is also desirable to apply the method (C) for producing a cleared biological sample of the present invention and conduct storage.</p>
    <heading id="h-00015-en">&lt; Method (C) for clearing a biological sample&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Method (C) for clearing a biological sample of the present invention comprises a step (3) of obtaining a material that has been cleared by treating with a storage liquid or storing a material being cleared that has been subjected to a fixing treatment in the method (A) of producing a cleared biological specimen of the present invention or a material being cleared that has been treated with a fixing liquid and a clearing-promoting liquid in the method (B) for producing a cleared biological specimen of the present invention.</p>
    <heading id="h-00016-en">Step (3)</heading>
    <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The storage liquid that is used in step (3) is an aqueous solution comprising a nonionic surfactant and a polyhydric alcohol, in which the concentration of the nonionic surfactant is 1% or greater. The nonionic surfactant is a component for clearing the biological sample, and a component that maintains the transparency of the biological sample once it has been cleared. The same nonionic surfactants as are employed in the fixing liquid and the clearing-promoting liquid can be employed.</p>
    <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046"> The concentration of the nonionic surfactant in the storage liquid can fall within a range of 1 to 40%, by way of example. This concentration can be suitably selected based on the type of nonionic surfactant, the type of material being cleared, and the conditions of treatment with the fixing liquid and/or clearing-promoting liquid (including the composition of the fixing liquid and/or that of the clearing-promoting liquid). Keeping the material being cleared in a storage liquid after it has been treated with the clearing-promoting liquid will sometimes further promote clearing and maintain transparency. In the same manner as for the fixing liquid and the clearing-promoting liquid, the HLB of the nonionic surfactant tends to produce differences in the effects of promoting clearing and maintaining transparency. Further, as shown in Reference Example 1, the combined use of Tween 20 and Triton X-100 achieves a better clearing-promoting effect and transparency-maintaining effect than when either is used alone. Although the reason for this is unclear, it is possible to suitably select the type and concentration of the surfactant within ranges suited to maintaining transparency by taking these points into account.</p>
    <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The polyhydric alcohol is a component that promotes clearing. An example is glycol compounds. An example of a glycol compound is ethylene glycol. The concentration of the glycol compound can be suitably determined taking into account the transparency of the specimen. For example, a range of 1 to 50 w/v% is possible, and a range of 10 to 30 w/v% is desirable. However, these ranges are not intended as limitations.</p>
    <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In addition to a nonionic surfactant and a polyhydric alcohol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can be incorporated into the storage liquid. Incorporating DMSO further promotes the clearing. The content of DMSO can fall within a range of 0.5 to 10 v/v%, for example. The effect of adding DMSO varies with the type of tissue and organ being treated. In the case of most organs, a range of 0.5 to 10 v/v% is suitable. In the case of the brain, the addition of DMSO causes swelling, so a relatively small quantity falling within a range of 0.5 to 1 v/v% is suitable for long-term storage. For short-term observation, DMSO can be used in a range of up to 10 v/v%.</p>
    <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The material being treated for clearing that has been treated with the fixing liquid and/or clearing-promoting liquid is treated with the storage liquid by being immersed in a prescribed quantity of storage liquid (at least a quantity sufficient to fully immerse the material being cleared in the storage liquid) at room temperature (for example, 5 to 35°C, desirably 15 to 30°C, identical below) or at a temperature falling within a range of 60°C from room temperature for a period falling within a range of from 10 minutes to 48 hours, desirably within a range of from 30 minutes to 24 hours, and preferably falling within a range of from 1 to 12 hours. A high temperature tends to rapidly produce a clearing-promoting effect. However, depending on the type of material being cleared, there is a risk of great damage to the tissue. The treatment temperature is desirably suitably adjusted taking this point into account. However, the above temperature and periods are merely examples, and are not intended as limitations. In the case of storage, it is possible to store at room temperature as is.</p>
    <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The treatment of the material being cleared with the storage liquid can be conducted with microwave irradiation during part or all of the treatment operation. The frequency of the microwaves can be 2.45 GHz, for example, but this is not intended as a limitation. Treating the material being cleared with the storage liquid while irradiating it with microwaves promotes the clearing, making it possible to rapidly achieve clearing. Specifically, at a temperature of 40 to 50°C, treating the material being cleared with the storage liquid while irradiating it with microwaves makes it possible to relatively rapidly achieve clearing in about 10 to 90 minutes without damaging the specimen.

    <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Treating the material being cleared with the fixing liquid makes it possible to obtain a cleared biological specimen. The cleared biological specimen obtained can be subsequently used as is for observation, for example, or can be stored as is. However, depending on the type of material being cleared, clearing will sometimes be inadequate. For such materials being sized, repeatedly implementing steps (2) and (3) will promote the clearing. Alternatively, when clearing is insufficient, treatment can be conducted with the following additional clearing-promoting liquid. Treatment with an additional clearing-promoting liquid can also be implemented on the cleared biological specimen obtained by the method of (A) or (B) for clearing a biological specimen.</p>

The material being cleared that is obtained following immersion in the additional clearing-promoting liquid can then be maintained in the above storage liquid to obtain a cleared material. Trivalent alcohol is a component that further promotes clearing. This treatment will sometimes further promote clearing. An example of a trivalent alcohol is glycerol. Treatment with an additional clearing-promoting liquid is effective when increasing the transparency of bone and nerve fiber, for example.</p>
    <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The treatment with an additional clearing-promoting liquid of the material being cleared that has been treated with a fixing liquid, clearing-promoting liquid, or storage liquid is conducted, for example, by immersion in a prescribed quantity of storage liquid (a quantity at least adequate to fully immerse the material being cleared in the additional clearing-promoting liquid) at room temperature (for example, from 5 to 35°C, desirably 15 to 30°C, identical below) or at a temperature falling within a range of 60°C from room temperature for a period falling within a range of from 30 minutes to 48 hours, desirably within a range of from 1 to 24 hours, and preferably within a range of from 1 to 12 hours. A high temperature tends to rapidly produce a clearing-enhancing effect. However, depending on the type of material being cleared, there is a risk of great damage to the tissue.

The present method is characterized in that the entire specimen becomes cleared like glass. It is also characterized in that when compared to a cleared specimen prepared with convention glycerol or Scale reagent, the transparency is much higher and the tissue is harder. Simultaneously with clearing, ossified portions are intensified in white (which is thought to be the effect of Tween 20 or both Tween 20 and ethylene glycol).

    <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">As shown in <figref>Figure 4</figref>, the E14 mouse fetus was highly cleared. The degree of transparency was so high that it was difficult to recognize soft tissue with the naked eye. In addition to clearing of soft tissue, portions in extremely early stages of ossification were stained white (presumed to be the effect of Tween 20). Thus, without conducting separate bone staining, application as a bone staining method of extremely high sensitivity was possible (cartilage portions were not stained). The placenta was also cleared.</p>

      <figref>Figure 8</figref> shows the brain of a mature female C57B6/J mouse. Following treatment with a mixed solution of 2% formaldehyde phosphate buffer, 5% Triton X-100, and 1% KOH (room temperature, overnight), degreasing was conducted with a mixed solution of acetone and ethylene glycol at room temperature for 72 hours. The results are given in <figref>Figure 8(A)</figref>. Results obtained by treatment with promoting liquid 3 (room temperature, 12 hours) and storage liquid 3 (room temperature, 24 hours) are given in <figref>Figure 8(B)</figref>.

    <p id="p-00113-en" num="0113">The milk-white precipitate component that formed in the white matter (nerve fiber) was unknown. However, the precipitate was removed by incubation for 12 to 48 hours at 50°C in storage liquid 3. The results are given in <figref>Figure 8(C)</figref>. The white precipitate nearly completely disappeared, but some turbidity was found in the white matter fiber with dark field observation. It was possible to observe under a microscope the blood vessels running beneath the outer surface of the brain from the dorsal cortex surface.</p>
    <p id="p-00114-en" num="0114">- An additional treatment with glycerol further enhanced the clearing (particularly the clearing of white matter). The results are given in Tables 9-1 and 9-2. Transparency with storing liquid 3 was adequately high, but transparency fell off somewhat in the deep white matter (nerve fiber). When a brain that had been cleared with the storage liquid was placed in 100% glycerol, the transparency of the entire specimen was rapidly and markedly enhanced, and the turbidity in the white matter disappeared. Better results (enhanced transparency) were achieved for storage in the present experiment by returning to storage liquid 3 rather than 60% glycerol.</p>
