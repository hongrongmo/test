      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Pleated filter materials have proven to be useful in many gas and/or fluid filtering applications where space is limited and/or where a large effective filtering surface area is desired within a confined space. Pleated filter materials may also be utilized to minimize the pressure drop across the filter media during the filtering process. Some filter cartridges include pleated filter media with metal reinforcing housings, mesh, or banding structures to contain and support the filter media. Often, the metal reinforcement material can be expensive, bulky, and challenging to manufacture. Some of these reinforcing structures may be attached to the filter media with an adhesive that may degrade in corrosive or high temperature environments.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A need remains for improved filter media, reinforcement material, and methods for imparting structural support to pleated filter media.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Embodiments of the invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Certain embodiments of the invention may enable imparting structural support to a pleated filter material. In an example embodiment, a thermoplastic elastomer material (herein referred to as âiPLASâ) may be extruded and applied externally on a rolled section of pleated media to impart structural support. According to example embodiments, iPLAS retaining material may be applied on an inner diameter of the rolled pleated material to provide structural support for a filter made with pleated filter material. In accordance with certain example embodiments, the iPLAS retaining material may be extruded and applied in one or more continuous loops on the outer and/or inner diameter of the pleated media element. In accordance with example embodiments, the iPLAS retaining material may be extruded and applied to maintain shape, pleat spacing and/or relative position of the pleats.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">According to example embodiments of the invention, the iPLAS material may be extruded and applied to the pleated filter material in a semi-liquid form, with viscosity and flow controlled at least in part by temperature. According to certain example embodiments, the iPLAS material, in its heated or semi-liquid state, may partially absorb into a depth of the pleated filter material upon application, and may become attached, entangled, or fused within at least a portion of the filter's fiber structure. Then, according to an example embodiment, when the iPLAS material cools and becomes a substantially solid support structure, the portion of the thermoplastic in contact with the filter material may be attached to the tips of the pleated filter material without additional adhesive.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">According to example embodiments of the invention, filters made using the methods described herein may be suitable for imparting strength to filters for structural integrity and to prevent ripping or damage to the filter during filtering and/or during reverse pulse cleaning processes.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">As indicated in the background section above, a typical pulse or static filter cartridge contains filter media sandwiched between two layers of expandable metal mesh. The metal mesh layers create a rigid cage around the filter element. In contrast, and according to example embodiments of the invention, one or more of the metal mesh layers may be replaced by the iPLAS material. In one example embodiment, a filter cartridge may include iPLAS material instead of expandable metal reinforcement on the outer diameter. In another example embodiment, a filter cartridge may include iPLAS material instead of expandable metal reinforcement on the inner diameter. In another example embodiment, a filter cartridge may include iPLAS material instead of expandable metal reinforcement on both the inner and outer diameters, thereby sandwiching the pleated filter material between bands of iPLAS. In an example embodiment, the iPLAS band may be configured to provide structural support, similar to the metal mesh, but the iPLAS may provide additional exposure of the filtration media to the surrounding plenum, which may be beneficial during filtering and/or during the reverse pulse cleaning process.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Various thermoplastic elastomer extrusion configurations in conjunction with pleated filter media may be utilized for preparing filter cartridges, according to example embodiments of the invention, and will now be described with reference to the accompanying figures.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example filter house <b>100</b>, according to an example embodiment, for which embodiments of the invention may be utilized. For example, the filter house <b>100</b> may include an array of filter cartridges <b>102</b>. In an example embodiment, un-filtered air <b>104</b> may enter the filter house <b>100</b> via an unfiltered air plenum <b>106</b> in communication with at least one side of the filter cartridges <b>102</b> (in this case, for example, an exterior side). In an example embodiment, impurities may be removed from the input air <b>104</b> air passing through the filter cartridges <b>102</b>, and the clean air on the interior part of the filter cartridges <b>102</b> may travel through a clean air plenum <b>108</b>.
